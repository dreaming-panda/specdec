Article: Just over a decade ago Gianfranco Zola was voted the greatest Chelsea player of all time in a poll of the club's supporters. This may seem a little premature, but as Eden Hazard prepares for to make his 100th Barclays Premier League appearance for Chelsea at QPR on Sunday, the little magician could have a rival in years to come. Hazard is some player, one of the elite in English football with those dazzling runs and the sparkling feet that can open up the best defences in the league. Eden Hazard has developed into one of the world's best players after flourishing at Chelsea. Hazard has proven himself as a goalscorer and a creator of chances during his time with Chelsea. Hazard celebrates scoring against Hull earlier this season as Chelsea march towards the Premier League title. This season he has been imperious, full of movement and flexibility as Chelsea close in on a double of Capital One Cup and Premier League in Jose Mourinho's second season back at Stamford Bridge. After Chelsea's 1-1 draw with Paris Saint-Germain in February at the Parc des Princes, Mourinho demanded more protection from referees for Hazard. Chelsea's dancing winger is a marked man. The PFA young player of the year had been fouled nine times, with Laurent Blanc's team taking it in turns to nobble the Chelsea No 10 in the first leg of their Champions League second round tie. He has scored some special goals, 17 so far with another nine assists, as Mourinho's team close in on a fourth Premier League title in the Abramovich era. On Sunday, April 26 the PFA players' player of the year award could be his, joining a list of winners that includes Luis Suarez, Gareth Bale, Wayne Rooney, Cristiano Ronaldo, Thierry Henry and his Chelsea team-mate John Terry in recent times. He has grown to love English football, adapting to the demands of the Premier League and the numerous managers he has already played for since his move from Lille in 2012. Roberto Di Matteo was still Chelsea's manager when Hazard tweeted that he was joining 'this season's Champions League winner' ahead of his £32million move from France. He made an impressive start in the Premier League, assisting the opening goal for Chelsea in the 2-0 victory at Wigan and winning the penalty for Frank Lampard to convert at the DW Stadium. Hazard joined Chelsea from Lille for £32million in 2012 after the Blues beat a host to clubs to his signature. Hazard was involved in a controversial incident at Swansea when he kicked the ball as it lay under the ball boy. Hazard was sent off after the ball-boy incident as Chelsea were beaten in the Capital One Cup semi-final. Hazard, his wife Natasha and their kids enjoy some off time at Disneyland Paris. Di Matteo loved him as a player and he went through a notable dip in form when the European Cup-winning coach was fired after the 4-1 defeat against Juventus in the Champions League. A few months later he was sent off when he infamously wrestled with a ball-boy during Chelsea's Capital One Cup semi-final defeat against Swansea City at the Liberty Stadium. He finished the season with a Europa League medal after Chelsea's victory over Benfica the Amsterdam ArenA, but it is the arrival of Mourinho that has transformed his game. Last season there was a period of frustration among Chelsea's first team players because they shared the view of the coach that they had signed a world class talent. Despite his ability he was often one of the first to leave after training, heading home to his family - wife Natasha and their two young children, after a quick shower and lunch with his team-mates. Slowly he has bought into dressing room culture. There is a ruthless streak about him these days and Mourinho, to his credit, drew it out of him after meeting Hazard's father, along with his lawyer, after Belgium's disappointing World Cup in Brazil. Hazard has grown in stature since he was handed Juan Mata's old No 10 shirt, requesting the jersey after the winger left for Manchester United in January 2014. The No 10 shirt is also the number of his hero Zinedine Zidane, the player a young Hazard idolised when he was making his way through Belgian football before his move to Lille. In recent times he has been encouraged to drift across the front three positions, interchanging with Oscar (in the centre) and Willian (on the right) when it takes his fancy. Hazard helped Chelsea win the Europa League under Rafa Benitez when they beat Benfica in the final. Hazard, pictured alongside Luis Suarez, was named the PFA Young Player of the Year last season. Hazard added a second trophy to his Chelsea collection this season when the Blues won the Capital One Cup. Jose Mourinho transformed Hazard's game after he suffered a dip following the departure of Roberto Di Matteo. Mourinho poses with Hazard after he was named Chelsea's Player of the Year last season. He is the focal point of Chelsea's attack, a willing outlet with a first touch that you can melt when he takes it on the instep of his right boot. He has been scoring goals again, adding to his tally this season in recent weeks with strikes for club and country as the season hurtles towards the finish line. At 24 he is maturing nicely, a humble man who impressed Chelsea's hierarchy during the complex negotiations over a new contract towards the end of last year. He has never been responsible for the glut of stories linking him with a move back to France to play for Paris Saint-Germain and he consistently told the club that he was willing to remain at Stamford Bridge. Hazard's contract talks were reminiscent of Gary Neville at Manchester United, leaving it with the club to determine the terms on his new five-year contract. Chelsea settled on £200,000 a week. To those who know him, he speaks of trophies and a hunger to be remembered as a player who contributed to one of the most successful periods in Chelsea's history. Given time, he could even be remembered as the very best. Hazard recently signed a bumper new five-year deal at Chelsea worth £200,000 a week. In Hazard, Gianfranco Zola may soon have a rival as Chelsea's greatest ever player.

Eden Hazard will make his 100th league appearance for Chelsea on Sunday. The Belgian's form dipped when Roberto Di Matteo left the club. But Jose Mourinho's return helped take Hazard to another level. The midfielder has slowly bought into the dressing room culture. Initially he was one of the first to leave the training ground. In time, he could rival Gianfranco Zola as the club's greatest player.

Article: Most parents have the souvenir of a scan of their child in the womb at 12 weeks. The must-have for IVF mums and dads these days, however, is a video and pictures right from the moment of conception. The images are thanks to revolutionary technology that allows medics to record the microscopic miracle of life – from fertilisation to the division of cells, right through to the growth of an embryo. Hundreds of parents are now the proud owners of these EmbryoScope images, which are also helping scientists learn more about the IVF process. Scroll down for video. Pictured is the very first cell division of Pixie Morley, now aged nine months, taken using the revolutionary EmbryoScope technology. Sally and Stephen Morley (pictured with their daughter Pixie) are one of some 1,500 couples in Britain who have had babies using EmbryoScope technology. Sally and Stephen Morley are among them. The grainy grey and white picture on this page shows the first cell division in the creation of their IVF baby, Pixie. A tiny camera, placed inside an incubator, films the reproduction process. As well as allowing parents to watch back the moment the embryos form, the technology – developed in the US – also allows experts to select the best possible embryos based on how they form during the conception process. This narrows a mother’s chance of miscarrying. The Morleys, from Walsall, had spent months trying to have children naturally before opting for IVF. Mrs Morley, 38, the head of a nursery, said: ‘I knew time was against me being 36 when we started trying so when I failed to get pregnant each month I knew we should have fertility tests as soon as possible.’ While the couple were undergoing IVF, the EmbryoScope technology was introduced at the Midland Fertility Clinic, allowing them to be the first in their area to capture their child’s conception on camera. The technology allows medics and parents to watch the cell dividing. Pictured is the cell division of now nine-month-old Pixie. In October 2013, the embryo was transferred into Mrs Morley’s womb and within two weeks she was told by doctors that the process had been successful. Now, nine months after Pixie’s birth, she is still able to re-watch the moment her daughter was conceived. Experts have hailed the technology as one of the most important developments in IVF. Professor Simon Fishel, who is boss of Care Fertility, the first clinic in Britain to use the EmbryoScope, said: ‘We now know that embryos that do make babies and embryos that don’t make babies do different things. 'And to be able to see this in a time-matched movie and to be able to analyse it scientifically is absolutely wonderful science for us.’ Professor Fishel, who was part of the team that produced first test-tube baby, Louise Brown, in 1978, said the EmbryoScope was revealing the secrets about what happens to embryos as they develop – and why it is that around 70 per cent of them do not actually make babies. The videos were also an emotional milestone in the process of becoming a parent, Professor Fishel said. ‘The couple can see the process of fertilisation, see the cells divide, see the number of cells grow and see them produce an embryo…it is nothing short of observing the wonderful miracle of life.’ The video given to parents is a sped-up version of the process which occurs before the embryo develops. Professor Fishel said his patients were ‘awestruck’ when given the footage but that the clinic only gave parents the video once a mother had fallen pregnant. He added that, at across the Care Fertility clinics, 1,000 couples, who had gone on to have a baby, had been given footage of their embryo’s development.

Article: (CNN)The Palestinian Authority officially became the 123rd member of the International Criminal Court on Wednesday, a step that gives the court jurisdiction over alleged crimes in Palestinian territories. The formal accession was marked with a ceremony at The Hague, in the Netherlands, where the court is based. The Palestinians signed the ICC's founding Rome Statute in January, when they also accepted its jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed "in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, since June 13, 2014." Later that month, the ICC opened a preliminary examination into the situation in Palestinian territories, paving the way for possible war crimes investigations against Israelis. As members of the court, Palestinians may be subject to counter-charges as well. Israel and the United States, neither of which is an ICC member, opposed the Palestinians' efforts to join the body. But Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad al-Malki, speaking at Wednesday's ceremony, said it was a move toward greater justice. "As Palestine formally becomes a State Party to the Rome Statute today, the world is also a step closer to ending a long era of impunity and injustice," he said, according to an ICC news release. "Indeed, today brings us closer to our shared goals of justice and peace." Judge Kuniko Ozaki, a vice president of the ICC, said acceding to the treaty was just the first step for the Palestinians. "As the Rome Statute today enters into force for the State of Palestine, Palestine acquires all the rights as well as responsibilities that come with being a State Party to the Statute. These are substantive commitments, which cannot be taken lightly," she said. Rights group Human Rights Watch welcomed the development. "Governments seeking to penalize Palestine for joining the ICC should immediately end their pressure, and countries that support universal acceptance of the court's treaty should speak out to welcome its membership," said Balkees Jarrah, international justice counsel for the group. "What's objectionable is the attempts to undermine international justice, not Palestine's decision to join a treaty to which over 100 countries around the world are members." In January, when the preliminary ICC examination was opened, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described it as an outrage, saying the court was overstepping its boundaries. The United States also said it "strongly" disagreed with the court's decision. "As we have said repeatedly, we do not believe that Palestine is a state and therefore we do not believe that it is eligible to join the ICC," the State Department said in a statement. It urged the warring sides to resolve their differences through direct negotiations. "We will continue to oppose actions against Israel at the ICC as counterproductive to the cause of peace," it said. But the ICC begs to differ with the definition of a state for its purposes and refers to the territories as "Palestine." While a preliminary examination is not a formal investigation, it allows the court to review evidence and determine whether to investigate suspects on both sides. Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said her office would "conduct its analysis in full independence and impartiality." The war between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza last summer left more than 2,000 people dead. The inquiry will include alleged war crimes committed since June. The International Criminal Court was set up in 2002 to prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. CNN's Vasco Cotovio, Kareem Khadder and Faith Karimi contributed to this report.

Article: Whatever you call them, it's always something of a surprise when a game between the biggest and best teams in any country actually turns out to be a footballing classic. Real Madrid and Barcelona attract viewers, but the cynicism on the pitch can drown out the quality in El Clasico. Borussia Dortmund are not consistently good enough to make Der Klassiker a regular spectacle. English football's closest equivalent, Liverpool taking on Manchester United, is now merely a battle for the top four. But, on Easter Sunday, Marseille and Paris St Germain played out a game that not only had a huge bearing on the Ligue 1 title race, but also easily lived up to it's billing as Le Classique. Paris St Germain players celebrate their win in the dressing room after the game, after twice coming from behind to beat rivals Marseille. Andre-Pierre Gignac gets up above Marquinhos to power home the opening goal for Marseille after half an hour. Blaise Matuidi is congratulated by his team-mates after bringing PSG level with a superb curling effort from the edge of the box. Gignac fires home his second goal past Salvatore Sirigu after a mistake from Marco Veratti gave him a clear run on goal, to make it 2-1. Marquinhos jumps for joy after slamming the ball into the roof of the net to make it 2-2 after Zlatan Ibrahimovic's mis-hit free kick. Ibrahimovic put pressure on Jeremy Morel to force an own goal just two minutes later, as PSG went ahead for the first time in the game. Marseille: Mandanda, Romao, Fanni, Morel, Lemina, Dja Djédjé, Mendy, Payet, Thauvin (Ocampos 63 mins), Gignac (Batshuayi 71), Ayew (Alessandrini 72) Subs not used: Aloe, N'Koulou, Samba, Tuiloma. Goals: Gignac 30, 43. Booked: Romao, Fanni, Ayew, Gignac. PSG: Sirigu, Marquinhos, Thiago Silva, David Luiz (Van der Wiel 34), Maxwell, Verratti, Motta, Matuidi, Pastore (Rabiot 82), Ibrahimovic, Cavani (Lavezzi 59),. Subs not used: Douchez, Cabaye, Bahebeck, Digne. Goals: Matuidi 35 Marquinhos 49, Morel OG 51. Booked: Veratti, Pastore. In the end it was PSG who ran out winners, but they twice had to come from behind to see off their fierce rivals in a game that had passion, quality, and goals aplenty. The game was decided by a 130-second burst soon after the half-time break, in which the visitors came from 2-1 down to go 3-2 ahead, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic, predictably, involved in both goals, though not perhaps, in the way that would be expected. First the Swedish star slipped as he struck a free kick at goal, only to see his nothing effort land at the feet of Brazilian defender Marquinhos, who slammed the ball into the roof of the net from close range. Just two minutes later Ibrahimovic might have been on hand to tap home Javier Pastore's low cross, but in the end his presence was enough to force defender Jeremy Morel to divert it past his own goalkeeper. It felt harsh on Marseille, who were the better side for large periods, but they were let down by defensive frailties and an inability to really punhish the PSG backline. Despite the hosts dominance of possession, the champions could easily have won this by three or four goals, such were their chances. Ibrahimovic had several excellent opportunities, the last of which saw Steve Mandanda pull off a remarkable save, while Pastore should have scored at least once, and Mandanda also did well to deny Matuidi late on. All of that without considering the chances the visitors missed before falling behind in the first half, with Ibrahimovic denied a penalty following a clumsy tackle by Morel, Pastore firing wide when clean through, and the woefully out of form Edinson Cavani scuffing a volley straight at the keeper after being picked out by a beautiful chipped pass. Zlatan Ibrahimovic (left) challenges for the ball against Jeremy Morel in the crucial top of the table clash in Ligue 1 on Easter Sunday. Dimitri Payet gets a shot away under pressure from Marco Veratti of PSG in the Stade Veledrome as Marseille looked to take home advantage. On the other hand it is difficult to remember Salvatore Sirigu making too many meaningful saves in the second half, although he did acrobatically tip a Gignac header over the bar shortly before the break to deny the striker a hat-trick. With Lyon having briefly gone top of the table by beating Guingamp earlier in the weekend, it was a game both sides really needed to win to keep up their title challenges. The result puts Laurent Blanc's men top of Ligue 1 again, and is a serious dent to Marseille's hopes. It all looked so different at half time, when an Andre-Pierre Gignac double had his side 2-1 up. The local-born hero first rose above Marquinhos at the back post to head past Sirigu on the half-hour, before slotting past the Italian shortly before half time to restore the lead. Both goals had an element of fortune, with Gignac climbing all over his defender to convert Dimitri Payet's cross, and Marco Veratti gifting him possession through on goal for the second, but nonetheless he took both well. In between was the pick of the goals, a stunner from Blaise Matuidi, who cut inside beautifully, before curling in from the edge of the box, via the fingertips of Mandanda and the inside of the post. PSG's win was marred only by an injury to David Luiz, withdrawn in the first half with what looked like a hamstring pull. But a win over their fierce rivals, and the return to the table's summit, will soften that blow. David Luiz is brought down, and the Brazilian defender was forced off soon after with a hamstring injury which looked serious. Marseille took the lead twice in the first half, but on both occasions they were unable to stay ahead for too long. Gignac celebrates his second goal, and the Marseille striker was only denied his hat-trick by an acrobatic save from Sirigu. Ibrahimovic looks on unimpressed during a difficult first half for the French champions, but his side kept responding to going behind. Marquihos wheels away after scoring his goal, which made the score 2-2 early in the second half, and changed the momentum of the game. The fiery atmosphere bubbled over late on, as Ezequiel Lavezzi was targeted with missiles and laser pointers while trying to take a corner. The home fans produced a passionate atmosphere in the cauldron of the Veledrome as they pursued the French title against their rivals.

Andre-Pierre Gignac puts Marseille ahead on half-hour with powerful back-post header from Dimitri Payet cross. Blaise Matuidi equalises five minutes later with a stunning strike from the edge of the box. Gignac capitalises on terrible PSG defending to restore Marseille's lead before half time. Marquinhos brings PSG level again, before Jeremy Morel own goal puts champions ahead moments later.

Article: (CNN)Never mind cats having nine lives. A stray pooch in Washington State has used up at least three of her own after being hit by a car, apparently whacked on the head with a hammer in a misguided mercy killing and then buried in a field -- only to survive. That's according to Washington State University, where the dog -- a friendly white-and-black bully breed mix now named Theia -- has been receiving care at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital. Four days after her apparent death, the dog managed to stagger to a nearby farm, dirt-covered and emaciated, where she was found by a worker who took her to a vet for help. She was taken in by Moses Lake, Washington, resident Sara Mellado. "Considering everything that she's been through, she's incredibly gentle and loving," Mellado said, according to WSU News. "She's a true miracle dog and she deserves a good life." Theia is only one year old but the dog's brush with death did not leave her unscathed. She suffered a dislocated jaw, leg injuries and a caved-in sinus cavity -- and still requires surgery to help her breathe. The veterinary hospital's Good Samaritan Fund committee awarded some money to help pay for the dog's treatment, but Mellado has set up a fundraising page to help meet the remaining cost of the dog's care. She's also created a Facebook page to keep supporters updated. Donors have already surpassed the $10,000 target, inspired by Theia's tale of survival against the odds. On the fundraising page, Mellado writes, "She is in desperate need of extensive medical procedures to fix her nasal damage and reset her jaw. I agreed to foster her until she finally found a loving home." She is dedicated to making sure Theia gets the medical attention she needs, Mellado adds, and wants to "make sure she gets placed in a family where this will never happen to her again!" Any additional funds raised will be "paid forward" to help other animals. Theia is not the only animal to apparently rise from the grave in recent weeks. A cat in Tampa, Florida, found seemingly dead after he was hit by a car in January, showed up alive in a neighbor's yard five days after he was buried by his owner. The cat was in bad shape, with maggots covering open wounds on his body and a ruined left eye, but remarkably survived with the help of treatment from the Humane Society.

Newcastle had what looked a strong shout for a penalty when Dejan Lovren appeared to foul Ayoze Perez in the area, and Allen admitted he thought it was a spot-kick. 'I did get a good view of it as I'd missed the ball in the build-up,' he said. 'It look a good shout for a penalty, but I didn't get one the other night. These things happen.'

Article: Stuart McCall  watched Rangers bounce back to winning ways before warning his players they must show further improvement in the push for promotion. The Ibrox side recovered from their defeat against Queen of the South as two goals from Nicky Law and one each from Nicky Clark and Haris Vuckic swamped Raith Rovers in a 4-0 victory. McCall, though, wasn’t happy with some of lax moments within their performance and insisted that better will be needed for Wednesday night’s trip to face a Livingston side fighting for survival. Nicky Law celebrates after putting his side 3-0 up as Rangers cruised to victory over Raith. That meeting with the Championship’s bottom club is Rangers’ game in hand over Hibernian, providing the chance to push three points clear in the battle for second place. ‘It was okay,’ reflected McCall on the victory over Rovers, who are locked in mid-table safety. ‘There were some nice goals, although we were sloppy at times. ‘For a little period in the second-half of 20 minutes, we went through the motions and we can’t afford to do that. ‘It was pleasing in a few senses with some nice goals, some decent football and a clean sheet. ‘But we certainly know that Wednesday night will be a different challenge. I was at the Alloa versus Dumbarton game on Saturday and you could sense that Alloa had everything to play for and Dumbarton nothing bar pride, obviously. ‘I thought the game today might pan out as it did, but Wednesday will be different with Livingston flying in terms of their recent results. ‘There is no singing and dancing today. We have done OK. I still think that we’ll need to be better and we can be better,’ said McCall. Stuart McCall has warned Rangers to be on their guard against Livingston in midweek. The pick of the Rangers goals again came from Vuckic, who has scored in each of his last five Ibrox appearances. The Newcastle United loanee has netted seven times in 12 Rangers outings overall. ‘We tried to swap it around by playing a diamond and by getting Haris into more space,’ added McCall, who expects another of the loanees, Shane Ferguson, to begin training with Rangers today. ‘But he still tends to head for the right-hand side, which is his favourite. ‘Every time he cuts in onto his left, you expect the net to bulge. ‘We had good footballers in there with him, Nicky Law, Dean Shiels and Andrew Murdoch, who I thought was terrific again. ‘I said from day one that Haris has got fantastic ability. ‘Obviously, he has got fitter having played more games now, and his match fitness is now looking strong at the end of games where he was flagging after 50 or 60 minutes earlier. ‘That’s just having more time on the park. He is important to us and he is a goal threat.’ Nicky Clark (left) heads it home to give Rangers an early lead. Raith Rovers manager Grant Murray feels Rangers have improved under McCall, but he also believes that whichever Championship side comes through the play-offs will face a difficult task to clear the final promotion hurdle. ‘They still have to go and play a Premier League team and there is a good chance that that team will have a winning mentality,’ said Murray. ‘People are talking about Ross County or Motherwell - well it won’t be an easy task going to these kind of places. ‘I think everyone is talking about how Rangers have picked up now and they look like a strong team who will finish second. ‘Hibs have had a fantastic season, too, in terms of the attacking football they play, but I think Queen of the South are also keeping themselves in there. ‘We knew Rangers would come at us after losing on Thursday and we knew it would be difficult. It is difficult coming to places like this and you have to stand up and have the right mentality. But going a goal down so early put us on the back foot.’

Rangers beat Raith 4-0 but McCall is aware of tough test Livingston will provide in midweek. He said he was concerned about some lax moments in the win at Ibrox. Rangers can go three points clear of Hibernian with a win. 'There is no singing and dancing today. We have done OK. I still think that we’ll need to be better and we can be better,' McCall said.

Article: It seems Samir Nasri was keen to forget about Manchester City's defeat at Crystal Palace as the Frenchman went out with his girlfriend Anara Atanes in London. After coming on as a substitute for the final 13 minutes of Monday's 2-1 loss at Selhurst Park, the City winger was pictured leaving Hakkasan  in the capital on Tuesday night, an award-winning Michelin star restaurant which offers modern Cantonese cuisine. Manuel Pellegrini's side are now nine points behind Premier League leaders Chelsea and Nasri could be leaving Manchester this summer. Manchester City midfielder Samir Nasri dined out in London with girlfriend Anara Atanes on Tuesday night. The pair dined at Hakassan, an award-winning Michelin star restaurant offering modern Cantonese cuisine.

Article: (CNN)If you've been following the news lately, there are certain things you doubtless know about Mohammad Javad Zarif. He is, of course, the Iranian foreign minister. He has been U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's opposite number in securing a breakthrough in nuclear discussions that could lead to an end to sanctions against Iran -- if the details can be worked out in the coming weeks. And he received a hero's welcome as he arrived in Iran on a sunny Friday morning. "Long live Zarif," crowds chanted as his car rolled slowly down the packed street. You may well have read that he is "polished" and, unusually for one burdened with such weighty issues, "jovial." An Internet search for "Mohammad Javad Zarif" and "jovial" yields thousands of results. He certainly has gone a long way to bring Iran in from the cold and allow it to rejoin the international community. But there are some facts about Zarif that are less well-known. Here are six:. In September 2013, Zarif tweeted "Happy Rosh Hashanah," referring to the Jewish New Year. That prompted Christine Pelosi, the daughter of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, to respond with a tweet of her own: "Thanks. The New Year would be even sweeter if you would end Iran's Holocaust denial, sir." And, perhaps to her surprise, Pelosi got a response. "Iran never denied it," Zarif tweeted back. "The man who was perceived to be denying it is now gone. Happy New Year." The reference was likely to former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who had left office the previous month. Zarif was nominated to be foreign minister by Ahmadinejad's successor, Hassan Rouhami. His foreign ministry notes, perhaps defensively, that "due to the political and security conditions of the time, he decided to continue his education in the United States." That is another way of saying that he was outside the country during the demonstrations against the Shah of Iran, which began in 1977, and during the Iranian Revolution, which drove the shah from power in 1979. Zarif left the country in 1977, received his undergraduate degree from San Francisco State University in 1981, his master's in international relations from the University of Denver in 1984 and his doctorate from the University of Denver in 1988. Both of his children were born in the United States. The website of the Iranian Foreign Ministry, which Zarif runs, cannot even agree with itself on when he was born. The first sentence of his official biography, perhaps in a nod to the powers that be in Tehran, says Zarif was "born to a religious traditional family in Tehran in 1959." Later on the same page, however, his date of birth is listed as January 8, 1960. And the Iranian Diplomacy website says he was born in in 1961. So he is 54, 55 or maybe even 56. Whichever, he is still considerably younger than his opposite number, Kerry, who is 71. The feds investigated him over his alleged role in controlling the Alavi Foundation, a charitable organization. The U.S. Justice Department said the organization was secretly run on behalf of the Iranian government to launder money and get around U.S. sanctions. But last year, a settlement in the case, under which the foundation agreed to give a 36-story building in Manhattan along with other properties to the U.S. government, did not mention Zarif's name. Early in the Iranian Revolution, Zarif was among the students who took over the Iranian Consulate in San Francisco. The aim, says the website Iranian.com -- which cites Zarif's memoirs, titled "Mr. Ambassador" -- was to expel from the consulate people who were not sufficiently Islamic. Later, the website says, Zarif went to make a similar protest at the Iranian mission to the United Nations. In response, the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations offered him a job. In fact, he has now spent more time with Kerry than any other foreign minister in the world. And that amount of quality time will only increase as the two men, with help from other foreign ministers as well, try to meet a June 30 deadline for nailing down the details of the agreement they managed to outline this week in Switzerland.

Article: Dundee have vowed to stand by Paul McGowan after the bad boy midfielder was spared jail for a third assault on a policeman. But the Dens Park bad boy will miss two forthcoming games against former club Celtic because he is under house arrest. The 27-year-old has been placed on a 16-week restriction of liberty order which confines him to home between the hours of 7pm and 7am. And the Dark Blues face Ronny Deila's night next Wednesday night – before a Friday night trip to Parkhead on May 1. McGowan was handed his third conviction for assaulting a police officer at Airdrie Sheriff Court. As a St Mirren player he was sentenced to 130 hours of unpaid work and handed a one-year supervision order in January 2014 after admitting kicking two officers. The court heard McGowan 'charged towards' two police officers after a disturbance in Airdrie in the early hours of November 23 last year. He later kicked another officer on the body while being detained at Coatbridge police station. Paul McGowan avoided a prison sentence after a third assault on a policeman. Sheriff Derek O'Carroll spared the Dens star a prison sentence after hearing he had was undergoing counselling through PFA Scotland, the players' union, for a gambling problem in addition to social work sessions. In a statement Dundee vowed to support their player through his problems saying: 'The club does not condone the behaviour which has led to this and wouldn't from any member of our staff. 'We fully respect the decision made by the court and Dundee FC will be standing by the player. 'Paul is an integral part of the club and we will be working alongside the PFA with him as he bids to positively resolve his off the field issues. 'With the support of his manager, his teammates and club staff we hope Paul will be able to move forward and be part of another successful season next year at Dens Park. 'The club will be making no further comment on the matter.' His solicitor, Liam O'Donnell, told the court that social work reports 'finally give some indication that the accused is getting it in terms of his offending. He added: 'He was not in any trouble from the age of 16 to 23. At age 23 he separated from his partner. The reason he separated has been attributed to an underlying gambling problem. The 27-year-old Dundee midfielder pictured in action against Dundee United last week. 'This gambling problem seems to be the root of his offending. When he takes alcohol his anger about the gambling problem seems to come out through aggression.' O'Donnell revealed the former St Mirren player was undergoing voluntary counselling each week through the Paisley-based RCA Trust, which helps people with alcohol and gambling addictions. 'He is fully supported by his club,' he added. 'The managing director of Dundee Football Club is present in court to indicate his support because he is addressing matters.' After listening to the address, Sheriff O'Carroll reminded McGowan of the previous occasions he had been convicted of offences, in 2010 and 2013. 'And here you are again facing similar charges,' O'Carroll added. 'It's quite correct to say that you are on the cusp of custody and certainly that's in the thoughts of the court.' However, he proceeded to sentence McGowan to the tagging order provided he continues with the counselling. 'If you breach the order you will be brought back here and I have already advised you what the outcome will be,' the sheriff added. Dundee managing director John Nelms, who was accompanied in court by players including captain James McPake, declined to answer questions outside court. McGowan also declined to comment but O'Donnell said afterwards: 'He is relieved with the outcome and he knows he needs to modify his behaviour. He appreciates the support of his club and others.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Article: Juan Mata described Manchester United's 4-2 derby victory as a'massive win' as they opened up a four-point gap on Manchester City. United had lost their last four meetings with City but goals from Ashley Young, Marouane Fellaini, Mata and Chris Smalling gave the Red Devils their biggest derby win for six years. Sergio Aguero opened the scoring and also netted late on for his 100th City goal but United were by far the better team to tighten their grip on third spot in the Barclays Premier League. Old Trafford roars with Marouane Fellaini after the influential Belgian gave the Red Devils the lead. Wayne Rooney leaps onto Fellaini's back after United take the lead at Old Trafford in the Manchester derby. 'The first 10 or 15 minutes they were brilliant and played well but after that the team showed character and we came back,' Mata told Sky Sports 1. 'It's a massive win for us, it's a great result and everyone at United is happy. 'The atmosphere was crazy, it is something we will never forget. Juan Mata, released by Rooney, scores as Manchester United smash their rivals at Old Trafford. 'You could tell how important it was for the fans but we still have six games to go and we have to keep going. 'It's a big win and a boost of confidence but Arsenal are doing great and I'm sure City and Liverpool will fight to the end, so we have to fight to the last minute.' Young equalised Aguero's early strike and then set up Fellaini to give United a first-half lead. All of United's outfield players congratulate Chris Smalling after his close-range header ensured victory. 'We were disappointed to go a goal behind but we showed that team spirit to get back in the game and no other team was going to win it when we went ahead,' Young told Sky Sports 1. 'It was an amazing feeling to score. I was delighted to put the ball in the net and get an assist as well but the important thing was we showed that character to win the game. 'It was a magnificent win. We knew it was going to be a tough game but we knew we had to get the three points.' Ashley Young latches on to a loose ball which bounced off Gael Clichy and fires past the despairing Joe Hart.

Juan Mata scored as Manchester United thumped Manchester City. Victory sends Louis van Gaal's side four points clear of their rivals in third. Manchester United are now just one point adrift of second placed Arsenal. Mata has challenged his teammates to keep on fighting right to the end.

Article: Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina has a Premier League win ratio of 91.7 per cent - the highest of any player to have made at least 10 appearances. Following the Gunners' 1-0 win against Burnley at Turf Moor on Saturday, the Colombia international took his tally to 11 wins from 12 games since he displaced Wojciech Szczesny as No 1 in January. Ospina has kept six clean sheets in those 12 games with his only defeat coming against Tottenham in the north London derby on February 7 to boast an impressive win percentage. But who else makes the top 10? Ospina has the highest win ratio of any Premier League player to make more than 10 appearances. The Arsenal goalkeeper has won 11 of his 12 games in the league since displacing Wojciech Szczesny. Former Manchester City defender Stefan Savic (right) won 10 of his 11 games in the league before being sold. Former Manchester City defender Stefan Savic, who was deemed not good enough after making just 11 Premier League appearances before being sold to Fiorentina, is second behind Ospina. The Montenegro international has a win ratio of 90.9 per cent after appearing on the losing side just once during his only season with the Premier League champions. Gerard Pique, who spent four years at Manchester United, makes up the top three after winning 10 of his 12 Premier League games before rejoining Barcelona and going on to win countless trophies, including a World Cup with Spain. Gerard Pique made 12 Premier League appearances for Manchester United, winning 10 of them. Arjen Robben posts an impressive 82.1 per cent win ration in the Premier League from 67 matches. Asier del Horno won 20 times during his only season in the Premier League with Chelsea in 2005-06. Arjen Robben has arguably the most impressive stats of any player on the list for the number of appearances he made for Chelsea during a three-year spell. The Bayern Munich winger was on the winning side an incredible 55 times from his 67 games giving him a win ration of 82.1 per cent. Another former Chelsea player Asier del Horno is fifth on the list with 80 per cent and is followed by current Arsenal right back Hector Bellerin with 78.6. Arsenal right back Hector Bellerin (left) has won 11 of his 14 league games this season. Manchester United forward James Wilson has won 10 of 13 appearances in the league. Igor Stepanov made 17 appearances for Arsenal in the early 2000s and won 13 matches. Manchester United's 19-year-old striker James Wilson has only failed to be on the winning side three times from his 13 appearances putting him seventh on the list, while former Arsenal defender Igor Stepanovs' 76.5 per cent is enough to put him eighth. Nacho Monreal, currently preferred to Kieran Gibbs as Arsenal left back, has won 43 games from his 57 appearances for Arsene Wenger's side. United defender Paddy McNair sneaks into the top 10 with 75 per cent having featured 12 times under Louis van Gaal this season, winning nine. When did Ospina join Arsenal? Arsenal signed Ospina from Ligue 1 side Nice last summer. The 26-year-old made close to 200 appearances for the French club during six seasons. How much did Arsenal pay for him? Originally signed as back-up and competition for Wojciech Szczesny after the Gunners No 2 Lukasz Fabianski joined Swansea, Ospina cost a paltry £3million. Is he of international calibre? Ospina had won 52 caps for Colombia and impressed during their run to the World Cup quarter-final in Brazil last summer. When did Ospina make his first appearance for Arsenal? Ospina made his debut for Arsenal in a 2-1 defeat by Southampton in the third round of the Capital One Cup back in September and only made one further appearance in the Champions League before 2015. When did he displace Wojciech Szczesny as No 1? Ospina was recalled to the starting line-up as Arsenal beat Hull 2-0 in the FA Cup third round in January after Szczesny was at fault for both goals during a 2-0 defeat by Southampton. It later emerged that the Poland goalkeeper was caught smoking in the showers after the game. Ospina kept his place for the league game the following week and has played every Premier League match since. Did you know... Ospina is brother-in-law to Real Madrid midfielder and Colombia team-mate James Rodriguez. The former Monaco star married Ospina's sister Daniela in 2011.

Article: Chelsea's Eden Hazard and Arsenal's Santi Cazorla are set to reach a Premier League milestone this weekend when they each make their 100th appearance. Both players have been hugely influential since they moved to London in the summer of 2012, but who has been the most exciting import to watch? Here, Sportsmail's reporters choose the player they most enjoy seeing in action. Eden Hazard (L) and Santi Cazorla are both set to make their 100th Premier League appearance this weekend. Lee Clayton. Cazorla has wonderful balance. So does Hazard. Cazorla scores important goals. So does Hazard. Cazorla is two-footed. So is Hazard. Cazorla dances past opponents. So does Hazard. So, while there is not a lot to choose between them and Hazard is likely to get the most picks in this article, I am going for Cazorla. It's a personal choice. He is a wonderful footballer. I have paid to watch them both (and I will pay to watch them both again), but the little Spanish magician edges it for me. VERDICT: CAZORLA. Cazorla, pictured in action against Burnley, has been an influential part of Arsenal's midfield this season. Ian Ladyman. I remember when Manchester City baulked at paying Hazard's wages when the Belgian was up for grabs in 2012. Back then City thought the young forward had a rather high opinion of his own worth for a player who was yet to play in a major European league. In the early days of his time at Chelsea, it looked as though City may have been right. He showed flashes of brilliance but also looked rather too easy to push off the ball. Roll forward to 2015, however, and the 24-year-old has developed in to one of the most important players in the Barclays Premier League. Brave, strong and ambitious, Hazard plays on the front foot and with only one thought in this mind. Rather like Cristiano Ronaldo, he has also developed in to the type of player ever defender hates, simply because he gets back up every time he is knocked to the ground. He would get in every team in the Premier League and is one of the reasons Chelsea will win the title this season. VERDICT: HAZARD. Hazard controls the ball under pressure from Stoke midfielder Stephen Ireland at Stamford Bridge. Dominic King. It has to be Hazard. I saw him play for Lille twice in the season before he joined Chelsea – once against St Etienne, the other was what proved to be his final appearance against Nancy. He scored two in the first match, a hat-trick the latter and played a different game to those around him. He hasn't disappointed since arriving here and I love the nonchalance with which he takes a penalty, his low centre of gravity and the way he can bamboozle defenders. If there is such a thing as £32million bargain, it is Hazard. VERDICT: HAZARD. Hazard celebrates after scoring a fine individual goal in Chelsea's 3-2 win against Hull in March. Nick Harris. Now this is a tricky one because while Eden Hazard will frequently embark on a dribble or dink in a pass that will make you nod in appreciation, he'll also miss a penalty and make you groan. Whereas the older Cazorla, less flashy but no less of a technical master, is to my mind more of a fulcrum, more important relatively to the sum of Arsenal's parts than Hazard is to Chelsea. You'll gasp at Hazard but Cazorla's wow factor is richer. That's not to dismiss either: both are brilliant footballers, contributing goals, assists and flair. Any neutral would bite your hand off to have either playing in your team. Forced to pick though, it's Cazorla, for his consistency and crucially doing it in the biggest games. Exhibit A would be Manchester City 0 Arsenal 2 in January; goal, assist, all-round brilliance, against a big team, at an important time. VERDICT: CAZORLA. Cazorla scores from the penalty spot in Arsena's 2-0 away win at Manchester City in January. Riath Al-Samarrai. Eden Hazard for me. Cazorla is an utter delight, a little pinball of a man who is probably the most two-footed player I've seen. Put him in a tight space and then you see what makes him rare among the best. But Hazard is the top player in the Premier League, in my opinion. This is the sixth of his eight seasons as a professional where he has reached double figures and yet he offers so much more than goals (36 in 99 in the Premier League for Chelsea). He can beat a man and, better still, you sense he likes doing it. Technically, his passing and shooting are excellent and he also has a mind capable of sussing out the shapes and systems in front of him. That intelligence, more specifically his speed of thought, is probably what makes separates the good from the brilliant. A complete player who doesn't yet seem to have the complete ego. VERDICT: HAZARD. Hazard gets away from Manchester City duo Fernando (left) and Martin Demichelis at Stamford Bridge. Laurie Whitwell. Has to be Hazard for me. The way he carries the ball through ever tightening spaces and emerges the other side is a joy. Like one of those Indiana Jones impossible escapes from a sliding door or rolling boulder. And his penalties are mesmeric. I could watch them again and again not working out how he does it. VERDICT: HAZARD. Belgium international Hazard scores a header past West Ham goalkeeper Adrian at Upton Park. Sami Mokbel. Both are marvellous players, but I could watch Santi Cazorla all day. When he first arrived in England I remember, whilst sitting in the Upton Park press box, trying to work out whether he was left or right footed. He was wonderful that day as Arsenal cruised to a 3-1 win; it was one of the most complete performances I've seen live. In truth, I've still got no idea whether he's left or right footed. He's that natural on either. Hazard is a phenomenon, but aesthetically no on can touch Cazorla in the Premier League. VERDICT: CAZORLA. Cazorla grins after scoring Arsenal's fourth goal against Aston Villa at the Emirates in February. Jack Gaughan. From a purely artistic sense, Santi Cazorla is probably the most graceful individual on the ball in the entire Premier League. But Eden Hazard provides moments to really stick in the memory. He glides past opponents effortlessly and regularly chips in with important goals - plenty of them stunning in their execution. Worth the ticket alone. The one blot from Cazorla's point of view is that his genius can be fleeting. VERDICT: HAZARD. Sam Cunningham. Jose Mourinho has told him to add more goals to his game to move on a par with Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo and, three years younger than the Argentine and six than the Portuguese, he is not far from doing that. I've watched Hazard countless times at Stamford Bridge this season and he makes the game seem like an art form with his movement, dribbling and passing. Cazorla can excite at times, but he is nowhere near consistently reaching Hazard's level. For me there is no contest between the pair. VERDICT: HAZARD. Hazard tucks home yet another penalty during Chelsea 2-1 win against Stoke City last weekend. Craig Hope. I would far rather have Hazard in my team, but I can't help but feel the excitement has been stripped from him under Jose Mourinho. Efficient, technically brilliant, effective and hard-working he most certainly is - and he will be crowned PFA Player of the Year - but he is no longer the daring dribbler of whom we heard so much about during his teenage years in France. He is, though, arguably a better player for Mourinho's influence. Cazorla, meanwhile, would never thrive under Mourinho, there is too much of Juan Mata about him. But there is no doubt he is thrilling to watch on his day - it's just a shame those days aren't as frequent as they should be for a player of his calibre. VERDICT: HAZARD. RESULT: HAZARD 7-3 CAZORLA. Hazard has been voted as a more exciting player than Cazorla in Sportsmail's survey.

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence.
Chelsea star Eden Hazard is set to make his 100th top-flight appearance. Santi Cazorla should hit the same milestone when Arsenal meet Burnley. Both players have impressed since moving to the Premier League in 2012. Hazard has more goals this season but Cazorla has one more assist. Sportsmail's reporters choose the player who has excited them the most.

Article: A Rajasthan Royals player in India's lucrative domestic cricket league was offered money to influence a game last month but reported the approach to the country's board, the team said on Friday. The player, who was not named, was offered money by a state team mate if he followed a 'pre-decided pattern of play', the Indian Express reported. Confirming the approach, the Rajasthan franchise said the player immediately reported the incident to the Indian cricket board's (BCCI) Anti-Corruption and Security Unit. Action from the 2012 Indian Premier League between Kolkata Knight Riders and Delhi Daredevils. 'Over a month ago, a player from Rajasthan Royals was approached inappropriately by a player (who was not part of the IPL) in connection with the Indian Premier League 2015 matches,' Rajasthan CEO Raghu Iyer said in a statement. 'Rajasthan Royals commends the player for having reported this incident immediately and for his honesty and uprightness. 'His dedication to maintain the highest standards of integrity needs to be lauded.' BCCI secretary Anurag Thakur confirmed that the player had informed the anti-corruption unit about the incident. 'A player was approached and he immediately intimated BCCI anti-corruption unit. Glad that BCCI education policy showing positive results,' Thakur said on Twitter. 'Players are alert and they know what is to be done due to our regular education efforts.' Rajasthan are all too aware about the threat of match-fixing after former India paceman Shanthakumaran Sreesanth and two other cricketers from the team were arrested in 2013 on suspicion of taking money to concede a fixed number of runs. Sreesanth, who denied any wrongdoing, was subsequently banned for life by the BCCI.

Article: (CNN)A Duke student has admitted to hanging a noose made of rope from a tree near a student union, university officials said Thursday. The prestigious private school didn't identify the student, citing federal privacy laws. In a news release, it said the student was no longer on campus and will face student conduct review. The student was identified during an investigation by campus police and the office of student affairs and admitted to placing the noose on the tree early Wednesday, the university said. Officials are still trying to determine if other people were involved. Criminal investigations into the incident are ongoing as well. Students and faculty members marched Wednesday afternoon chanting "We are not afraid. We stand together,"  after pictures of the noose were passed around on social media. At a forum held on the steps of Duke Chapel, close to where the noose was discovered at 2 a.m., hundreds of people gathered. "You came here for the reason that you want to say with me, 'This is no Duke we will accept. This is no Duke we want. This is not the Duke we're here to experience. And this is not the Duke we're here to create,' " Duke President Richard Brodhead told the crowd. The incident is one of several recent racist events to affect college students. Last month a fraternity at the University of Oklahoma had its charter removed after a video surfaced showing members using the N-word and referring to lynching in a chant. Two students were expelled. In February, a noose was hung around the neck of a statue of a famous civil rights figure at the University of Mississippi. A statement issued by Duke said there was a previous report of hate speech directed at students on campus. In the news release, the vice president for student affairs called the noose incident a "cowardly act." "To whomever committed this hateful and stupid act, I just want to say that if your intent was to create fear, it will have the opposite effect," Larry Moneta said Wednesday. Duke University is a private college with about 15,000 students in Durham, North Carolina. CNN's Dave Alsup contributed to this report.

Article: Andre Ayew is keen on a move to Liverpool this summer. The Ghana international will be a free agent as he is out of contract at Marseille and wants to join the Anfield club who he supported as a boy. Everton, Newcastle and Swansea have all shown interest while Ayew's representatives have held talks with Roma. Wolfsburg, Borussia Dortmund and Napoli are also keen to speak to him. Ayew, 25, was born in France but followed his father Abedi Pele by playing for Ghana where he has become one of their star performers notably scoring in the World Cup finals last summer against USA and eventual winners Germany. Andre Ayew is out of contract at Marseille in the summer and is keen on a move to England. The Ghana international admits he supported Liverpool as a boy and would like to play for the Anfield club. Although emotionally attached to Marseille, he admits he is seeking a new challenge and is ready to test himself in the Premier League. Talking to Sportsmail, he said: 'I'm a Marseille boy, I love Marseille, the club, the fans, the area, it's a great place to play football and I will continue to speak to them but it's true I'd like to play in England.' Ayew, who is represented in England by agent Mark McKay of ExcelFoot, added: 'I grew up watching English football and I support Liverpool. Steven Gerrard is my favourite player. They have always had exciting teams and now they are a club that likes to play with pace and give chances to young players. Ayew's favourite player growing up was Steven Gerrard, who will leave Liverpool at the end of the season. A player he knew from their time together at Marseille, Ayew speaks regularly to Joey Barton (right) 'I'm 25 now and it is a good age for me to take the next step in my career. I have offers from England, Italy and Germany but it would be unfair to say who from. I speak to my friends such as Morgan Amalfitano at West Ham and Joey Barton at QPR and they always talk well about the league and the atmosphere. 'I have been fortunate to experience Stamford Bridge and Old Trafford in the Champions League but I want to play at Anfield and other grounds. 'I know my quality. I have shown I can play at Marseille and I have taken on responsibility with my country. It's important that you always strive to be better. You see with players such as Eden Hazard how hard they work and I believe in hard work to get better. It's easy to talk though, what is important is that I do it.' The Ghana international is also being looked at by Swansea, Newcastle and Everton in the Premier League. Liverpool have already secured the signing of Divock Origi (left), who will move to Anfield in the summer. Ayew's ideal is to help Marseille win the French league but it will be difficult as they trail leaders Paris Saint-Germain by five points. 'I will fight to the end for Marseille then I will make my decision. It is an important step for me.' Liverpool already have Divock Origi in the bag and are keen on Burnley's Danny Ings but will be enthused that a player of Ayew's pedigree has such desire to play for them. Failure to reach the Champions League could also mean he falls within their budget as a free transfer. Brendan Rodgers wants a goalkeeper, midfielder and a full-back as well as a forward. He likes Memphis Depay at PSV Eindhoven but the Holland international is expected to join Manchester United.

Article: Daniel Ricciardo has called for a back-to-basics approach for Red Bull to forge a return to the front of the grid. Second best to Mercedes last season after a run of four successive championship triumphs, Red Bull have struggled at the start of this year. To rub salt into the wounds, Red Bull even found themselves trailing'sister' team Toro Rosso at the last race in Malaysia. Daniel Ricciardo in action during practice for this weekend's Chinese Grand Prix. The Australian driver has urged his Red Bull team to go back to basics after a troubled start to 2015. The main gripe has centred on power-unit supplier Renault, with billionaire benefactor Dietrich Mateschitz suggesting this week he could pull his team out of the sport if matters fail to improve. Ahead of this weekend's grand prix in China, Ricciardo concedes Red Bull are exploring numerous avenues to correct the problems. The Australian managed to finish third quickest in practice, a second behind reigning champion Lewis Hamilton in his Mercedes and four tenths of a second adrift of Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen. 1. Lewis Hamilton Mercedes 1:37.219. 2. Kimi Raikkonen Ferrari 1:37.662. 3. Daniel Ricciardo Red Bull - Renault 1:38.311. 4. Sebastian Vettel Ferrari 1:38.339. 5. Nico Rosberg Mercedes 1:38.399. 6. Daniil Kvyat Red Bull - Renault 1:38.737. 7. Valtteri Bottas Williams-Mercedes 1:38.850. 8. Felipe Nasr Sauber - Ferrari 1:39.032. 9. Romain Grosjean Lotus - Mercedes 1:39.142. 10. Jenson Button  McLaren 1:39.275. 11. Pastor Maldonado  Lotus - Mercedes 1:39.444. 12. Fernando Alonso  McLaren 1:39.743. 13. Marcus Ericsson Sauber - Ferrari 1:39.751. 14. Max Verstappen Toro Rosso - Renault 1:39.894. 15. Carlos Sainz Jr Toro Rosso - Renault 1:39.971. 16. Nico Hulkenberg  Force India - Mercedes 1:40.151. 17. Felipe Massa Williams-Mercedes 1:40.423. 18. Sergio Perez Force India - Mercedes 1:40.868. 19. Roberto Merhi  Marussia - Ferrari 1:42.973. 20. Will Stevens  Marussia - Ferrari 1:44.564. 'We are experimenting with a few things, but I think for now we have to go back to what we know, get our basics right,' said Ricciardo. 'We have done quite a bit. In Malaysia we had brake issues, a lot of overheating, so we have reverted back on a few things, even from last year which we knew was more efficient. 'Just because it's from last year it doesn't mean it's not better, so I guess we have taken a step back in that direction. The team has done quite a lot to rectify some issues and get us further up the grid.' Ricciardo has no doubt Renault are also pulling their weight, adding: 'From Melbourne to Malaysia they made a pretty massive step with driveability. 'We also have a few more software things this weekend, which should give things another pretty significant step on that side. 'I appreciate what everyone is doing to get us back towards the front, so fingers crossed it can be put together in the right way this weekend and if so we can get back into that top five.' Daniil Kvyat was forced to pull off track 19 minutes from the end of FP2 after his brakes caught fire. Team-mate Daniil Kvyat, however, was not so fortunate as the young Russian was forced to pull off track 19 minutes from the end of FP2 after his brakes caught fire. Christian Horner said: 'Something overheated within the rear hub assembly. As a result of that we lost pressure in the master cylinder halfway round the lap. 'We asked him to drive back slowly without using the brakes if at all possible, but unfortunately he had to brake at turn 14 and he had a very slow off. 'It's frustrating it's happened, but all the relevant pieces are intact so we can find out what the root cause was.' Despite suffering brake issues in Malaysia, Horner insists the issue there and the one experienced by Kvyat are 'totally unrelated'. Horner added: 'Today was a one-off and can be sorted for tomorrow.'

Red Bull have endured a difficult start to the new Formula One campaign. Daniel Ricciardo was third quickest during practice for the Chinese GP. The Australian's Red Bull team-mate Daniil Kvyat was sixth fastest. But his brakes caught fire and he was forced to stop on track.

Article: Mario Balotelli hit back at those criticising his absence for Liverpool's FA Cup quarter-final win over Blackburn Rovers due to illness by attempting to prove he had a high temperature. Robbie Savage branded Balotelli 'pathetic' for missing the game, four days after he withdrew himself from the Liverpool squad  for their trip to Arsenal following a'slight knock' suffered in training. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers revealed the £16million striker travelled with the squad to Blackburn, but that he felt too ill to take part after staying over in the hotel with his team-mates. Mario Balotelli responded to Robbie Savage's labelling of the Liverpool striker as 'pathetic' Balotelli was not included in the Liverpool squad to face Arsenal or Blackburn Rovers this week. Brendan Rodgers revealed Balotelli withdrew himself from the squad on Saturday and fell ill on Wednesday. Liverpool scraped through to a Wembley date with Aston Villa in the FA Cup semi-finals thanks to Philippe Coutinho's strike. With 20 minutes remaining at Ewood Park, the Brazilian fired the ball across goal and past Rovers keeper Simon Eastwood. Click here to read Ian Ladyman's report. BT Sport pundit and former Blackburn midfielder Savage said: 'Pathetic isn't it? You're going to miss an FA Cup quarter-final? 'I don't know how unwell he is, but to miss an FA Cup quarter-final when you're feeling a bit ill? Nonsense. I would have to be really, really ill to miss that game.' Balotelli responded by posting a photograph of himself on Instagram, holding a thermometer reading 38.7 Celsius — 1.7C above 'normal' body temperature. Philippe Coutinho fires home the winner to send Liverpool into the FA Cup semi-final against Reading. Coutinho celebrates with his team-mates as Liverpool keep their dreams of winning a trophy alive. Mario Balotelli reported a temperature of 38.7C (101.66F) which is indeed above the normal body temperature of 37C (99.5F). The Liverpool striker may also have felt hot, sweaty, thirsty, very uncomfortable and slightly hungry. He may also have felt tired. Should body temperature reach 40C (104F), the person will be dehydrated and may suffer from vomiting and dizziness. With the snap, Balotelli wrote: 'Nothing stop me to watch my team winning. At least this time you know the real reason I am out. Miss the pitch so much #unluckyseason #YNWA #illbeback [sic].' Rodgers planned to use Balotelli for the FA Cup tie, but  admitted it was at the final moment his misfiring striker became unavailable. 'Mario travelled with us. He trained well, [but] fell ill last night,' Rodgers said ahead of the match which ended 1-0 to Liverpool. 'He stayed overnight with us in the hotel, [but] woke up still not feeling great. The doctors' advice was to send him back.' Balotelli's absence follows the Italian missing last Saturday's 4-1 defeat by Arsenal. The striker did not travel to the Emirates for the crunch clash after sustaining a hamstring injury in training on Friday. Rodgers said at the time: 'He trained on Friday afternoon with the team and he took a slight knock to his knee and he deemed himself not able to travel. 'I'm not a medic. He felt it was too sore to travel. The medical staff have looked at it. It was just something that he himself didn't feel comfortable enough to travel.' But Balotelli was reportedly later spotted with a group of friends at a private table at Manchester nightclub One Central Street. BT Sport pundit Savage feels it shows Balotelli's lack of determination to be absent for the FA Cup tie.

Article: (CNN)He's a blue chip college basketball recruit. She's a high school freshman with Down syndrome. At first glance Trey Moses and Ellie Meredith couldn't be more different. But all that changed Thursday when Trey asked Ellie to be his prom date. Trey -- a star on Eastern High School's basketball team in Louisville, Kentucky, who's headed to play college ball next year at Ball State -- was originally going to take his girlfriend to Eastern's prom. So why is he taking Ellie instead? "She's great... she listens and she's easy to talk to" he said. Trey made the prom-posal (yes, that's what they are calling invites to prom these days) in the gym during Ellie's P.E. class. Trina Helson, a teacher at Eastern, alerted the school's newspaper staff to the prom-posal and posted photos of Trey and Ellie on Twitter that have gone viral. She wasn't surpristed by Trey's actions. "That's the kind of person Trey is," she said. To help make sure she said yes, Trey entered the gym armed with flowers and a poster that read "Let's Party Like it's 1989," a reference to the latest album by Taylor Swift, Ellie's favorite singer. Trey also got the OK from Ellie's parents the night before via text. They were thrilled. "You just feel numb to those moments raising a special needs child,"  said Darla Meredith, Ellie's mom. "You first feel the need to protect and then to overprotect." Darla Meredith said Ellie has struggled with friendships since elementary school, but a special program at Eastern called Best Buddies had made things easier for her. She said Best Buddies cultivates friendships between students with and without developmental disabilities and prevents students like Ellie from feeling isolated and left out of social functions. "I guess around middle school is when kids started to care about what others thought," she said, but "this school, this year has been a relief." Trey's future coach at Ball State, James Whitford, said he felt great about the prom-posal, noting that Trey, whom he's known for a long time, often works with other kids. Trey's mother, Shelly Moses, was also proud of her son. "It's exciting to bring awareness to a good cause," she said. "Trey has worked pretty hard, and he's a good son." Both Trey and Ellie have a lot of planning to do. Trey is looking to take up special education as a college major, in addition to playing basketball in the fall. As for Ellie, she can't stop thinking about prom. "Ellie can't wait to go dress shopping" her mother said. "Because I've only told about a million people!" Ellie interjected.

Article: These are the horrific final moments of a 44-year-old suspect who was apparently accidentally shot dead by a 73-year-old reserve deputy last week after he fired his handgun instead of his Taser. In the footage, released by police, deputies are filmed chasing after Eric Harris, first by car then on foot, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on April 2 after he fled during a sting operation in a nearby parking lot. Once they catch up to Harris, they tackle him to the ground and order him to lie on his stomach. Robert Bates then yells, 'Taser! Taser!' - but takes out his service weapon and pulls the trigger. After firing one round into Harris, the former full-time officer drops his gun from the recoil and says in shock: 'Oh, I shot him! I'm sorry.' Harris then starts yelping on the ground, while pleading for help. WARNING: GRAPHIC VIDEO. Chase: This newly-released video of Eric Harris's fatal shooting shows deputies chasing after Harris, first by car then on foot, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on April 2 after he fled during a sting operation in a nearby parking lot. Fleeing: The deputies run after Harris, who was allegedly caught trying to buy drugs and a gun from cops. View from the ground: Once they catch up to Harris, they tackle him to the ground and order him to lie on his stomach. Robert Bates then yells, 'Taser! Taser!' (pictured) - but takes out his handgun and pulls the trigger. The fatally-wounded man, who is being held down by his neck by the deputies, exclaims: 'Oh my god, he shot me! He shot me! He shot me, man.' He then adds: 'Oh, my god. I'm losing my breath.' Shockingly, one of the deputies replies: 'F*** your breath.' Another calls Harris, who is black and dressed in shorts and a T-shirt, a'motherf***er' and tells him: 'You shouldn't have f***ing ran.' Following the incident, during which the deputies do not appear to realize Harris has been fatally injured and even tell him to'shut the f*** up', the suspect was hospitalized. He died an hour later. The footage, obtained by NewsOn6, comes as a number of US shootings  involving police officers and  black suspects have hit the headlines. Many of the suspects were unarmed at the time. In the April 2 incident, Bates accidentally fired his gun thinking that he had pulled out his Taser - as proved by the fact he did not expect the weapon to recoil, the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office said. Bates, who had been monitoring the situation from afar, ran up to Harris in a bid 'to get the situation under control', before mistakenly firing his gun instead of his Taser, according to on-site deputies. Apology: After firing one round into Harris, the former full-time officer drops his gun from the recoil and says in shock: 'Oh, I shot him! I'm sorry' (pictured) Harris then starts yelping on the ground, while shouting, 'Help!' Shooting: This photo shows a deputy bending down to pick up Bates's dropped gun following the 'accidental' shooting in Tulsa earlier this month. Harris is being held down on the ground, out of shot, by other deputies. Terrified: The fatally-wounded man, who is being held by his neck and back by the deputies (pictured), says: 'Oh my god, he shot me! He shot me! He shot me, man.' He then adds: 'Oh, my god. I'm losing my breath' Suspect: Shockingly, one of the deputies replies: 'F*** your breath.' Another calls Harris (pictured in a police mug shot released d by officials on April 4) a'motherf***er' and tells him: 'You shouldn't have f***ing ran' Harris, who was being restrained at the time, had  allegedly fled after he was caught trying to buy drugs and a gun from deputies posing as dealers in the parking lot of a nearby dollar store. Major Shannon Clark told CNN: 'They were struggling trying to get him into custody, he ran up trying to use a less lethal device, trying to get the situation under control. 'Inadvertently he discharged a round from his service weapon.' He added: 'Did an accident happen? Sure. But is it accredited to his age? Or was it accredited to the rapidly evolving situation? I guess that will be determined in the investigation.' Bates, who has been a reserve since 2008, is the chief executive of Robert C Bates LLC, a Tulsa-based insurance company, who worked as an officer assigned to the Violent Crimes Task Force. Fatal: Following the incident, during which the deputies told Harris to'shut the f*** up', the suspect was hospitalized. He died an hour later. Above, blood appears to be running down Harris's arm at the scene. Scene: In this photo, which has been partially blanked out by the Sheriff's Office, deputies are pictured at the scene of the incident. The deputy in the foreground of the frame is holding down Harris following the shooting. He has also spent time with the Tulsa Police Auxiliary. Speaking to local site News OK, Bates said: 'It was me. My attorney has advised me not to comment. As much as I would like to, I can’t.' According to Tulsa Police, Harris had met an undercover officer to sell him a 9 mm semi-automatic pistol and 300 rounds ammunition. He fled the scene when deputies tried to arrest him, it is alleged. The suspect then fought with another deputy when he was shot, police said. He was gunned down accidentally by Bates after officers 'observed him reaching for his waistband area... causing concern for the deputies' safety,' authorities told CNN. Officers had been monitoring Harris as part of an investigation into the trade of methamphetamine. As he met with undercover deputies to allegedly hand over the drugs, he is accused of offering to throw in a sawed-off gun. Confusion: Bates, 73, accidentally grabbed his pistol and shot Harris (right, in a previous mug shot) dead, according to Tulsa police. Bates is classified as an advanced deputy. The incident is now under investigation. His convictions include escaping prison in 1990, robbery with a dangerous weapon in 1999, and making threatening phone calls. According to Tulsa Police, Harris' killer, Bates, is classified as an advanced deputy. Reserves are 'basic', 'intermediate', or 'advanced'. The qualify for 'advanced', officers are required to have a minimum of 320 hours of training and 25 hours of training a year. During the annual field training program, they are tested on how to use and identify lethal and non-lethal weapons. With the same power as paid deputies, reserves can conduct their own investigations, make arrests and work on task forces. The cause of Harris's death is under investigation.

Article: John Carver is threatening changes when Newcastle face Liverpool on Monday night as he admits concerns remain over the character of his players. It is no secret United are planning a major overhaul of their squad this summer and 'personality' will rank high when it comes to identifying transfer targets. The trip to Anfield is Newcastle's first outing since losing a fifth straight Tyne-Wear derby and they have now won just twice in 2015. John Carver says his Newcastle players have a point to prove when they face Liverpool on Monday. Newcastle in training earlier this week for their game against Liverpool on Monday in the Premier League. Moussa Sissoko (left), Vurnon Anita (centre) and Massadio Haidara (right) take a break during the session. And Carver said: 'Maybe I need to change the team and hope that sparks something. 'We are going to need characters and I want to see some energy. I didn't see energy last weekend. We talked about out-working the opposition but they out-worked us again. 'So there's something not right within their DNA when it comes to a derby game. 'There's something not right within their make-up. No matter how hard you try and no matter what you try and do, it's an issue.' Carver has now seen his Newcastle team lose four in a row and fall into relegation danger. Newcastle were beaten in last weekend's Tyne/Wear derby by Jermain Defoe's stunning volley. That being the case, Carver says close-season recruitment will focus on mental attributes as much as physical. 'You've got to try and do as much homework as you can to find out about their personality,' he said. 'But with the amount of foreign players coming in now it's a tougher situation. 'I've done this in the past when I've gone to watch a player and sat with their fans. You can actually start having a conversation about them and try to find out a little bit about their character. What's he like? Does he get many red cards? Is he aggressive? Has he got a bit of a problem socially? All those little things help to build a bigger picture. 'But for now it is about finishing our season with pride and the players proving a point to themselves, because some of them are playing for their future.'

Newcastle have lost their last four Premier League games. John Carver's side lost 1-0 to Sunderland in the Tyne-Wear derby. The Magpies have won just twice in 2015 ahead of their Anfield trip.

Article: Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has confessed his academy players are not ready to step into his first-team squad, hinting that City may look to cherry-pick the best youngsters from their top-flight rivals. In the week that Liverpool’s Raheem Sterling spoke about his unwillingness to agree a new contract at Anfield, Pellegrini’s comments suggest that City may look to invest heavily in other teams’ homegrown talent this summer. Premier League regulations require clubs to carry at least eight homegrown players, which can include youngsters who have spent three of their formative years at an English club. FA chairman Greg Dyke is pushing for the figure to be raised to 12. Manuel Pellegrini says the academy players at Manchester City are not ready for the first team. Pellegrini's assertions may mean City buy English players like Raheem Sterling to reach homegrown quotas. Everton's England international midfield player Ross Barkley has also been linked with City. But the lack of suitable candidates emerging from Patrick Vieira’s academy means City’s only option will be to buy in the bulk of their quota, with the defending league champions also linked with Arsenal’s Jack Wilshere and Ross Barkley of Everton. City’s current group of home-grown players will be reduced in the summer when Frank Lampard departs and it could be further depleted if James Milner, who wants guarantees of more regular first-team football, opts to leave. Coincidentally, Liverpool is Milner’s most likely destination should he leave but the prospect of Sterling moving in the opposite direction has been increased to the point that bookmakers rate City his most likely destination next season. City’s youth system has come under fire in recent seasons for its lack of productivity. Belgian defender Dedryck Boyata, who has started nine league games in nearly six years at City, is the only former academy player anywhere near first-team contention. Pellegrini said: ‘We must be patient with the academy. Young players are important. Maybe it’s not so easy for young players, especially at big clubs, to play in the first team, with the professional squad. But I’m sure in the future we will have very important players coming from the academy. James Milner could leave City in the summer with Liverpool a potential destination. Arsenal midfield player Jack Wilshere has also been linked with a transfer to City. Defender Dedryck Boyata (right) is City's only academy player near first-team contention. ‘But it’s important to have years of working the same way. But you never know. Maybe some talented young players can do it soon.’ Sterling would fit the bill, if his impasse at Liverpool proves unsolvable, although Pellegrini refused to comment directly about the Liverpool and England forward. Pellegrini said: ‘I think it’s important for big clubs to bring in the best players, that’s the most important thing. If they’re all good players, of course I agree with the quota. All the big leagues — especially the Premier League — need the best players to play.’ City’s homegrown quota is made up of Boyata, Lampard, Milner, Joe Hart, reserve keeper Richard Wright and Gael Clichy, who qualifies from his years spent with Arsenal. They are joined by four academy players — Thierry Ambrose, George Glendon, Jose Angel Tasende and Jose Angel Pozo, although Spaniard Pozo is the only one to have been near the first team this season. A number of young City professionals, including John Guidetti at Celtic, PSV’s Karim Rekik and Marcos Lopes with Lille, are on loan and may be brought back to plug some of the holes next season, although a big investment in English talent via the transfer market seems the only option. Frank Lampard helps make up City's homegrown quota but is leaving for New York at the end of the season. Patrick Vieira is overseeing the City academy's production of youth and homegrown players. Striker John Guidetti is on loan at Celtic but could return to meet quota regulations next season. Meanwhile, Pellegrini is not in action until Monday, when he takes his team to Crystal Palace, and with Chelsea in an apparently commanding lead at the top, the City manager admits his side face eight cup finals. He said: ‘I hope we can do it. We have to play eight finals from now until the end. We will see the way we play. I hope the way we finish against West Brom is the way we must continue. ‘It is not easy to make a clear analysis because they play with one player less. I hope in these eight games we continue playing that way.’

Manuel Pellegrini believes his youth players are not ready for the first-team. His homegrown quote will be depleted when Frank Lamapard leaves. Pellegrini may lose James Milner, forcing him to invest in home talent.

Article: (CNN)Governments around the world are using the threat of terrorism -- real or perceived -- to advance executions, Amnesty International alleges in its annual report on the death penalty. "The dark trend of governments using the death penalty in a futile attempt to tackle real or imaginary threats to state security and public safety was stark last year," said Salil Shetty, Amnesty's Secretary General in a release. "It is shameful that so many states around the world are essentially playing with people's lives -- putting people to death for 'terrorism' or to quell internal instability on the ill-conceived premise of deterrence." The report, "Death Sentences and Executions 2014," cites the example of Pakistan lifting a six-year moratorium on the execution of civilians following the horrific attack on a school in Peshawar in December. China is also mentioned, as having used the death penalty as a tool in its "Strike Hard" campaign against terrorism in the restive far-western province of Xinjiang. The annual report catalogs the use of state-sanctioned killing as a punitive measure across the globe, and this year's edition contains some mixed findings. On one hand, the number of executions worldwide has gone down by almost 22% on the previous year. At least 607 people were executed around the world in 2014, compared to 778 in 2013. Amnesty's figures do not include statistics on executions carried out in China, where information on the practice is regarded as a state secret. Belarus and Vietnam, too, do not release data on death penalty cases. "The long-term trend is definitely positive -- we are seeing a decrease in the number of executions (worldwide)," Audrey Gaughran, Amnesty's Director of Global Issues, told CNN. "A number of countries are closer to abolition, and there are some signs that some countries will be abolitionist by 2015. (There are) signals of a world that is nearing abolition." While the report notes some encouraging signs, it also highlights a marked increase in the number of people sentenced to death in 2014. At least 2,466 people globally are confirmed to have been handed the sentence last year, an increase of 28% compared with 2013. The report notes that the spike in sentencing is attributable to mass-sentencing in countries including Egypt and Nigeria, "against scores of people in some cases." The organization found "positive developments" worldwide, with most regions seeming to show reductions in the number of executions. Opinion: Sharp spike in death sentences. Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, saw a 28% fall in reported cases, and executions recorded in the Middle East and North Africa were down 23% compared to 2013. "Even though we've highlighted some of the negative developments... I think we would always highlight that there are positive developments," Gaughran said. "Across the board, with the exception of Europe and Central Asia there were fewer reports of executions in every region." The resumption of the use of capital punishment in Belarus -- the only country in Europe and Central Asia to execute people -- after a two year hiatus spoiled an near-universal decrease in countries using the death penalty by region. The United States has the dubious distinction of being the only country in the Americas to conduct executions, but the number of convicts put to death here fell slightly, from 39 in 2013 to 35 in 2014. The state of Washington also imposed a moratorium on executions last year. The U.S. remains one of the worst offenders for imposing capital punishment, with only Iran (289+), Iraq (61+), and Saudi Arabia (90+) executing more people in 2014. While figures are not available, Amnesty estimates that China also executes "thousands" of prisoners each year, "more than the rest of the world put together." The report also highlights the imperfections in the judiciary processes that lead to many sentenced to death. "In the majority of countries where people were sentenced to death or executed, the death penalty was imposed after proceedings that did not meet international fair trial standards," the report stated. "In 2014 Amnesty International raised particular concerns in relation to court proceedings in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, China, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Sri Lanka." The United Nations Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, last year stressed the need to move toward abolition of capital punishment. "The taking of life is too irreversible for one human being to inflict it on another," he said, in marking World Day against Death Penalty in October. "We must continue to argue strongly that the death penalty is unjust and incompatible with fundamental human rights." Amnesty estimates that at least 19,094 people were believed to be on death row at the end of 2014.

Article: She captured hearts across the nation as she realized her dream to play for Mount St. Joseph's women's basketball team in Ohio and raised $1.5million - all while battling inoperable brain cancer. And one of the millions Lauren Hill touched was LeBron James, who posted an emotional farewell letter to the teenager via Twitter on Friday, just hours after she passed away from her rare tumor. In the letter, the basketball star, dubbed King James, praised the 19-year-old for the 'leadership', 'courage' and'strength' she had shown while suffering from Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG). James, 30, who had never actually met Lauren, wrote: 'Dear Lauren Hill, You are the true definition of strength, courage, power, leadership, etc etc! Your time spent on earth will never be forgotten.

The Cleveland Cavaliers player signed off the letter - which was posted to his Twitter page - 'Sincerely, LeBron James'. The letter has since been retweeted tens of thousands of times. Many users have deemed the tribute 'touching' and 'beautiful'. One told James - who competed against the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday night - that it 'was so sweet it brought me to tears'. Lauren, who was diagnosed with a rare form of brain cancer shortly after her 18th birthday, had repeatedly defied doctors' expectations after they told her that she would not live past December. A touching tribute: James told Lauren not to have 'too much fun up there without all your family and friends' 'Tell my Grandma I said hello': He added that he had spoken 'plenty of times' about Lauren to his grandmother. #RIPLaurenHill: The Cleveland Cavaliers player signed off the letter - which was posted to his Twitter page - 'Sincerely, LeBron James' (pictured). The letter has since been retweeted tens of thousands of times. Instead, the Indiana native played four games with her team at Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati, and raised more than $1.5 million for research into the cancer she suffered from. But as her condition worsened, the teenager became an honorary coach and earlier this year, she moved to Cincinnati Children's Hospital. She passed away at the hospital on Friday morning. As news of her death became public, thousands of people across the country - both basketball fans and not - took to social media to express their sorrow at her death, and show support for her family. Only a year and a half ago, Lauren, whose cancer saw her rapidly gain weight, had been just another teenager preparing for college after deciding to play basketball for Mount St. Joseph. But a few weeks later, she started feeling dizzy while playing for her high school team in nearby Lawrenceburg, Indiana. Tests found her tumor and she was told she had less than two years left. Diagnosis: Lauren is pictured left in December 2013, and right, in December 2014, after her treatment for Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG), a rare childhood brain cancer which changed her appearance. Brave: Lauren, who used her limited energy to inspire people and raise money for research into the cancer that ultimately took her life, is pictured in her room in Cincinnati last December - months before she passed away. In September, doctors gave her the devastating news she wouldn't make it past December - and after years as a standout player, Lauren's hopes of playing college basketball were put in jeopardy. However, the NCAA granted permission to move the school's opening game forward because of her worsening condition. On November 2, Lauren realized her dream of playing for the school. Incredibly, she scored the first and last baskets of the team's 66-55 victory over Hiram College. Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a type of brain tumor found in the part of the brainstem at the lower back of the brain. Due to the tumor's location, it can cause double vision, difficulty controlling eye movement and facial expressions, and difficulty swallowing and chewing. It may also cause weakness in the limbs. The condition primarily affects children most often between the ages of four and nine. Between 100 and 150 new diagnoses are made a year in the U.S. Only 300 are made across North America and Europe a year. It can be treated with radiation, but chemotherapy is generally not effective and surgery is impossible due to the spread of the cancer into healthy tissue. Unlike with other childhood cancers, there has been little progress in improving treatments and cure rates for the condition over the last few decades. Fewer than 10 per cent of children with DIPG survive two years after their diagnosis. Source: DIPG Registry. 'It's a dream come true,' Lauren told reporters at the time. 'To play on a college court, to put my foot down on the floor and hear the roar of the crowd - I just love it so much. I love basketball. 'Everything that happened today was amazing. I'm truly happy, it's a really good day.' At the game, Lauren said she wanted to find a cure for the rare cancer, which has a less than 10 per cent survival rate and most often affects children aged four to nine. 'When I was diagnosed I remember kind of feeling lonely because nobody understood,' she said following the game, USA Today reported. 'And now that more people know about this story and the awareness of DIPG. 'I'm so happy that people know about it now and that we can get some research going and hopefully find that home run cure for cancer. And even though I'm probably not going to be around to see it, it's going to help a lot of people.' Lauren played in four games and made five layups before the spreading tumor made her stop. When the season ended, her team held its annual dinner in the hospital where Hill was being treated. She was also honored at local sporting events and was featured on a box of Wheaties - known as the Breakfast of Champions. The U.S. Basketball Writers Association voted her the Pat Summitt Most Courageous Award, which is normally awarded at the Final Four. Athletes from other colleges autographed No. 22 jerseys - her number - and sent them in support. As the cancer slowed her down, Lauren's family, friends and teammates took a bigger role in promoting her fundraising campaign - and she kept reminding everyone to appreciate life. 'Life is precious,' she told WKRC-TV before her death. 'Every moment you get with someone is a moment that's blessed, really blessed.' Final days: Lauren is pictured enjoying Easter (left) and St Patrick's Day (right) from hospital in Cincinnati. Fighter: The NCAA moved Mount St. Joseph's first basketball game forward last November (pictured) so that Lauren could achieve her dream of playing for collegiate basketball. She scored the first and last baskets. The co-founder of her nonprofit foundation confirmed Lauren's death in hospital on Friday. 'Through Lauren's fundraising and advocacy efforts, she not only became a spotlight on the lack of funding for cancer research, but she most certainly has become a beacon guiding researchers for years to come,' The Cure Starts Now co-founder Brooke Desserich said. Her nonprofit foundation helped to raise more than $1.5 million for cancer research. 'She's made an impact on the world, more so than me - more than I ever will do,' Lauren's coach Dan Benjamin said. 'I've gotten so many emails and phone calls from all over the world. People are contacting me because they want to share her story.' No information about a memorial has yet been released, but Lawrenceburg Schools superintendent Karl Galey said on Twitter that schools will be prepared to assist staff and students with counseling. Heroic: Lauren, pictured left, smiles at Pat Summitt after receiving the Pat Summitt Award during halftime of her first NCAA college basketball game in November last year. She went on to play four games for the school. Dear Lauren Hill,. You are the true definition of strength, courage, power, leadership, etc etc! Your time spent on earth will never be forgotten. I [hate] that I never got the chance to meet u in person but know you inspired me the whole time! For every life u touched, u made the biggest impact [on] them by just being YOU!!

Article: (CNN)Andrew Getty, one of the heirs to billions of oil money, appears to have died of natural causes, a Los Angeles Police Department spokesman said. The coroner's preliminary assessment is there was no foul play involved in the death of Getty, grandson of oil tycoon J. Paul Getty, said Detective Meghan Aguilar. Andrew Getty, 47, had "several health issues," Aguilar said, adding that an autopsy will be conducted. There is no criminal investigation underway, he said. Some medication had also been recovered from Getty's home, though investigators don't know whether Getty was taking it or what his medical history was, Ed Winter, assistant chief in the Los Angeles County coroner's office, told CNN affiliate KTLA Tuesday night. KTLA reported that Getty was found on his side near a bathroom in his home. Getty's parents, Ann and Gordon Getty, released a statement confirming their son's death and asking for privacy. Where the Getty family fortune came from. Gordon Getty is one of three living sons of J. Paul Getty, the oil baron who was thought to be the richest man in the world at the time of his death in 1976. Gordon Getty, 81, has a net worth of $2.1 billion, according to Forbes. One other son died in 1958 and another died in 1973. Gordon Getty spearheaded the controversial sale of Getty to Texaco for $10 billion in 1984. In its list of richest American families, Forbes estimated the Gettys' net worth to be about $5 billion.

In his request, Getty said he had been diagnosed with a serious medical condition in 2013. "A rise in my blood pressure places me in grave risk of substantial and irreparable injury or death," he wrote in the petition. "My doctors have advised that heated arguments can cause my blood pressure to rise dangerously." Andrew Getty had three brothers and three half-sisters. People we've lost in 2015.

Article: Tony Pulis has discussed pre-season plans with Saido Berahino in an indication he plans to keep the striker beyond the summer transfer window. Berahino is likely to be away with Gareth Southgate’s England under 21 side in the Czech Republic until late June so Pulis has begun his preparations early. West Bromwich Albion were open to bids of £20million for Berahino in January and the 21-year-old has said he would leave to fulfil his desire to play in Champions League football. West Brom manager Tony Pulis has talked pre-season plans with Saido Berahino in an indication the England under 21 striker will remain at The Hawthorns beyond the summer. Berahino has been linked with a move away from West Brom after saying he wants to play European football. Pulis said: ‘Hopefully he's away with the under 21s so I have had a chat with him about pre-season and the time he'll have off but I haven't spoken about anything else to him. ‘I think the kid is happy here, he has played that way and certainly worked that way. We're more than happy to have him here because he has been very good.’ Berahino shares the same agent as Raheem Sterling, Aidy Ward, who was criticised by Brendan Rodgers over the Liverpool player’s contract stand-off. Pulis said: ‘Agents can have a massive influence on players in lots of respects. My argument to that is in the same in life, you get good agents and you get bad agents. Berahino is likely to be included in the England under 21 squad for this summer's European Championships. Berahino scored a vital goal in England's under 21 play-off with Croatia back in October. 'Professional footballers have been given a gift and they have a lifespan of about 10-12 years. We should never forget that. To be the best is what they should be aiming for. ‘If I had an agent I'd just say, 'Look after the money, make sure when I finish this job I have enough to look after my family'. I wouldn't be talking to my agent about football.’ Pulis added: ‘I can’t speak for Sterling and I can't speak for the agent as I haven't dealt with that but the one thing I have said about Saido, he has been fantastic here. ‘There's been a real change in his attitude, his commitment to everything we've tried to do has been brilliant.’

Article: They say you should never forget your roots. Even more so in the case of this striking tree spotted in southern China. The banyan tree in Guangxi province does not stand on a single trunk, but a whole web of roots. It has captured the attention of locals, who say they have watched the whole thing sway in the wind due to its flimsy structure, reported the People's Daily Online. Scroll down for video. Fairy tale: The Banyan looks like enchanted trees found in children’s books. Uprooted: The original tree roots grew up against a wall, before it was moved to a nearby park. Originally the roots of the tree grew up against a wall, but when the wall was demolished the tree was carefully uprooted to its new location Northern Gulf Marine and Cultural Park in Fangchenggang city. The roots then became the trunk of the tree, leading to its strange appearance. These photos show how the entangled trunks look like something straight out of the Enchanted Forest. It is truly remarkable that the web of overlapping roots can support the weight of the tree above. Banyan trees are found in hot climates and known for their extensive roots. Sometimes the roots grow so out of control that they eventually engulf the tree and kill it. Another webbed tree trunk as shown in the video below was spotted in a public park last December in Nanning City -- also in Guangxi -- where monster roots have grown to create a trellis effect. Remarkable: The web is so flimsy that the entire tree sways in the wind. Entangled: The trees are known for their extensive network of roots, which often grow above ground.

Article: (CNN)Filipinos are being warned to be on guard for flash floods and landslides as tropical storm Maysak approached the Asian island nation Saturday. Just a few days ago, Maysak gained super typhoon status thanks to its sustained 150 mph winds. It has since lost a lot of steam as it has spun west in the Pacific Ocean. It's now classified as a tropical storm, according to the Philippine national weather service, which calls it a different name, Chedeng. It boasts steady winds of more than 70 mph (115 kph) and gusts up to 90 mph as of 5 p.m. (5 a.m. ET) Saturday. Still, that doesn't mean Maysak won't pack a wallop. Authorities took preemptive steps to keep people safe such as barring outdoor activities like swimming, surfing, diving and boating in some locales, as well as a number of precautionary evacuations. Gabriel Llave, a disaster official, told PNA that tourists who arrive Saturday in and around the coastal town of Aurora "will not be accepted by the owners of hotels, resorts, inns and the like... and will be advised to return to their respective places." Aldczar Aurelio, a meteorologist with the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), said the storm was centered 200 miles southwest of Aurora province as of 5 p.m. (5 a.m. ET) and heading west at a 12.5 mph clip. It's expected to make landfall Sunday morning on the southeastern coast of Isabela province and be out of the Philippines by Monday. Ahead of the storm. Isabela Gov. Faustino Dry III warned Saturday that residents should act as if this will be "no ordinary typhoon." Dry told PNA, "We do not know what the impact will be once it will make landfall."

Article: England suffered an injury scare at the start of their practice'match' here in St Kitts when Stuart Broad dramatically slipped in his delivery stride and was left clutching his ankle on the floor. Broad had complained about the state of the crease, which was damp after overnight rain, after bowling just three balls of his first over of the day at Warner Park. The groundsmen placed sand on the crease but from the very next delivery Broad slipped and went crashing to the ground, a blow which necessitated lengthy treatment before he left the field. Stuart Broad limps out of England's warm-up match in Saint Kitts after slipping over during his delivery. Broad looked to be in considerable pain after the fall and was accompanied by physio Craig de Weymam. Broad required lengthy treatment on the pitch after clutching his left ankle following his fall. Broad looked in some pain as he lay on the ground following his dramatic fall while bowling. The team's medical staff rushed out to the middle to treat Broad following his fall. The Warner Park crease was damp following over night rain, causing the England bowler to slip. Broad went off to receive ice treatment and returned to the action shortly afterwards. England captain Alastair Cook (right) watches on as ground staff make running repairs to the crease. Broad in full stride during his first over as England take on a Saint Kitts and Nevis Invitational XI. Broad was able to walk off himself and after ice treatment should return to the action. England there are no long-term effects but it is a concern for them with the first Test against West Indies starting on Monday in Antigua. It added to the sense of farce surrounding what has become a practice session rather than a second match against one of the worst teams England can ever have played. England attempted to make the most of a bad lot when they loaned Jonathan Trott, Gary Ballance and Jonny Bairstow to their opponents to give them additional practice. But the move backfired for Trott who edged Jimmy Anderson to third slip off just the third ball of the day and departed for a duck to follow the 72 he made on his return to England colours on Monday. Jonathan Trott, who had switched to the Saint Kitts team, was removed for a duck by James Anderson. Shane Jeffers of Saint Kitts is bowled by England's Ben Stokes on day one of the second warm-up match. Stokes celebrates with wicketkeeper Jos Buttler after taking the wicket of Jeffers.

Article: Mark one up for the future of golf over its past and present as 21-year-old Jordan Spieth took the first-day honours with a stunning opening round of 64 on a spectacular day of scoring at the sun-baked 79th Masters. For much of the day it looked as if he might have to share top billing with 34-year-old Justin Rose and 45-year-old Ernie Els, as the Englishman and the South African posted scores of 67 to tie Charley Hoffman, an American representative of the rank and file. Last man out Jason Day would join them in the evening shadows. But by then Spieth had separated himself from the field to become the youngest first-round leader in Masters history with a fabulous run of six birdies in seven holes before adding a wonderful flourish at the 18th, where he brushed in a 25-foot birdie putt. Runner-up on his debut last year, he now owns a three-shot lead going into day two. Jordan Spieth sinks his birdie put on the 18th at Augusta to take a three-shot lead into the second round. Justin Rose made the early running with an impressive five-under-par 67. Rose consoles Gunn Yang after the amateur finished his round on 13 over. Most of the favoured names left Augusta National feeling reasonably content, as Rory McIlroy and defending champion Bubba Watson shot 71, while Dustin Johnson and Masters specialist Phil Mickelson opened with rounds of 70. Whether they will be feeling quite so content at falling so far behind such an awesome talent as the brilliant Texan is another matter. Spieth has barely been off a leader-board all year and there was no chance of him being off this one during this round where he hit flagsticks, holed putts from everywhere and enjoyed the requisite amount of fortune as well as a wayward drive at the 13th bounced off the Georgia pines into the middle of the fairway. It meant when he stood on the par-five 15th tee he was eight under after a scarcely credible 10 single putts on these treacherous greens. At that moment anything seemed possible — even a 62, thereby setting a new standard for scoring in the 155-year history of majors. Only once all day did he act his age and it was here on this risk-reward par five, as he ran up a six. Naturally, Spieth was not about to get greedy. ‘I made a mistake but a 64, my first score in the sixties on this course, I have nothing to complain about,’ he said. A packed crowd watch Rose on the 10th green during the first round. Rose and Charley Hoffman (above) made the early running at Augusta with a 67. South African Ernie Els rolled back the years with a superb 67 on Thursday. Rose in full bloom on day one is a sight as familiar as the glorious azaleas. In nine previous starts Rose has led on three occasions after the first round. Here he equalled his best Masters score, recorded on the opening day in 2004. That year he went on to hold the 36-hole lead as well, while in 2007 he was lying tied second going into the final round, eventually finishing tied fifth. Add all those memories of good days here to the fact he’s now a proven major champion following his US Open triumph in 2013, and there must be the hope this will prove rather more than an excellent opening gambit. Certainly that is how he is seeing it. ‘I’ve learned plenty from those previous occasions, like not getting ahead of yourself,’ he said. ‘I’ve learned that the hard way and now I can’t see any reason why I shouldn’t keep executing the gameplan. You’ve got to believe in yourself, especially when you’re a major winner.’ Els used his ball-striking skills to get out of trouble on the 17th hole during the first round. Rory McIlroy appeared relaxed as he walked down the ninth fairway with Phil Mickelson, right,. McIlroy recovered from a shaky start to finish the first round on one-under-par. Rose wasn’t the only Englishman to prosper, as in-form Paul Casey shot 69. ‘I played with Paul last week and he strikes me as a man with something to prove,’ said Rose. After Greg Norman, Els might be the great hard-luck story when it comes to fabulous players who never quite got it done here. Given how good he was at 25, he represents a cautionary tale for those who believe it inevitable McIlroy will win the Masters one day. Els is still trying, at 45, and what a joy to see one of the great ball-strikers roll back a decade or two rather than the years to post his five-under score. A wonderful eagle three at the 15th was followed by a superlative sand save from a buried lie at the 17th. Only at the last was there a modicum of disappointment. Two putts and it would have been his lowest score in 71 rounds at Augusta. But he took three. McIlroy recovered from a nervously played front nine with some familiar Augusta failings resurfacing as he failed to birdie either par five. Two clunked chip shots at the third and sixth also betrayed a level of tension that illustrated fully the momentous nature of the achievement he is trying to complete in shooting for the career grand slam. American Jordan Spieth celebrates with his caddie Michael Greller on the 18th. Defending champion Bubba Watson struggled to find his rhythm in opening round. Tiger Woods feels the heat with the world No 111 struggling to get under par during the opening round. Woods reacts to a poor chip shot on the third hole as the pressure begins to tell. There were also two encouraging moments during that front nine, however, when he turned what would have been double bogeys in the past into mere bogeys. At the par-five second he drove into a hazard and was staring an ugly seven in the face for openers until he got down in two blows from 100 yards. At the sixth, his mis-hit chip came back down the steep slope but he didn’t panic. He decided to take his putter for the second attempt and got down in two. The value of limiting the damage was emphasised further when he notched his first birdie of the day at the next. On the back nine, it was more like it from the 25-year-old. Over the front nine he had given up three shots on the par fives alone to playing partner Mickelson, but here he got the two birdies on offer at the 13th and the 15th. ‘I left myself in some awkward spots but I holed some good putts on the back nine,’ he said. ‘I was a little nervous on the front nine but mostly just too excited. It was a decent opener.’ The day as a whole was a lot better than that. One to savour, in fact.

Jordan Spieth carded a 64 to claim the lead on -8 after the first round. Jason Day, Ernie Els, Justin Rose and Charley Hoffman three shots behind. Rory McIlroy kept alive his hopes of claiming career grand slam with 71. Injury-hit Tiger Woods recorded a 73 in just his third start of the year.

'I hate looking for excuses but over the last month I think we have spent around two hours as a team training together, for the simple reason I don't have enough people to fulfil training. 'There are no ifs and buts about that — I just don't have enough players. 'We trained for half an hour on our last run as a team simply because we need all our players playing or we will not fulfil our fixtures.' Regarding the defeat to Wolves he added: 'We were totally outclassed. Full credit to Warrington they were outstanding.'

Article: (CNN)For the first time in eight years, a TV legend returned to doing what he does best. Contestants told to "come on down!" on the April 1 edition of "The Price Is Right" encountered not host Drew Carey but another familiar face in charge of the proceedings. Instead, there was Bob Barker, who hosted the TV game show for 35 years before stepping down in 2007. Looking spry at 91, Barker handled the first price-guessing game of the show, the classic "Lucky Seven," before turning hosting duties over to Carey, who finished up.

Article: Luke Shaw has conceded his debut season at Manchester United has been a frustrating one and admits he doesn't know what he would do if he scored against boyhood club Chelsea on Saturday. Shaw joined United last summer in a £31.5million transfer from Southampton after an impressive campaign on the south coast, which resulted in him playing for England at the World Cup. However, injuries have plagued the 19-year-old's start to life at Old Trafford with the defender picking up his latest fitness setback during United's 2-1 FA Cup sixth-round exit at home to Arsenal last month. Luke Shaw admits he has endured a 'frustrating' debut season at Manchester United giving himself a 'C-' The 19-year-old's campaign has been beset by injuries since joining from Southampton last summer. Shaw (second left) is back  training with United after missing their last five Premier League games. In total, Shaw has only made 17 appearances in all competitions - a figure he admits is less than satisfactory. “It’s been a frustrating one because of the injuries I’ve picked up but I’m loving it,' he told Match of the Day magazine in an exclusive interview. 'If I was to write a school report on my first season here I’d give myself a C-. You don’t realise just how big Man United is until you’re actually here – it’s frightening! It is the biggest club around.' Despite an injury-plagued beginning under Louis van Gaal, when fit Shaw describes himself as 'lucky' to be playing alongside players such as captain Wayne Rooney and record-signing Angel di Maria.

'I’m playing with the likes of Wayne Rooney, [Angel] Di Maria, [Radamel] Falcao and it’s weird because my friends always talk about them, saying how good they are and I’m just thinking “Wow, I play with them!” I’m probably one of the luckiest 19-year-olds to be alive,' he added. Shaw missed United's 4-2 demolition of Manchester City on Sunday as he continues to recover from the injury picked up on FA Cup duty against Arsenal. United's No 3 was back in training prior to the Manchester derby as the Red Devils moved four points clear of their rivals in third place in the Premier League. Van Gaal's men are now looking to record their seventh league win in a row when they travel to table-toppers Chelsea on Saturday evening. And Shaw, who grew up supporting Chelsea, is hoping to play a part in that fixture - adding that it is his favourite away ground to play at. 'I used to watch Chelsea every week. It was really good when I got to play at Stamford Bridge, I would say that’s my favourite away stadium to go to. Chelsea is one of the first games I look for when the new fixtures come out. 'I haven’t scored yet so I don’t know. If my first goal was to come against Chelsea I’m not sure what I’d do.'

Article: A former High Court judge who led the inquiry into the Bradford stadium fire which killed 56 football fans has dismissed claims the blaze was not an accident saying they are 'nonsense'. A new book by author Martin Fletcher has revealed a series of other blazes at businesses owned by or associated with Stafford Heginbotham, the club's chairman at the time of the tragedy in 1985. The official inquiry into the blaze, led by Mr Justice Oliver Popplewell, concluded that the fire was an accident, probably caused by a spectator dropping a cigarette into rubbish that had accumulated under an old timber stand at the Valley Parade ground. Former Bradford City chairman Stafford Heginbotham, left, with Mr Justice Popplewell in the aftermath of the Bradford City fire. Today, the former judge has dismissed claims the blaze was not an accident. The stand at the Valley Parade ground burns after a fire in 1985. 56 football fans were killed in the tragedy. Today Sir Oliver was asked about the new allegations in an interview on BBC Radio Leeds, where he rubbished Mr Fletcher's claims. The retired judge said the main flaw in the argument that the fire was arson was that the stand involved had no insurance value as it was due for demolition. He also added that the fire was examined by experienced and thorough investigators, who found nothing suspicious and that no question of arson was ever raised in civil legal proceedings. He explained: 'I'm sorry to spoil what is obviously a very good story but I'm afraid it's nonsense for a number of reasons.' Sir Oliver also rejected claims his inquiry was held too quickly, three weeks after the fire. He added: 'I can quite understand after having previous fires some suspicion being raised but, as far as I’m concerned, we conducted our inquiry perfectly properly and I have no reason believe it was other than an accident.' The new claims about the fire at Valley Parade are contained in the book Fifty-Six by Mr Fletcher, who was 12 at the time and escaped the blaze. Author Martin Fletcher has revealed a series of other blazes at businesses owned by or associated with Stafford Heginbotham, the club's chairman at the time of the tragedy in 1985. He is pictured here with his mother Susan as a 12-year-old. The fire broke out near to half-time during Bradford's game against Lincoln City on May 11, 1985 and within four minutes the stand was completely ablaze. Mr Fletcher lost three generations of his family in the tragedy, including his 11-year-old brother Andrew, the fire's youngest victim, as well as his father John, 34, uncle Peter, 32, and grandfather Eddie, 63. The book, published today and being serialised in The Guardian, does not make any direct allegations but Mr Fletcher says Mr Heginbotham’s history with fires, which he claims resulted in payouts totalling around £27 million in today’s terms, warranted further investigation. He asks: 'Could any man really be as unlucky as Heginbotham had been?' The disaster also occurred at a time, according to Mr Fletcher’s evidence, when the businessman was in desperate financial trouble - and two days after he discovered it would cost £2million to bring the ground up to safety standards required by Bradford’s promotion from the old Third Division. The fire at the ground broke out close to half-time during Bradford's home game against Lincoln City on May, 11, 1985. An official inquiry found that the fire was started by accidentally when a fan discarded a cigarette on to rubbish below the timber stand. Mr Fletcher is the only survivor to publicly challenge the official inquiry, which took place three weeks after the fire. Mr Fletcher is the only survivor to publicly challenge the official inquiry, describing it as inadequate and saying it took place far too close to the event. Meanwhile Mr Heginbotham’s son James, 47, has defended his father, who died in 1995. He told told the Daily Mirror: 'When you actually do your homework and see what he did for Bradford City Football Club it is a sickening accusation. It is just absolutely ridiculous. 'He never recovered from the fire. The stress of it is what killed him eventually. 'He’s no longer here to defend himself. It’s a real shame it has come to this.' Meanwhile, yesterday former sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe said the new allegations do not justify a new inquiry into the disaster. The remains of the stand after the fire. West Yorkshire Police said the force would consider any new evidence about the blaze, which also injured 265 people. Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher visited Valley Parade to survey the damage to the stand and pay her respects with her husband Dennis. Mr Sutcliffe, MP for Bradford South and deputy leader of Bradford City Council at the time of the tragedy, said he knew Mr Heginbotham 'flew by the seat of his pants' in terms of the finances of the club, but remains convinced by the conclusion of the inquiry. West Yorkshire Police said the force would consider any new evidence about the fire. Detective Superintendent Mark Ridley, of the Homicide and Major Enquiry Team, said: 'The jury at the inquest in 1985 delivered a verdict of misadventure. 'However should any evidence come to light which was not available to Her Majesty’s Coroner at the original inquest, then we will consider its significance and take appropriate action.' A minute’s silence is due to be held at every Premier League and Football League match on Saturday, April 25 to mark the forthcoming 30th anniversary of the fire. It was the worst stadium fire in the history of British football and prompted important safety changes in grounds across the land. The final of game of the season should have been a day of celebration for Bradford City. Before kick-off the team were presented with the trophy for winning the Third Division title as 11,076 fans watched on. But instead, May 11, 1985 ended in tragedy as flames engulfed the Main Stand at Valley Parade. The Valley Parade blaze is considered the worst stadium fire in the history of British football and prompted important safety changes in grounds across the land. The fire was spotted at 3.40pm towards the end of the first half and within minutes the stand packed with 4,000 spectators was fully ablaze. The disaster left 56 supporters dead and a further 265 injured. In the years that followed,  new legislation was introduced governing safety at the nation's sports grounds. The tragedy brought about an unprecedented  community spirit in the city, with, among many other initiatives, a fundraising drive for the Burns Unit at Bradford Royal Infirmary. In 2010, on the 25th anniversary, there were an estimated two thousand at the service in the city's Centenary Square but this year there has been such a surge of interest that the club considered moving it to Valley Parade.

Article: Niki Lauda’s red cap stood out like a beacon on the dull, grey tarmac of the biggest, most soulless paddock in all Formula One. The three-time world champion is colourful, candid and carefree. When your face is the charred remains of having nearly burned to death at the wheel of a Ferrari, why not throw caution to the wind or, in Shanghai’s case, the smog? Lauda, now chairman of Mercedes F1, aimed his first verbal grenade at his driver Nico Rosberg, who moments earlier had stood in front of him rotating his shoulders and about to play keepie-uppie to warm up for Friday's second practice session for the Chinese Grand Prix. Niki Lauda aimed a first verbal grenade at his driver Nico Rosberg ahead of the race in Shanghai. Mercedes AMG Petronas driver Rosberg is pushed back into his garage during the second practice session. Rosberg ended that session, as he did the first, behind Lewis Hamilton (below), his in-the-groove world champion team-mate who also markedly outperformed the German in the first two races, in Australia and Malaysia. Of course, not long after these words reach your breakfast tables in the shires, Rosberg may buck up and take pole, but it would be something of a surprise, not least to Lauda, if he did. ‘Yes, Nico is definitely a little bit behind Lewis,’ said the Austrian. ‘He has to sort himself out. It is not anything I can talk to him about. I don’t know why — he is not driving as well as he was. He will know what he has to do, and he must do it himself.’ Rosberg  looks on in the paddock after practice for the Chinese Formula One Grand Prix in Shanghai. Rosberg  drives during practice for the Formula One Grand Prix of China at Shanghai International Circuit. Rosberg is supremely professional. There is no lack of effort on his part. It is more that his confidence seems to have been shaken, whereas it was so strong in the early and mid parts of last season. Then Hamilton put down the hammer, changing the dynamic for both men. At least Rosberg is not the watching neutral’s only hope of a contest breaking out this season, after Ferrari shocked everyone by winning a fortnight ago. Nobody was ever more pleased to see Sebastian Vettel wagging his finger in celebration than fans whose own digits were poised over the television remotes’ off-switches, so jaundiced were they by the prospect of Mercedes’ seemingly endless hegemony.

Rosberg drives during practice for the Formula One Grand Prix of China at Shanghai International Circuit. As Bernie Ecclestone joked, Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff could have the legend, ‘The man who killed Formula One’, engraved on his tombstone. Lauda, a long-time friend of Ecclestone, has no time for sentiment. ‘Even if Ferrari winning makes Bernie happy, I will still be upset,’ he said. ‘The priority for me and Toto and Paddy (Lowe, the technical director) is to try to win every bloody race. It is our mission. Sebastian Vettel  looks on from the team garage during practice for the China Formula One Grand Prix. Vettel  drives during practice for the Formula One Grand Prix of China at Shanghai International Circuit. ‘I don’t care about the politics or what is good for Vettel or Ferrari. It is not my responsibility to make the sport more interesting. My worry for us is that Ferrari won so early in the season. ‘That gives them a lot of momentum. For an Italian team, momentum can be very important. ‘The Italians are emotional and it works best for them when they have a blend of English, Germans and Italians. They have that now (James Allison, a British engineer is their technical director). Vettel is a four-time world champion and so is someone to look up to. They have a combination of everything.’ Most observers thought Ferrari’s win in Malaysia might be a one-off created by the absurdly hot weather. But the evidence from practice is that the Scuderia may also be contenders in the considerably cooler Shanghai climate. Even though they appear not to be as quick over one lap, they look strong, possibly stronger than Mercedes, on a long run. Ferrari's German driver Vettel is pushed back to his garage after stopping at the pit lane exit in Shanghai. Vettel drives during practice for the Formula One Grand Prix of China at Shanghai International Circuit. ‘Qualifying doesn’t really worry us,’ said Lauda. ‘But they will be close on race pace. ‘They have made a big step up with their engine from last year to this, and I believe their horsepower is the same as ours.’ That was a big, honest and uplifting claim three races into a season that was being written off as a processional yawn.

Article: (CNN)Paul Walker is hardly the first actor to die during a production. But Walker's death in November 2013 at the age of 40 after a car crash was especially eerie given his rise to fame in the "Fast and Furious" film franchise. The release of "Furious 7" on Friday offers the opportunity for fans to remember -- and possibly grieve again -- the man that so many have praised as one of the nicest guys in Hollywood. "He was a person of humility, integrity, and compassion," military veteran Kyle Upham said in an email to CNN. Walker secretly paid for the engagement ring Upham shopped for with his bride. "We didn't know him personally but this was apparent in the short time we spent with him. I know that we will never forget him and he will always be someone very special to us," said Upham. The actor was on break from filming "Furious 7" at the time of the fiery accident, which also claimed the life of the car's driver, Roger Rodas. Producers said early on that they would not kill off Walker's character, Brian O'Connor, a former cop turned road racer. Instead, the script was rewritten and special effects were used to finish scenes, with Walker's brothers, Cody and Caleb, serving as body doubles. There are scenes that will resonate with the audience -- including the ending, in which the filmmakers figured out a touching way to pay tribute to Walker while "retiring" his character. At the premiere Wednesday night in Hollywood, Walker's co-star and close friend Vin Diesel gave a tearful speech before the screening, saying "This movie is more than a movie." "You'll feel it when you see it," Diesel said. "There's something emotional that happens to you, where you walk out of this movie and you appreciate everyone you love because you just never know when the last day is you're gonna see them." There have been multiple tributes to Walker leading up to the release. Diesel revealed in an interview with the "Today" show that he had named his newborn daughter after Walker. Social media has also been paying homage to the late actor. A week after Walker's death, about 5,000 people attended an outdoor memorial to him in Los Angeles. Most had never met him. Marcus Coleman told CNN he spent almost $1,000 to truck in a banner from Bakersfield for people to sign at the memorial. "It's like losing a friend or a really close family member... even though he is an actor and we never really met face to face," Coleman said. "Sitting there, bringing his movies into your house or watching on TV, it's like getting to know somebody. It really, really hurts." Walker's younger brother Cody told People magazine that he was initially nervous about how "Furious 7" would turn out, but he is happy with the film.

Article: These are the horrific final moments of a 44-year-old suspect who was apparently accidentally shot dead by a 73-year-old reserve deputy last week after he fired his handgun instead of his Taser. In the footage, released by police, deputies are filmed chasing after Eric Harris, first by car then on foot, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on April 2 after he fled during a sting operation in a nearby parking lot. Once they catch up to Harris, they tackle him to the ground and order him to lie on his stomach. Robert Bates then yells, 'Taser! Taser!' - but takes out his service weapon and pulls the trigger. After firing one round into Harris, the former full-time officer drops his gun from the recoil and says in shock: 'Oh, I shot him! I'm sorry.' Harris then starts yelping on the ground, while pleading for help. WARNING: GRAPHIC VIDEO. Chase: This newly-released video of Eric Harris's fatal shooting shows deputies chasing after Harris, first by car then on foot, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on April 2 after he fled during a sting operation in a nearby parking lot. Fleeing: The deputies run after Harris, who was allegedly caught trying to buy drugs and a gun from cops. View from the ground: Once they catch up to Harris, they tackle him to the ground and order him to lie on his stomach. Robert Bates then yells, 'Taser! Taser!' (pictured) - but takes out his handgun and pulls the trigger. The fatally-wounded man, who is being held down by his neck by the deputies, exclaims: 'Oh my god, he shot me! He shot me! He shot me, man.' He then adds: 'Oh, my god. I'm losing my breath.' Shockingly, one of the deputies replies: 'F*** your breath.' Another calls Harris, who is black and dressed in shorts and a T-shirt, a'motherf***er' and tells him: 'You shouldn't have f***ing ran.' Following the incident, during which the deputies do not appear to realize Harris has been fatally injured and even tell him to'shut the f*** up', the suspect was hospitalized. He died an hour later. The footage, obtained by NewsOn6, comes as a number of US shootings  involving police officers and  black suspects have hit the headlines. Many of the suspects were unarmed at the time. In the April 2 incident, Bates accidentally fired his gun thinking that he had pulled out his Taser - as proved by the fact he did not expect the weapon to recoil, the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office said. Bates, who had been monitoring the situation from afar, ran up to Harris in a bid 'to get the situation under control', before mistakenly firing his gun instead of his Taser, according to on-site deputies. Apology: After firing one round into Harris, the former full-time officer drops his gun from the recoil and says in shock: 'Oh, I shot him! I'm sorry' (pictured) Harris then starts yelping on the ground, while shouting, 'Help!' Shooting: This photo shows a deputy bending down to pick up Bates's dropped gun following the 'accidental' shooting in Tulsa earlier this month. Harris is being held down on the ground, out of shot, by other deputies. Terrified: The fatally-wounded man, who is being held by his neck and back by the deputies (pictured), says: 'Oh my god, he shot me! He shot me! He shot me, man.' He then adds: 'Oh, my god. I'm losing my breath' Suspect: Shockingly, one of the deputies replies: 'F*** your breath.' Another calls Harris (pictured in a police mug shot released d by officials on April 4) a'motherf***er' and tells him: 'You shouldn't have f***ing ran' Harris, who was being restrained at the time, had  allegedly fled after he was caught trying to buy drugs and a gun from deputies posing as dealers in the parking lot of a nearby dollar store. Major Shannon Clark told CNN: 'They were struggling trying to get him into custody, he ran up trying to use a less lethal device, trying to get the situation under control. 'Inadvertently he discharged a round from his service weapon.' He added: 'Did an accident happen? Sure. But is it accredited to his age? Or was it accredited to the rapidly evolving situation? I guess that will be determined in the investigation.' Bates, who has been a reserve since 2008, is the chief executive of Robert C Bates LLC, a Tulsa-based insurance company, who worked as an officer assigned to the Violent Crimes Task Force. Fatal: Following the incident, during which the deputies told Harris to'shut the f*** up', the suspect was hospitalized. He died an hour later. Above, blood appears to be running down Harris's arm at the scene. Scene: In this photo, which has been partially blanked out by the Sheriff's Office, deputies are pictured at the scene of the incident. The deputy in the foreground of the frame is holding down Harris following the shooting. He has also spent time with the Tulsa Police Auxiliary. Speaking to local site News OK, Bates said: 'It was me. My attorney has advised me not to comment. As much as I would like to, I can’t.' According to Tulsa Police, Harris had met an undercover officer to sell him a 9 mm semi-automatic pistol and 300 rounds ammunition. He fled the scene when deputies tried to arrest him, it is alleged. The suspect then fought with another deputy when he was shot, police said. He was gunned down accidentally by Bates after officers 'observed him reaching for his waistband area... causing concern for the deputies' safety,' authorities told CNN. Officers had been monitoring Harris as part of an investigation into the trade of methamphetamine. As he met with undercover deputies to allegedly hand over the drugs, he is accused of offering to throw in a sawed-off gun. Confusion: Bates, 73, accidentally grabbed his pistol and shot Harris (right, in a previous mug shot) dead, according to Tulsa police. Bates is classified as an advanced deputy. The incident is now under investigation. His convictions include escaping prison in 1990, robbery with a dangerous weapon in 1999, and making threatening phone calls. According to Tulsa Police, Harris' killer, Bates, is classified as an advanced deputy. Reserves are 'basic', 'intermediate', or 'advanced'. The qualify for 'advanced', officers are required to have a minimum of 320 hours of training and 25 hours of training a year. During the annual field training program, they are tested on how to use and identify lethal and non-lethal weapons. With the same power as paid deputies, reserves can conduct their own investigations, make arrests and work on task forces. The cause of Harris's death is under investigation.

He posted a vile, racist rant under the username @angeIsleftfoot which read: 'Welbeck is dead to me, the f****** c***…’ Danny Welbeck scored the winner as Arsenal beat Manchester United in the FA Cup quarter-final in March. The tweet, posted after Welbeck's decisive role in Arsenal's victory at Old Trafford, continued with sickening references that are too offensive to publish here.

Article: England suffered an injury scare at the start of their practice'match' here in St Kitts when Stuart Broad dramatically slipped in his delivery stride and was left clutching his ankle on the floor. Broad had complained about the state of the crease, which was damp after overnight rain, after bowling just three balls of his first over of the day at Warner Park. The groundsmen placed sand on the crease but from the very next delivery Broad slipped and went crashing to the ground, a blow which necessitated lengthy treatment before he left the field. Stuart Broad limps out of England's warm-up match in Saint Kitts after slipping over during his delivery. Broad looked to be in considerable pain after the fall and was accompanied by physio Craig de Weymam. Broad required lengthy treatment on the pitch after clutching his left ankle following his fall. Broad looked in some pain as he lay on the ground following his dramatic fall while bowling. The team's medical staff rushed out to the middle to treat Broad following his fall. The Warner Park crease was damp following over night rain, causing the England bowler to slip. Broad went off to receive ice treatment and returned to the action shortly afterwards. England captain Alastair Cook (right) watches on as ground staff make running repairs to the crease. Broad in full stride during his first over as England take on a Saint Kitts and Nevis Invitational XI. Broad was able to walk off himself and after ice treatment should return to the action. England there are no long-term effects but it is a concern for them with the first Test against West Indies starting on Monday in Antigua. It added to the sense of farce surrounding what has become a practice session rather than a second match against one of the worst teams England can ever have played. England attempted to make the most of a bad lot when they loaned Jonathan Trott, Gary Ballance and Jonny Bairstow to their opponents to give them additional practice. But the move backfired for Trott who edged Jimmy Anderson to third slip off just the third ball of the day and departed for a duck to follow the 72 he made on his return to England colours on Monday. Jonathan Trott, who had switched to the Saint Kitts team, was removed for a duck by James Anderson. Shane Jeffers of Saint Kitts is bowled by England's Ben Stokes on day one of the second warm-up match. Stokes celebrates with wicketkeeper Jos Buttler after taking the wicket of Jeffers.

Article: (CNN)Seventy years ago, Anne Frank died of typhus in a Nazi concentration camp at the age of 15. Just two weeks after her supposed death on March 31, 1945, the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp where she had been imprisoned was liberated -- timing that showed how close the Jewish diarist had been to surviving the Holocaust. But new research released by the Anne Frank House shows that Anne and her older sister, Margot Frank, died at least a month earlier than previously thought. Researchers re-examined archives of the Red Cross, the International Training Service and the Bergen-Belsen Memorial, along with testimonies of survivors. They concluded that Anne and Margot probably did not survive to March 1945 -- contradicting the date of death which had previously been determined by Dutch authorities. In 1944, Anne and seven others hiding in the Amsterdam secret annex were arrested and sent to the  Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. Anne Frank's final entry. That same year, Anne and Margot were separated from their mother and sent away to work as slave labor at the Bergen-Belsen camp in Germany. Days at the camp were filled with terror and dread, witnesses said. The sisters stayed in a section of the overcrowded camp with no lighting, little water and no latrine. They slept on lice-ridden straw and violent storms shredded the tents, according to the researchers. Like the other prisoners, the sisters endured long hours at roll call. Her classmate, Nannette Blitz, recalled seeing Anne there in December 1944: "She was no more than a skeleton by then. She was wrapped in a blanket; she couldn't bear to wear her clothes anymore because they were crawling with lice." Listen to Anne Frank's friends describe her concentration camp experience. As the Russians advanced further, the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp became even more crowded, bringing more disease. A deadly typhus outbreak caused thousands to die each day. Typhus is an infectious disease caused by lice that breaks out in places with poor hygiene. The disease causes high fever, chills and skin eruptions. "Because of the lice infesting the bedstraw and her clothes, Anne was exposed to the main carrier of epidemic typhus for an extended period," museum researchers wrote. They concluded that it's unlikely the sisters survived until March, because witnesses at the camp said the sisters both had symptoms before February 7. "Most deaths caused by typhus occur around twelve days after the first symptoms appear," wrote  authors Erika Prins and Gertjan Broek. The exact dates of death for Anne and Margot remain unclear. Margot died before Anne. "Anne never gave up hope," said Blitz, her friend. "She was absolutely convinced she would survive." Her diary endures as one of the world's most popular books. Read more about Anne Frank's cousin, a keeper of her legacy.

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence. New research suggests that Anne Frank and her sister Margot died at least a month earlier than previously thought, likely in late January or early February 1945, due to typhus contracted at Bergen-Belsen concentration

'The tests have been Liverpool and City,' he told Press Association Sport. 'This is another test. They have proven themselves, but this is the best team in the country and to go to Stamford Bridge is the toughest test. Louis van Gaal's side have performed admirably this season and are all but guaranteed Champions League. 'The performances from United in the past month have been absolutely outstanding in any season.

Article: Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid couldn't be separated in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final showdown on Tuesday. The two giants from the Spanish capital played out a goalless draw, meaning all is left to play for in the second leg at the Santiago Bernabeu. Here, Sportsmail rates the players in the first leg of the Champions League quarter-final at the Vicente Calderon. ATLETICO MADRID. Jan Oblak 9 - Blocked everything in the first half as a wind-assisted Real Madrid looked like putting the tie beyond doubt in the first 45 minutes. Had less to do in the second half but did it well. A man of the match display from the 22-year-old. Atletico Madrid goalkeeper Jan Oblak made a big save to deny Gareth Bale in the early minutes. Juanfran 7 - He was rattled, along with the rest of the team, in the first half but he played his part in keeping Madrid at bay. Miranda 7 - Will not have put any watching suitors off with another solid display alongside Godin - that is the third time this season Real have failed to score against Atletico Madrid at the Calderon and Miranda is a major reason for that. Diego Godin 7 - A rare slip early on let Bale in but the Welshman failed to punish the Uruguayan and he recovered well to marshall the team to another clean sheet against the European champions. At times in the first half he must have been seeing flashbacks of extra time in Lisbon but came through without conceding. Atletico Madrid centre-back Diego Godin rises higher than Sergio Ramos to attempt a header on goal. Guilherme Siqueira 6 - No mystery why Diego Simeone wants Felipe Luis back at the club next season. Siquiera is a threat going forward but a liability defensively and will be replaced in the summer. Arda Turan 7 - Always bright going forward and tested Casillas in the second period with a shot the Spain keeper did well to save. Will be vital in nicking a goal at the Bernabeu next week. Mario Suarez 6 - Forced a fine second-half save from Casillas but was just as blown away by Real in the first 45 minutes. Will still be a steal for someone at the end of the season if, as expected, he moves on. Gabi 6 - Simeone's soldier worked hard in defence in the first period but maybe lacked invention in the second period as Atletico took the initiative. Cristiano Ronaldo is crowded out by Atletico Madrid's Mario Suarez (left) and Gabi. Koke 6 - Currently struggling to live up to those 'new Xavi' tags. Still a tremendous prospect and gave as good as he got against Real's trio of Modric, James and Kroos. Antoine Griezmann 7 - You can see why he has scored 21 goals this season in a little over 40 games. He is always bright and showed pace and surprising strength in the first period to pull away from Ramos. Tough to play against and he will be important for Atletico on the break at the Bernabeu. Mario Mandzukic 7 - The old warhorse was elbowed by Ramos, bitten and punched by Carvajal and booked for complaining. He was a bloody hero too and had to be bandaged up midway through the second half. Still lacks that pace to pull away into space that Diego Costa has. Substitutes: Raul Garcia (Griezmann 77), Torres (Koke 83). Not used: Moya, Tiago, Saul, Jesus Gamez, Gimenez. REAL MADRID. Iker Casillas 7- Stayed awake in the first half as Real poured forward but Atletico Madrid still threatened on the break. Also kept out Mario Suarez' late shot as Real managed to hang on. Iker Casillas makes a save as Atletico Madrid striker Fernando Torres goes for the ball. Dani Carvajal 7 - Was used as an auxiliary winger in the first 45 minutes as Real tried to take advantage of Siqueira’s weakness. Also scrapped at the back and landed a punch and a bite on Manzukic as tempers frayed. That might still cost him his place in the second leg. Raphael Varane 8 - Real Madrid's best performer. We knew he was quick but how quick! His first half sprint down the right was worthy of Bale. Is there a quicker defender in Europe at the moment? Quite possibly not. When Pepe pulled out before the start of the game many Real Madrid fans would have feared the worst but Varane never put a foot wrong. Raphael Varane was in excellent form for Real Madrid in defence at the Vicente Calderon. Sergio Ramos 6 - Left trailing in Griezmann’s wake early on but was a match for Mandzukic. Solid but without the heroics of Lisbon and that last-minute goal. Marcelo 7 - Asked to attack less in the first half with Carvajal trying to do more damage on the other flank. Did all that was asked of him defensively without shining going forward as he can do. Booked and will not play second leg. Luka Modric 7 - Majestic in the first half as Madrid dominated but faded like his team in the second. Still the most complete midfielder that Real Madrid have and they were never going to lose 4-0 as they did in February without him. He will be vital in the second leg. Luka Modric was majestic in the first half for Real Madrid, but he faded along with the team in the second. Toni Kroos 6 - A shame that he has less license to attack in his current incarnation as Madrid’s holder. Covered ground, got Madrid passing and still managed a shot that Oblak saved, but wouldn't he have more influence on games if he played slightly further forward? James Rodriguez 6 - Only just back from injury and it showed in the second half. Could easily have made way for Isco, who eventually replaced Benzema. Has magic in his boots and had a fine chance to win it on the night but couldn't take it. Gareth Bale 7 - Provided cross after cross in the first half as he tormented Siqueira but they came to nothing and Madrid were left to rue the chance he had when Godin slipped and he was through on Oblak’s goal. He will be blamed because of that miss but worked hard and could still be key in the second leg with Atletico's weakness at left back. Bale missed an excellent opportunity to give Real the lead and a priceless away goal. Karim Benzema 5 - Struggles to score against Atletico and was taken off in the second half as he once again failed to puncture their rearguard. Missed a fine chance in the second period when for some reason he flicked the ball back towards Ronaldo instead of trying to beat Oblak himself. Cristiano Ronaldo 6 - Had several free-kicks in the first half that failed to trouble Oblak, Also failed to connect with those excellent first-half crosses from Bale. Atletico Madrid are a tough nut to crack and the world’s most expensive forward line couldn’t find the vital away goal. Ronaldo was just as responsible as Bale and Benzema for that. Substitutes: Arbeloa (Carvajal 85), Isco (Benzema 76). Not used: Navas, Pepe, Khedira, Jese, Illarramendi. Ronaldo endured a frustrating evening as he was unable to find a breakthrough for his team.

Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid draw 0-0 at Vicente Calderon. Jan Oblak was excellent in goal for Atletico to keep Real at bay. Gareth Bale had a huge chance to score an away goal for Real. Raphael Varane was Real Madrid's best player in defence. Karim Benzema's struggles against Atletico Madrid continued.

Article: (CNN)A year ago Bloomberg published a story with the following headline: Mike Pence, a Koch Favorite, Mulls 2016 Run for President. The story ticked off items on Pence's conservative things-to-do list while also noting his close ties to the deep-pocketed Koch brothers, as well as other right-wing lobbying groups. Last August the Indiana governor was in Dallas for an Americans for Prosperity event; the group is backed by the conservative Koch brothers, and supported Gov. Pence's tax-slashing budget. Now, Pence is drawing huge heat for his controversial decision to sign a religious freedom law last week that opens the door to discrimination against gays and lesbians.  Why would Pence ignore the pleas of Indiana's Chamber of Commerce as well as the Republican mayor of his state capital and sign such a bill? Because there's a very powerful wing of his party that wants a conservative as its 2016 candidate and this bill was Pence's way of shoring up his street cred. It is also the reason why Republican Jeb Bush, Pence's fellow White House hopeful, who is viewed as a little light in that category, was first to rush in to defend Pence and the law. One lesson here: Just because more than 70% of the country now lives in states where same-sex marriage is legal does not mean 70% of the country is happy about it. Backlash aside, the fact is Pence has scored a lot of points this week among ultraconservatives. And while that may not be enough to get him over this political hump, the very public debate that now embroils him — and Arkansas Gov.  Asa Hutchinson, and likely 14 other states considering similar proposals this year -- is more than enough to drag the entire Republican field farther to the right than the party had hoped. Pence: 'Was I expecting this kind of backlash? Heavens no.' For there is no way a Republican can get through the pending primary without denouncing LGBT rights, which unfortunately will turn numerous Americans into single-issue voters. I foolishly hoped the issue of LGBT rights would be a bit player in the 2016 general election, overshadowed by foreign policy and the economy. Instead it looks like it's going to be dragged down to a replay of Pat Buchanan's "cultural war" speech, during which he told the 1992 Republican National Convention: "We stand with (George H.W. Bush) against the amoral idea that gay and lesbian couples should have the same standing in law as married men and women" and later followed with "There is a religious war going on in this country. It is a cultural war, as critical to the kind of nation we shall be as the Cold War itself. For this war is for the soul of America." Progressives may enjoy watching Pence's temporary fall from grace, but his policy rhetoric has echoed that of 2016 hopeful Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who has indicated a federal ban on same-sex marriage is not off the GOP table. And even if you think neither Pence nor Bush nor Cruz will win the nomination, someone has to. In light of that, listen to conservative former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, a potential 2016 candidate describing  conservatives' discomfort with same-sex marriage: "It's like asking someone who's Jewish to start serving bacon-wrapped shrimp in their deli." Or Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal: "I certainly will support Ted Cruz and others that are talking about making... a constitutional amendment to allow states to continue to define marriage." Or Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who has a long history of fighting against same-sex marriage and civil unions. And Ben Carson said jail turns people gay, so there's that. Remember: Pence didn't act alone. He only signed a bill that first passed muster with other elected officials. In fact, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, "the Indiana RFRA [Religious Freedom Restoration Act] is one of 24 introduced in 15 states this year that could allow someone to use their religious beliefs to discriminate. Numerous other bills specifically single out the LGBT community for unequal treatment." Who supports, denounces Indiana law? Gallup Polls may suggest voters nationwide are more gay-friendly, but the trend on the state level tells a different story. Perhaps we're witnessing the final gasp of long-ago biases. Or maybe those biases are having a rebirth we had underestimated. Former Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, the first member of Congress to marry someone of the same sex while in office, said he believes Republicans want the Supreme Court to rule in favor of same-sex marriage to provide political cover in the GOP primary. "We're winning," he told a crowd in Chicago recently while promoting his latest book. I guess if you look at where the country was on LGBT issues 10 years ago, we definitely are. That's assuming you are part of the "we" who believe LGBT people should have the same rights as their heterosexual/cisgender counterparts. But as the situation in Indiana has shown, "winning" should not be mistaken for having "won." For it is doubtful that a candidate will be able to avoid taking a position on the wave of so-called "religious freedom" bills snaking through red-state legislatures. Or to sidestep the topic of a constitutional amendment when it's raised in a debate or at a campaign stop, especially with Republicans controlling both the House and the Senate. Pence, and to a lesser extent, Jeb Bush, may be toxic now but America has a short attention span. More importantly, they are not alone. Frank said when progressives get angry they march in the streets, and when conservatives get mad they march to the polls. If that holds true in 2016, "winning" is going to feel very strange.

Article: It's that time of the season when Premier League footballers cast their vote for the PFA Players’ Player of the Year. Last year’s winner Luis Suarez now resides in Spain, so, too, does 2013 victor Gareth Bale. It means we’re almost certain to see a new name on the trophy come May. Here, Sportsmail runs you through the six leading contenders…. Name: Harry Kane. Club: Tottenham. Age: 21. Stats: Apps 44, Goals 29. Striker Harry Kane has hit an astonishing 29 goals in 44 games for Tottenham so far this season. Kane (second right) has twice been named Player of the Month during his breakthrough campaign. Kane (left) broke into the England squad and scored 79 seconds into his debut against Lithuania. Reasons he deserves it: Very few would have predicted Kane would plunder an incredible 29 goals by early April in what is essentially his breakthrough season. His has been the name on everyone’s lips since the turn of the year and last month’s England call-up was thoroughly deserved. In an age where diving, spitting, lying and cheating too often dominate our news agenda, Kane’s goal-laden arrival has been a joy to witness. Reasons he doesn’t: Are there any? You could argue it took him until November to score two Premier League goals but that was as much to do with a lack of opportunities. Previous (individual) Premier League honours: Player of the Month (2) Name: Eden Hazard. Club: Chelsea. Age: 24. Stats: Apps 44, Goals 17. Eden Hazard has been Chelsea's outstanding performer, scoring 17 times in 44 games. Hazard (left) has been a menace to opponents all season with his trickery and high workrate. Hazard (centre) is the odds-on favourite to be named PFA Players' Player of the Year. Reasons he deserves it: He’s running back into form at just the right time and his goals look like they’ll edge Chelsea towards the title. Hazard, under the instruction of Jose Mourinho, has married graft to his craft and has been his side’s outstanding player this season. The fact he works so hard in addition to his creativity is sure to earn the respect of fellow pros and it’s no surprise he is the odds-on favourite for the prize. Reasons he doesn’t: Like Kane, it is hard to make an argument against a player who has performed at such a high level on a consistent basis. It did, however, take the Belgian a little while to find his scoring stride and he netted just once in the opening nine matches of the campaign. Previous honours: PFA Young Player of the Year 2014, PFA Team of the Year 2013 & 2014. Name: Diego Costa. Club: Chelsea. Age: 26. Stats: Apps 30, Goals 18. Reasons he deserves it: His immediate impact was sensational, smashing seven goals in his first four outings. His presence as the spearhead of Chelsea’s attack has turned them into title winners and he isn’t afraid to put in a shift either. Diego Costa has spearheaded Chelsea's attack this season, with 18 goals in 30 appearances. Costa (right) fires in the winner for Chelsea in their 2-1 victory over Liverpool at Anfield. Costa's bid to become Player of the Year could be hampered by the games he has missed through injury. Reasons he doesn’t: He’s missed too many games because of injury, as well as suspension, and is too often on our back pages for the wrong reasons. It is that edge which will probably dissuade fellow pros from voting for the Spaniard. Previous honours: Player of the Month (1) Name: Sergio Aguero. Club: Manchester City. Age: 26. Stats: Apps 31, Goals 23. Reasons he deserves it: Without his goals City’s title challenge would have faded long ago. It has been a poor season at the Etihad. Aguero, though, has managed to mask those shortcomings with his brilliance. His four goals against Spurs and match-winning treble versus Bayern Munich are among the best individual performances of the season. Meanwhile, he was so devastating during his two-goal show at Sunderland that the home crowd rose to applaud the Argentine when he made way late on. Sergio Aguero has again been in prolific scoring form for Manchester City, blasting 23 goals in  31 matches. Aguero (right) has struggled with fitness and has only managed to score three times in the league in 2015. Reasons he doesn’t: If Aguero managed to avoid what are all-too-frequent visits to the treatment room then City might be pushing Chelsea harder for the league title. He only has three league goals in 2015 and, while his numbers remain impressive, that lack of consistency will cost him votes. Previous honours: Player of the Month (2) Name: David de Gea. Club: Manchester United. Age: 24. Stats: Apps 37, Clean sheets 13. David de Gea (left) has been outstanding for Manchester United with 13 clean sheets this season. De Gea shone for United in the early part of the Premier League campaign when United struggled for form. De Gea's displays have been integral to United's top-four charge and he has been their best player. Reasons he deserves it: Only De Gea was spared criticism as United struggled to find their rhythm during the early part of the season. Indeed, there was an argument that, without his points-saving heroics, Louis van Gaal might have come under pressure far sooner. He has matured into the goalkeeper Sir Alex Ferguson thought he would and it is little wonder he is now being courted by the likes of Real Madrid. Reasons he doesn’t: Only the goalkeeper in a title-winning side would land the PFA prize, you feel. For while De Gea has been United’s best player, he has not single-handedly done enough to turn them into challengers for the Premier League crown. Previous honours: PFA Team of the Year 2013. Name: Alexis Sanchez. Club: Arsenal. Age: 26. Stats: Apps 43, Goals 20. Alexis Sanchez hit the ground running at Arsenal following his Barcelona switch, with 20 goals in 43 games. Sanchez hit 14 goals in 18 appearances during his most relentless scoring period this season. Chile international Sanchez has added greater aggression to Arsenal's attacking line with his arrival. Reasons he deserves it: There was a suspicion it would take the Chilean time to settle in the Premier League. Well, he didn’t score in his first four matches but then embarked on a run which yielded 14 in 18. His energy, aggression and will to win – coupled with bags of quality – has made all to the difference to an Arsenal side previously lacking in such vigour. Reasons he doesn’t: His goals have dried up since January and his awesome autumn could well be forgotten by the time votes are cast. However, he is still a certainty for Arsenal’s individual annual honours. Previous honours: Player of the Month (1) Name: Jordan Henderson. Club: Liverpool. Age: 24. Stats: Apps 45, Goals 7. Reasons he deserves it: He has emerged as Liverpool’s future captain having taken on responsibility in the centre of the park. Henderson barely misses a minute and is now a certain starter for his country – not bad for a player who Sir Alex Ferguson said could not run properly. He’s also added goals to his game and is a real pro’s pro – it would be no surprise to see him land his fair share of the votes. Jordan Henderson (centre) has continued his development into an essential player for Liverpool this season. Henderson emerged as Liverpool's future captain with Steven Gerrard (right) leaving at the end of the season. Henderson has added more goals to his game and has been ever present throughout Liverpool's campaign. Reasons he doesn’t: It hasn’t been a vintage year for Liverpool and their bid for Champions League football looks set to end in failure. As good as Henderson has been, this will almost certainly cost him the top prize. Previous honours: None. VERDICT: If the bookies are to be believed then the award will be going to last season’s Young Player of the Year, Eden Hazard. However, don’t underestimate the amount of goodwill there is towards Harry Kane within the game and he could well clean up with both the young and senior prizes. And that Roy of the Rovers tale would be a victory for everything we love about the game. Kane certainly gets my vote!

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence.
Premier League footballers are voting for PFA Players' Player of the Year. Eden Hazard and Harry Kane are the leading candidates for the award. Sergio Aguero, Alexis Sanchez and David de Gea are also contenders. Luis Suarez won last year with Gareth Bale taking the prize the year before.

Article: Louis van Gaal couldn’t let the moment pass. Manchester United had just rattled off their 13th home win of the season and the Dutchman wanted to crank up the pressure. A comfortable victory over Aston Villa, inspired by two goals from the excellent Ander Herrera and crowned by Wayne Rooney’s magnificent strike, had seen United leap above Manchester City in the table for the first time since November 23, 2013. When you think on January 10 this year the gap between the two clubs was 10 points, the turnaround has been remarkable. But now, as they head into their latest local squabble, there is mounting confidence around Old Trafford that United will not surrender their position. Louis van Gaal has piled pressure on Manchester City ahead of their games against Crystal Palace and United. Manchester United picked up all three points at the weekend by beating Aston Villa 3-1 at Old Trafford. Van Gaal believes Manchester City's players may struggle to get to grips with being in fourth spot. MANCHESTER UNITED (4-3-3): De Gea 6; Valencia 7, Jones 7, Rojo 7, Blind 7: Herrera 8.5, Carrick 7, Fellaini 6.5 (Falcao 77mins): Mata 7.5, Rooney 8, Young 6.5 (Di Maria 70. 6.5) Subs not used: Valdes, Rafael, Januzaj, McNair, Pereira. Scorers: Herrera 43, 90, Rooney 79. ASTON VILLA (4-4-2): Guzan 7: Hutton 5.5 (Bacuna 46, 5), Okore 5.5, Clark 5.5, Lowton 5: N’Zogbia 5 (Baker 61, 5), Sanchez 6, Delph 6, Weimann 5 (Cole 77): Benteke 6.5, Agbonlahor 5. Subs not used: Given, Vlaar, Gil, Grealish. Booked: Delph. Scorer: Benteke 80. Man of the match: Ander Herrera. Referee: Roger East 6. Is it feasible for City to finish fourth? They face Crystal Palace on Monday evening and Van Gaal believes dropping down two positions will creep into the psychology of Manuel Pellegrini’s squad. Even if City win at Selhurst Park, how will they handle the furnace that awaits this Sunday? ‘It plays a part in the spirit of the players — of our opponents but also our players,’ said Van Gaal. ‘We have more confidence now and when (if) they lose a point against Crystal Palace, then it is also sitting in their minds. ‘I don’t know the individual players of Manchester City so well, so I cannot judge them. But we have a lot of confidence and we haven’t lost so many times at home. The next game is going to be the decisive game.’ Van Gaal is aware recent history spells doom for United. They have lost seven of the last nine Manchester derbies, including each of the last four. Remarkably, they have not beaten City at home since Rooney scored that breath-taking bicycle kick in February 2011. City, few would dispute, have the better squad but, regardless of what happens in south London, will they be able to hold United’s momentum? Can they match their spirit? Big games are bringing the best out of Van Gaal’s men and they are clearly relishing the opportunity that awaits. Manchester United have not beaten City at Old Trafford since Wayne Rooney's wonder goal in February 2011. Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero scored in his side's 1-0 win over United back in November. Rooney likes playing against Villa — this was his 13th career goal against them. Newcastle (12) are his second favourite opponents. Man United lead rivals Man City by one point. ‘It was another Manchester United, I believe,’ said Van Gaal, when asked how he reflected on the 1-0 defeat he suffered at the Etihad Stadium in November. ‘We have developed the team. That was more in the start of the process and now we are in the end of the process. ‘So I think also the confidence of our players is very high at the moment but also our performances shows that so it’s not the same Manchester United. It’s like the game against Liverpool and the game (coming up) against Chelsea — you have to win these kinds of matches.’ With Liverpool’s defeat by Arsenal effectively ending the doubt over which sides will finish in the top four, it now becomes a question of what order Chelsea, Arsenal and the two Manchester clubs will be after the final games have been played. United’s run-in is laced with demanding assignments — aside from City, they must go to Stamford Bridge on April 18, face a trip to Goodison Park the following week and host Arsenal on May 16 — but they have an aura once more. Manchester United defender Chris Smalling saw red during the Premier League clash at the Etihad Stadium. Man United vs Man City - April 12. Chelsea vs Man United - April 18. Everton vs Man United - April 26. Man United vs West Brom - May 2. Crystal Palace vs Man United - May 9. Man United vs Arsenal - May 17. Hull vs Man United - May 24. Crystal Palace vs Man City - April 6. Man United vs Man City - April 12. Man City vs West Ham - April 19. Man City vs Aston Villa - April 25. Tottenham vs Man City - May 3. Man City vs QPR - May 10. Swansea vs Man City - May 17. Man City vs Southampton - May 24. Villa, stymied by injury problems that Tim Sherwood described as ‘crippling’, simply couldn’t cope once they went conceded in the 43rd minute and the manager, who was noticeably glum afterwards, can at least take solace from the fact Queens Park Rangers will not offer the same threat on Tuesday. ‘We know it will be tough but as long as we can play the way we have shown, especially in the last few games, it’s going to be a great game,’ said Ashley Young, who admitted he was ‘disappointed’ to not be selected for the last round of England games. ‘Hopefully we will get the three points. Of course it would be nice but we are just taking each game as it comes.’ There was never any hint they would slip up here, bossing the first half and then going through the gears after a slow period after the break to swat Villa aside. Herrara, with his slick passing and industry, was terrific. Rooney’s 14th strike of the campaign, meanwhile, was sensational. ‘It's about momentum, especially when you are going into this vital stage of the season,’ Young added. ‘United teams always come strong at this stage and we are showing in every game just how strong we can be – and even how we finish the game. We will enjoy this but it is all about next week.’ Ashley Young (left, pictured with Herrera) believes his side are building momentum ahead of the derby.

Article: (CNN)If you're famous and performing the American national anthem, be prepared to become a national hero or a national disgrace. Facts are facts.  Just ask Vince, Whitney, Roseanne, Jimi and Michael. Mötley Crüe's Vince Neil reminded us again this week of the dangers of tackling "The Star-Spangled Banner." Sure, he can shred it on "Girls, Girls, Girls" and "Dr. Feelgood," but this is a different story -- a completely different story. To say Neil butchered the song before the Las Vegas Outlaws Arena Football League game would be unkind to those in the profession.  There's less carnage when butchers are done with their work. The late Whitney Houston set the modern standard for the national anthem at Super Bowl XXV.  In the early stages of the Gulf War in 1991, a patriotic America saluted her performance. Just six months earlier, comedian Roseanne Barr may have established the low-water mark. The crowd at the San Diego Padres game booed her rendition and President George H. W. Bush called it "disgraceful." There's nothing quite like getting the presidential thumbs down. One of the most controversial and beloved versions of "The Star-Spangled Banner" comes from 1969. Guitar slinger Jimi Hendrix inflamed mainstream America with his psychedelic take on the national anthem to the delight of the Woodstock generation. And then there's Michael Bolton's version.  Overly wrought songs are his specialty and he doesn't disappoint in that department when he sings at the American League Championship Series in 2003.  Bolton belts it out, but there's one little problem -- the words.  Can anyone say crib notes?

Article: In the search for meaning and importance, the FA Cup might have found its saviour. Enter Liverpool and Brendan Rodgers, a club and manager not just popping into the party to say a polite hello and a quick goodbye. Tonight, against Blackburn at Ewood Park, Rodgers faces one of those defining moments in a season that has not lacked them. His only hope must be that this time it doesn't go so horribly wrong. So far it has been a theme of the campaign that when the need was greatest, so too have been the disappointments. He loaded for duck on a bear hunt in the Champions League against Real Madrid and lost. He wanted to save his best resources for Chelsea and lost that game, too. Kolo Toure found the net in Liverpool's FA Cup clash with Blackburn but his effort was ruled out. Blackburn salute their fans at Anfield after earning a Sixth Round replay at home to the Premier League side. When the European portion of their season fizzled out, first in the big show and then in the Europa League, the Premier League offered an opportunity. Getting into the top-four without Luis Suarez and often in the absence of Daniel Sturridge would be an immense achievement. Having started the season so badly and recovered so impressively, it became a real possibility. Then two huge games - Manchester United and Arsenal. A chance. Steven Gerrard lost his mind, the defence lost the plot and Liverpool lost by a combined total of 6-2 across the two games. A top-four place is virtually gone, unless anyone can conceivably see them making up seven points and a massive goal difference on Manchester City. Suddenly, the romance of the FA Cup is a little more two-sided. They need it badly. Steven Gerrard's birthday falls on May 30, the same day as the FA Cup final at Wembley. The FA Cup represents Liverpool's last chance of silverware after a disappointing season. 'I don't want to go down the route of saying that it saves our season,' said Rodgers before the replay of their quarter-final against Blackburn. 'Our objective at the start, though, was to win a trophy. 'So I think if we didn't get in the top four and we didn't have a trophy this year, we would be disappointed. I think certainly the FA Cup would give us a great boost as a team with lots of young players and players coming into the club. 'That's the expectancy we want. We want to be able to be challenging every year. 'That was the key thing for me, to get the group challenging at the top end of the league and for trophies. The FA Cup would mark a good step forward for us.' The need for trophies has been a dominant theme since Rodgers took over at Liverpool and made them contenders again. There is no denying the steps he has taken with the club and very little to suggest he is anything other than one of the sharpest managerial minds working in this country. Daniel Sturridge will be crucial to Liverpool's chances of reaching the FA Cup semi-final. Glen Johnson is in good spirits in training ahead of Liverpool's trip to Ewood Park on Wednesday. But how he will be tested if this season ends without either a top-four place or a trophy. Raheem Sterling rather helpfully alluded to the need for the latter recently. That tricky contract situation has not gone away and it is less likely to have a happy ending for Liverpool if they can't present a silver argument to Sterling in the summer. The same goes for potential new arrivals. Rodgers can talk magnificently and persuasively but his sales pitches to leading players would be enhanced immeasurably if he could talk about current achievements. Something shiny and tangible and recently acquired would help. It's a tough ask. They face Blackburn with a defence looking as woefully shaky as it did at the start of the season. Without Martin Skrtel and Emre Can tonight that defence could be vulnerable again. Steven Gerrard is also missing. Not ideal, though not necessarily a tremendous setback against a Championship side. In any case, Liverpool and Rodgers need to find a way through. It has been three years since they last won a trophy – under Kenny Dalglish - and the FA Cup is a chance to stop the clock. It's a defining moment that must not end in another failure. Liverpool have not won a trophy since they beat Cardiff to win the Carling Cup three years ago. Real Madrid 1-0 Liverpool, November 4. Finally back on the grandest stage, but Rodgers opted for a watered down XI. Dejan Lovren, Steven Gerrard, Raheem Stirling, Jordan Henderson, Philippe Coutinho and Mario Balotelli played all previous Champions League matches but none of them started. The aim, it appeared, was to prioritise the following league game. Karim Benzema celebrates scoring for Real Madrid against Liverpool at the Bernabeu. Liverpool 1-2 Chelsea, November 8. It was time to vindicate the gamble in Madrid, which was widely criticised. Rodgers made seven changes to the side that lost in the Champions League and Emre Can put them ahead. But Chelsea won 2-1, leaving Liverpool eighth in the Premier League. Having rested a host of players in Madrid, Brendan Rodgers' side then lost a crunch league game to Chelsea. Chelsea 1-0 Liverpool, January 27. After drawing the first leg of their Capital One Cup semi-final, Liverpool blew a host of chances and fell to a stoppage-time winner. A big opportunity missed. The Stamford Bridge also knocked Liverpool out of the Capital One Cup following a 1-0 win at home. Besiktas 1-0 Liverpool, February 26. Ten years after their Champions League miracle in Istanbul, Liverpool returned to face Besiktas in the Europa League last 32. They held a 1-0 first-leg lead. It went horribly wrong and they lost on penalties. 'Unfortunately, on this occasion, Istanbul is not a happy place,' said Rodgers. Demba Ba celebrates after Dejan Lovren missed the crucial penalty in the shoot-out against Besiktas. Arsenal 4-1 Liverpool, April 4. Liverpool's last real shot at getting into the top four and it fell apart spectacularly. Raheem Sterling's unauthorised interview hardly helped matters in the build-up and the game was a disaster. They were 3-0 down at half-time and ultimately repeated the kind of defensive inadequacies that hurt them earlier in the campaign. A huge anti-climax. Mesut Ozil curls home Arsenal's second in their 4-1 win over Liverpool in the Premier League last weekend.

Liverpool take on Blackburn in their FA Cup Sixth Round replay tonight. The competition represents the Anfield club's last chance of success. Brendan Rodgers' side are all but out of the race for the top four. Liverpool also endured poor campaigns in both European campaigns. Robbie Fowler: FA Cup hunt must not be all about Steven Gerrard.

Article: Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez is a star-studded strike force that almost every team in the world would dearly love to have, but when the going gets tough, Barcelona turn to Jeremy Mathieu and Gerard Pique. The French centre-back flung himself through the air to reach Xavi's free kick at the back post, heading home from close range, finally breaching Celta Vigo's stern defence. It was Mathieu who had opened the scoring in the El Clasico, in similar fashion. Pique, meanwhile, just a minute before Mathieu scored, had made an incredible, game-saving tackle on Celta striker Charles, to prevent him from opening the scoring. Jeremy Mathieu (right) heads home in the 73rd minute to hand Barcelona a 1-0 lead against Celta Vigo. Celta Vigo goalkeeper Alvarez Conde (right) is unable to stop the powerful header from Mathieu. Celta Vigo: Alvarez Conde, Mallo Novegil, Cabral, Fontas, Castro Otto, Hernandez, Fernandez, Krohn-Dehli (Radoja - 67'), Orellana, Larrivey (Dias de Oliveira 71'), Agudo Duran. Booked: Krohn-Dehli, Duran. Sent off: Orellana. Subs not used: Mina Lorenzo, Lopez Sanchez, Blanco, Bongonda, Gomez Sola. Barcelona: Bravo, Dani Alves, Pique, Mathieu, Adriano, Rafinha (Xavi 58'), Busquets, Iniesta (Pedro 75'), Messi, Suarez (Rakitic 85'), Neymar. Subs not used: Ter Stegen, Montoya, Bartra, Sergi. Goals: Mathieu 73' Booked: Suarez. Ref: Inaki Vicandi Garrido. Att: 23,731. This gritty, barely-deserved triumph helped Barcelona stay four points ahead of Real Madrid at the top of La Liga, after Ancelotti’s side's almost-harrowing 9-1 demolition of Granada. Celta Vigo’s aggressive pressing nearly paid dividends, but their hard-work and effort counted for nothing thanks to Mathieu’s goal. Their frustration manifested itself in a bizarre way, with Fabian Orellana sent off for throwing a lump of turf at Sergio Busquets. For some reason Sergio Alvarez, Celta Vigo's goalkeeper, is kryptonite for Barcelona's attacking trident, as they also failed to beat him in 90 minutes at the Camp Nou earlier this season. After Barcelona's Halloween nightmare against Celta Vigo, the directive from Luis Enrique here was not to leave with egg on their faces on Easter Sunday. Barcelona's own website stated that 'a dose of retribution' was in order, after the 1-0 defeat by Eduardo Berizzo’s side in late autumn. Before the game Spanish media wondered if the international break had happened at just the wrong time for Barcelona and just the right time for Real Madrid – something reflected in Madrid’s big win at lunchtime. The Frenchman wheels away in celebration of his second half header at the Balaidos Stadium. Gerard Pique (right) and Sergio Busquets join the French defender in celebration of his goal. With Los Blancos in disarray, a couple of weeks spent healing wounds away from the Santiago Bernabeu seemed an agreeable plan, while Barcelona's momentum was disrupted. Jordi Alba was injured playing for Spain, so Adriano Correia started in his stead. Messi, meanwhile, was dragged round the United States with Argentina, sidelined because of an inflamed foot which left him unable to put his boots on. He managed to do that here, but his presence was barely noticed on the pitch. With rival Cristiano Ronaldo scoring an incredible five goals earlier, Messi was left frustrated in his quest for the golden boot, with the Madrid man four strikes ahead of him on 36. Luis Enrique hasn't shown himself to be the sentimental type, but the former Celta Vigo manager gave Rafinha Alcantara a rare start against the team which he played for, both before moving to Barcelona at 13, and last season on loan. However, the midfielder failed to impress and made way for the legendary Xavi early in the second half. Mathieu (left) is congratulated by team-mates Lionel Messi and Neymar (right) after his goal. Javier Mascherano was suspended for accumulating too many yellow cards, as is his wont, but luckily for Barcelona Busquets was fit enough to start for the first time in over a month. Alvarez turned in the display of his life at the Camp Nou and Barcelona's attacking trident must have worried it was going to happen again, when he made a brilliant diving stop to deny Lionel Messi. Profligacy was an issue in that 1-0 defeat too, which we were reminded of when Neymar slashed the rebound high and wide. Los Celestes had made the early running themselves and Chilean goalkeeper Claudio Bravo, who boasts the best defensive record in La Liga, was down quickly to deny Joaquin Larrivey at his near post. It was Larrivey that put the first goal of the season past Bravo at the Camp Nou and he was determined not to let the Celta forward in again. With Messi quiet, it was down to the other two prongs of Barcelona's trident to try and make inroads. Neither were successful. Fabian Orellana was shown a red card for throwing a chunk of grass in the direction of Sergio Busquets. The lump of turf strikes Busquets in the neck after tempers reached boiling point. Neymar antagonised the Celta Vigo fans as he drew several fouls, but the Barcelona ones too with his incredible wastefulness. To watch him in recent weeks is to see a different player to the one that dismantled La Liga defences earlier in the season. His first touch was frequently poor, his passes off-target. Suarez, meanwhile, went down in the box looking for a penalty under an arm from Gustavo Cabral, but far too little contact to actually tumble. He was then booked on the stroke of half-time for a dive, although this time he has been charged into. The one opportunity Suarez got he hit hard and true, stinging the palms of Alvarez. But Celta Vigo were on top and Nolito was getting the better of Dani Alves time and time again. Maybe the Brazilian's mind is elsewhere, with his contract expiring in the summer, but physically he seems less capable too. Orellana (right) leaves the field after referee Inaki Vicandi Garrido brandishes a red card. The Barcelona players surround referee following a controversial decision. One horrendous defensive mix-up left Nolito charging for the ball with Bravo. The keeper got his foot to it before colliding with the Celta Vigo man, but the fans screamed for a penalty, unsuccessfully. The offside flag being raised against Orellana led to a Celta goal being ruled out, but the best chance fell to Larrivey before the interval. Orellana cut the ball neatly across the box but the striker, unmarked, nine yards out, lacked composure, hacking at it and sending it into the Vigo night sky. Barcelona continued to struggle, with Neymar’s goal harshly ruled out for offside and a shanked Alves shot the only efforts to their credit. Messi and Neymar react after another missed opportunity during a frustrating evening for the duo. Then came Pique’s tackle on Charles, with the defender making a super-human effort to get back and deny the striker. Celta Vigo were almost instantly punished for it, with Mathieu breaking the deadlock. Barcelona couldn’t kill the game, even after Orellana’s late sending off, with Messi scooping the ball over Alvarez but inches over the crossbar too. It didn’t matter; they held on to earn the three points and maintain the four-point lead over Real Madrid that they started the week with. And one game less for each side to play. It’s not pretty, it’s not ‘the Barca way’, but if Enrique lifts La Liga, nobody will be worrying about that. Neymar (right) fights for the ball against Celtais Andreu Fontas during the La Liga clash.

Barcelona struggle to 1-0 La Liga victory against Celta Vigo. Jeremy Mathieu gave Barcelona 1-0 lead with second half header. Orellana shown red card for throwing grass at Sergio Busquets. Luis Suarez shown a yellow card for diving by referee Inaki Vicandi Garrido.

Article: A university rowing team found themselves caught up in the crossfire when hundreds of flying fish mounted an attack. The first year students at Washington University were practising at Creve Coeur Lake in Missouri when the giant Asian Carp decided to strike. The St. Louis freshman men’s crew were captured on video rowing under a bridge by filmmaker Benjamin Rosenbaum, as he walks up the dock to greet them. The first year students at Washington University were rowing at Creve Coeur Lake in Missouri. Initially everything appears to be calm, until slight splashes can be seen rippling in the water around the boat. The filmmaker lets out a laugh as the ripples get larger and more frequent and fish can be seen leaping from the water. Suddenly all hell breaks loose and without any real warning hundreds of fish jump from the water and hurl themselves at the boat.

The filmmaker laughs at his fellow students as hundreds of fish leap at them from the water. The filmmaker continues to laugh as the students on the boat scream and the shield themselves from the carp. Fish can also be seen jumping into a small boat that overtakes the rowers and quickly speeds out of shot. Eventually the water begins calming once again and less of the fish emerge from the water as the boat comes in to dock. Asian carp are known for getting easily frightened by boats and leaping from water. The water becomes calm again as the majority of fish stop jumping when the boat reaches the dock. The video concludes with the video maker walking around to the boat and filming the individual crewmen, who each look wet and bemused. Asian carp are known for getting easily frightened by boats and reacting by leaping from the water. They have the ability to grow to 100lbs in mass and to jump as high as 10ft in the air and numerous boaters have received injuries on account of collisions with the fish.

Article: (CNN)As goes Walmart, so goes the nation? Everyone from Apple CEO Tim Cook to the head of the NCAA slammed religious freedom laws being considered in several states this week, warning that they would open the door to discrimination against gay and lesbian customers. But it was the opposition from Walmart, the ubiquitous retailer that dots the American landscape, that perhaps resonated most deeply, providing the latest evidence of growing support for gay rights in the heartland. Walmart's staunch criticism of a religious freedom law in its home state of Arkansas came after the company said in February it would boost pay for about 500,000 workers well above the federal minimum wage. Taken together, the company is emerging as a bellwether for shifting public opinion on hot-button political issues that divide conservatives and liberals. And some prominent Republicans are urging the party to take notice. Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, who famously called on the GOP to "be the party of Sam's Club, not just the country club," told CNN that Walmart's actions "foreshadow where the Republican Party will need to move." "The Republican Party will have to better stand for" ideas on helping the middle class, said Pawlenty, the head of the Financial Services Roundtable, a Washington lobbying group for the finance industry. The party's leaders must be "willing to put forward ideas that will help modest income workers, such as a reasonable increase in the minimum wage, and prohibit discrimination in things such as jobs, housing, public accommodation against gays and lesbians." Walmart, which employs more than 50,000 people in Arkansas, emerged victorious on Wednesday. Hours after the company's CEO, Doug McMillon, called on Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson to veto the bill, the governor held a news conference and announced he would not sign the legislation unless its language was fixed. Walmart's opposition to the religious freedom law once again puts the company at odds with many in the Republican Party, which the company's political action committee has tended to support. In 2004, the Walmart PAC gave around $2 million to Republicans versus less than $500,000 to Democrats, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. That gap has grown less pronounced in recent years. In 2014, the PAC spent about $1.3 million to support Republicans and around $970,000 for Democrats. It has been a gradual transformation for Walmart. In 2011, the company bulked up its nondiscrimination policies by adding protections for gender identity. Two years later, the company announced that it would start offering health insurance benefits to same-sex partners of employees starting in 2014. Retail experts say Walmart's evolution on these issues over the years is partly a reflection of its diverse consumer base, as well as a recognition of the country's increasingly progressive views of gay equality (support for same-sex marriage is at a new high of 59%, according to a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll). "It's easy for someone like a Chick-fil-A to take a really polarizing position," said Dwight Hill, a partner at the retail consulting firm McMillanDoolittle. "But in the world of the largest retailer in the world, that's very different." Hill added: Same-sex marriage, "while divisive, it's becoming more common place here within the U.S., and the businesses by definition have to follow the trend of their customer." The backlash over the religious freedom measures in Indiana and Arkansas this week is shining a bright light on the broader business community's overwhelming support for workplace policies that promote gay equality. After Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, a Republican, signed his state's religious freedom bill into law, CEOs of companies big and small across the country threatened to pull out of the Hoosier state. The resistance came from business leaders of all political persuasions, including Bill Oesterle, CEO of the business-rating website Angie's List and a one-time campaign manager for former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels. Oesterle announced that his company would put plans on hold to expand its footprint in Indianapolis in light of the state's passage of the religious freedom act. NASCAR, scheduled to hold a race in Indianapolis this summer, also spoke out against the Indiana law. "What we're seeing over the past week is a tremendous amount of support from the business community who are standing up and are sending that equality is good for business and discrimination is bad for business," said Jason Rahlan, spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign. The debate has reached presidential politics. National Republicans are being forced to walk the fine line of protecting religious liberties and supporting nondiscrimination. Likely GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush initially backed Indiana's religious freedom law and Pence, but moderated his tone a few days later. The former Florida governor said Wednesday that Indiana could have taken a "better" and "more consensus-oriented approach." "By the end of the week, Indiana will be in the right place," Bush said, a reference to Pence's promise this week to fix his state's law in light of the widespread backlash. Others in the GOP field are digging in. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, the only officially declared Republican presidential candidate, said Wednesday that he had no interest in second-guessing Pence and lashed out at the business community for opposing the law. "I think it is unfortunate that large companies today are listening to the extreme left wing agenda that is driven by an aggressive gay marriage agenda," Cruz said. Meanwhile, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who previously served on Walmart's board of directors, called on Hutchinson to veto the Arkansas bill, saying it would "permit unfair discrimination" against the LGBT community. Jay Chesshir, CEO of the Little Rock Regional Chamber of Commerce in Arkansas, welcomed Hutchinson's pledge on Wednesday to seek changes to his state's bill. He said businesses are not afraid to wade into a politically controversial debate to ensure inclusive workplace policies. "When it comes to culture and quality of life, businesses are extremely interested in engaging in debate simply because it impacts its more precious resource -- and that's its people," Chesshir said. "Therefore, when issues arise that have negative or positive impact on those things, then the business community will again speak and speak loudly."

Article: In the aftermath of Sunday's derby disaster the talk among fans was of summer incomings to reboot a blue machine that, all-of-a-sudden, looks as outdated as a Commodore 64. Then there is the inevitable speculation over the future of under-fire manager Manuel Pellegrini. But the biggest challenge for Manchester City this summer could be keeping hold of something they already have. Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero looks on dejected during the defeat by United at Old Trafford. The afternoon started so well for Aguero and City when he opened the scoring after just eight minutes. Aguero celebrates his 99th goal for Manchester City with David Silva as De Gea looks dejected. It may have gone largely unnoticed in the carnage at Old Trafford but there was an important landmark for the brilliant Sergio Aguero that deserves to be recognised. The aftermath of a crushing derby defeat at the old enemy may not be the place for jelly and ice-cream but the Argentine's tremendous feat of scoring 100 goals in just 158 appearances should be cause for celebration. Take a minute to think where City would have been without that century. Remember THAT title-winning goal against QPR in 2012? Most, in that situation, would have put their foot through the ball as soon as it arrived from Mario Balotelli. Not Kun. The man who takes his nickname from a cartoon character had City fans believing in fairy tales when he feigned a shot to open up space before firing home probably the biggest goal in the club's long history. That calm head, that powerful shot and that unnerving ability to find the target are what City paid what now looks like a bargain £38m for in 2011. Aguero netted his 100th goal for City in the 89th minute but there was no cause for celebration. The Argentine strikes in injury time against QPR to win Manchester City the title in 2012. Aguero celebrates with Edin Dzeko after that goal when City scored twice in injury time to win title. Aguero is settled in Manchester and signed a new five-year deal only last August. However, he now has to think of himself. If the unthinkable happens and City slip outside the top four will one of the best players in the world be happy at a season without showcasing his talents on the Champions League stage? There are admirers. Real Madrid and Barcelona are both fans. Should either register an interest City would face a desperate battle to keep hold of their star man. While a move to Madrid may come with an enticing caveat in the shape of Gareth Bale, the loss of Aguero would be exceptionally difficult to recover from. Where else do you get those goals from? While it is too early in his City career to pass judgement it would appear that the burden would be too much for Wilfried Bony's broad shoulders. Wilfried Bony has only scored once in five appearances since joining City from Swansea in January. City's ageing squad is in need of a major overhaul in the summer. Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba is a potential target as the City owner prepares to open the cheque book. The former Swansea City man, who cost just £10m less than Aguero, has failed to hit the ground running since his January move and has scored only once in five appearances. The powers-that-be would no doubt have to open their chequebook but who would come to an Aguero-less City? And, should they sleepwalk out of the top four, who would dream of coming to a club without Champions League football? The likes of Paul Pogba and Raheem Sterling are potential targets. Sportsmail understands discussions have already taken place with a number of new additions. But will they also want to come to a club shorn of its idol? It is a big question and one that City will be desperate not to have to discover the answer to. Liverpool contract rebel Raheem Sterling could also be on any list of summer targets. Manuel Pellegrini is facing the sack even if Manchester City qualify for the Champions League. There are others to ponder. Does Pellegrini stay? And what share of the blame do executives Ferran Soriano and Txiki Begiristain take? Are they at fault for spending the best part of £200m since 2012 without really strengthening the team or does Pellegrini carry the can? With Financial Fair Play sanctions hurting, it was essential that City got bang for the buck. In reality they barely had a whimper. The pile on the in-tray on chairman Khaldoon al Mubarak's desk seems to be getting taller every week. It is essential that keeping Aguero is top of that ever-growing list or else that ageing blue machine risks heading for an even bigger crash.

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence.
Manchester City were beaten 4-2 by Manchester United at Old Trafford. Defeat leaves City fourth in Premier League, four points behind Man United. Man City desperately need to strengthen an ageing squad in the summer. And it remains to be see whether City will stick with Manuel Pellegrini. But the biggest challenge could be keeping hold of Sergio Aguero. Argentine scored a brace against United to take his tally for City to 100.

Article: (CNN)On May 28, 2014, some 7,000 people gathered in a stadium in China's northwestern Xinjiang region. But they had not come to watch the local football team or any other grand sporting event. Instead, the authorities paraded scores of prisoners dressed in orange jumpsuits. Armed soldiers guarded the exits. In the patently unfair, open air trial that followed, 55 people were found guilty of a range of offenses linked to violent attacks in the region and jailed. Three were sentenced to death. The public mass sentencing was part a China's "Strike Hard" campaign against unrest in Xinjiang, a campaign the government claims was launched to combat "terrorism" and "separatism." But it was also indicative of a trend that was starkly evident last year around the world -- governments using the death penalty in a misguided, and often cynical, attempt to tackle crime and terrorism. Today, Amnesty International releases its annual review of the death penalty worldwide.  Much of it makes for grim reading. In Pakistan, the government lifted a six-year moratorium on the execution of civilians in the wake of the horrific Taliban attack on a school in Peshawar in December. More than 60 people have been put to death since, and the government has threatened to send thousands more death row prisoners to the gallows.  Iran and Iraq executed people for "terrorism," and other countries expanded the scope of capital crimes in their penal codes. In a year when abhorrent summary executions by armed groups were branded on the global consciousness as never before, governments are themselves resorting to more executions in a knee-jerk reaction to terrorism. Other countries made use of executions in similarly flawed attempts to address -- or appear to address -- crime rates. Jordan ended an eight-year moratorium in December, putting 11 murder convicts to death, with the government saying it was a move to end a surge in violent crime.  In Indonesia, authorities announced plans to execute mainly drug traffickers to tackle a public safety "national emergency." Six people have already been executed this year. A sharp spike in death sentences recorded in 2014 -- up more than 500 on the previous year -- can also be attributed to governments using the death penalty as a political tool.  The rise was largely because of developments in Egypt and Nigeria, where courts imposed hundreds of death sentences in the context of internal political instability or crime and armed conflict. The simple fact is that governments using the death penalty to tackle crime and security threats are deceiving themselves or the public or both. There is no evidence that the threat of execution is more of a deterrent to crime than a prison sentence, as United Nations and other studies have repeatedly confirmed. It is high time that world leaders stop using the death penalty as an easy way out when times get tough. At Amnesty International, we have campaigned for an end to the death penalty for decades. Thankfully, most of the world now appears to agree with us. The numbers speak for themselves. In 1945 when the United Nations was founded, only eight countries had abolished the death penalty. Today, 140 states are abolitionist in law or practice. Last year, we recorded executions in 22 countries, down by almost a half from 20 years ago. Despite the troubling developments we recorded last year, there was still much good news to be found. The number of executions recorded around the world dropped significantly in 2014 compared with the previous year, from 778 to 607. This number does not include China, where more people are put to death than the rest of the world put together, but with death penalty statistics treated as a state secret, the true figure is impossible to determine. Executions were recorded in only three countries in sub-Saharan Africa -- Equatorial Guinea, Somalia and Sudan -- and the number of people put to death went down by more than a quarter. The Americas continued to be execution-free, apart from the United States. Those governments that still execute need to realize that they are on the wrong side of history. They must join the vast majority of countries which have dropped the ultimate cruel punishment. Fighting for an end to the death penalty remains an uphill task, but all of us must try to make the world free of this punishment. With determination, I know that we can achieve this goal.

Article: Jenson Button believes McLaren now have their rivals in their sights ahead of this weekend's Chinese Grand Prix. After starting the new Formula One season in Australia with a severe lack of pace, McLaren and new power-unit supplier Honda made significant progress a fortnight later in Malaysia. Although both Button and team-mate Fernando Alonso retired during the race at the Sepang International Circuit, the duo at least discovered the car was competitive alongside other midfield runners. Jenson Button looks on in the garage during final practice for last month's Malaysian Grand Prix. That came as a pleasant surprise to Button, who is now hoping further steps have been taken going into this weekend's race in Shanghai. 'Obviously we want to finish a race, but seeing improvement in pace was much more important,' said Button. 'Yes, we both had failures, but I'd rather that with us pushing and trying to get more power out of the car than trotting around at the back and simply getting to the end. 'To be able to race other cars, and see the Red Bulls until a long way into the race, was good. 'We would probably have been 20 seconds behind them. I know they're not quick, but that is a good step forward for us. Button returns to the McLaren garage after retiring during the race at the Sepang circuit. 'Right now we're comparing ourselves with the Force Indias, Saubers and Lotuses. 'We were quicker than Force India; the Sauber was on the same sort of pace, and the Lotus wasn't that much quicker. 'Fighting with the pack is important for me. It's what I enjoy and hopefully race by race we'll start picking them off.' Despite the positives, Button acknowledges the entire team, including Honda,'still has a long way to go'. British driver Button in action before he retired from the Malaysian Grand Prix. Button added: 'We need and want more downforce to fight with the guys around us, and we still have a lot to do with the power unit, but our basic car is good. 'If you look at our high-speed pace, compared to the Force India and Sauber, then we are much stronger. 'So we're moving in the right direction, and I'm already surprised we are racing cars. It's great to see.' Part of the reasoning behind McLaren's improvement in Malaysia, in comparison to Australia, was the high temperatures which suited the car. McLaren driver Fernando Alonso (left) drives ahead of team-mate Button in Kuala Lumpur. Button appreciates the cooler air in Shanghai could have an effect. The 35-year-old said: 'There is a feeling the expected cooler weather will make it harder to generate tyre temperature. 'That could mean any progress we make doesn't necessarily translate to a lap-time benefit. 'But there is definitely progress being made, and it's great to be able to play a role in helping move the whole team forwards. 'It'll be fascinating to see how much change we can effect over the forthcoming races.'

Jenson Button and Fernando Alonso both retired in Malaysia last month. Button says, however, that McLaren are moving in the right direction. The Chinese Grand Prix takes place in Shanghai this weekend.

Article: Marseille, France (CNN)The French prosecutor leading an investigation into the crash of Germanwings Flight 9525 insisted Wednesday that he was not aware of any video footage from on board the plane. Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin told CNN that "so far no videos were used in the crash investigation." He added, "A person who has such a video needs to immediately give it to the investigators." Robin's comments follow claims by two magazines, German daily Bild and French Paris Match, of a cell phone video showing the harrowing final seconds from on board Germanwings Flight 9525 as it crashed into the French Alps. All 150 on board were killed. Paris Match and Bild reported that the video was recovered from a phone at the wreckage site. The two publications described the supposed video, but did not post it on their websites. The publications said that they watched the video, which was found by a source close to the investigation. "One can hear cries of 'My God' in several languages," Paris Match reported. "Metallic banging can also be heard more than three times, perhaps of the pilot trying to open the cockpit door with a heavy object.  Towards the end, after a heavy shake, stronger than the others, the screaming intensifies. Then nothing." "It is a very disturbing scene," said Julian Reichelt, editor-in-chief of Bild online. An official with France's accident investigation agency, the BEA, said the agency is not aware of any such video. Lt. Col. Jean-Marc Menichini, a French Gendarmerie spokesman in charge of communications on rescue efforts around the Germanwings crash site, told CNN that the reports were "completely wrong" and "unwarranted." Cell phones have been collected at the site, he said, but that they "hadn't been exploited yet." Menichini said he believed the cell phones would need to be sent to the Criminal Research Institute in Rosny sous-Bois, near Paris, in order to be analyzed by specialized technicians working hand-in-hand with investigators. But none of the cell phones found so far have been sent to the institute, Menichini said. Asked whether staff involved in the search could have leaked a memory card to the media, Menichini answered with a categorical "no." Reichelt told "Erin Burnett: Outfront" that he had watched the video and stood by the report, saying Bild and Paris Match are "very confident" that the clip is real. He noted that investigators only revealed they'd recovered cell phones from the crash site after Bild and Paris Match published their reports. "That is something we did not know before.... Overall we can say many things of the investigation weren't revealed by the investigation at the beginning," he said. What was mental state of Germanwings co-pilot? German airline Lufthansa confirmed Tuesday that co-pilot Andreas Lubitz had battled depression years before he took the controls of Germanwings Flight 9525, which he's accused of deliberately crashing last week in the French Alps. Lubitz told his Lufthansa flight training school in 2009 that he had a "previous episode of severe depression," the airline said Tuesday. Email correspondence between Lubitz and the school discovered in an internal investigation, Lufthansa said, included medical documents he submitted in connection with resuming his flight training. The announcement indicates that Lufthansa, the parent company of Germanwings, knew of Lubitz's battle with depression, allowed him to continue training and ultimately put him in the cockpit. Lufthansa, whose CEO Carsten Spohr previously said Lubitz was 100% fit to fly, described its statement Tuesday as a "swift and seamless clarification" and said it was sharing the information and documents -- including training and medical records -- with public prosecutors. Spohr traveled to the crash site Wednesday, where recovery teams have been working for the past week to recover human remains and plane debris scattered across a steep mountainside. He saw the crisis center set up in Seyne-les-Alpes, laid a wreath in the village of Le Vernet, closer to the crash site, where grieving families have left flowers at a simple stone memorial. Menichini told CNN late Tuesday that no visible human remains were left at the site but recovery teams would keep searching. French President Francois Hollande, speaking Tuesday, said that it should be possible to identify all the victims using DNA analysis by the end of the week, sooner than authorities had previously suggested. In the meantime, the recovery of the victims' personal belongings will start Wednesday, Menichini said. Among those personal belongings could be more cell phones belonging to the 144 passengers and six crew on board. Check out the latest from our correspondents. The details about Lubitz's correspondence with the flight school during his training were among several developments as investigators continued to delve into what caused the crash and Lubitz's possible motive for downing the jet. A Lufthansa spokesperson told CNN on Tuesday that Lubitz had a valid medical certificate, had passed all his examinations and "held all the licenses required." Earlier, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office in Dusseldorf, Christoph Kumpa, said medical records reveal Lubitz suffered from suicidal tendencies at some point before his aviation career and underwent psychotherapy before he got his pilot's license. Kumpa emphasized there's no evidence suggesting Lubitz was suicidal or acting aggressively before the crash. Investigators are looking into whether Lubitz feared his medical condition would cause him to lose his pilot's license, a European government official briefed on the investigation told CNN on Tuesday. While flying was "a big part of his life," the source said, it's only one theory being considered. Another source, a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation, also told CNN that authorities believe the primary motive for Lubitz to bring down the plane was that he feared he would not be allowed to fly because of his medical problems. Lubitz's girlfriend told investigators he had seen an eye doctor and a neuropsychologist, both of whom deemed him unfit to work recently and concluded he had psychological issues, the European government official said. But no matter what details emerge about his previous mental health struggles, there's more to the story, said Brian Russell, a forensic psychologist. "Psychology can explain why somebody would turn rage inward on themselves about the fact that maybe they weren't going to keep doing their job and they're upset about that and so they're suicidal," he said. "But there is no mental illness that explains why somebody then feels entitled to also take that rage and turn it outward on 149 other people who had nothing to do with the person's problems." Germanwings crash compensation: What we know. Who was the captain of Germanwings Flight 9525?

CNN's Frederik Pleitgen, Pamela Boykoff, Antonia Mortensen, Sandrine Amiel and Anna-Maja Rappard contributed to this report.

Article: It may have been the first time in 41 years that a jockey had won back-to-back Grand Nationals – but the most emotional man at Aintree yesterday seemed to be Mike Tindall, whose horse Monbeg Dude was a fast-finishing third. The former England rugby star and husband of Zara Phillips, bought the horse for £12,000 at auction after a boozy dinner and was overcome by the 40-1 outsider’s performance. After a whopping £105,500 payday he tweeted ‘Holy s***, I’m lost for words and emotions. All I can say is yes the dude!!!!!’ Scroll down for video. Pay day: The former England rugby star tweeted ‘Holy s***, I’m lost for words and emotions' What a dude: It's tense, then Zara and Mike explode with emotion as Monbeg Dude finishes. After her husband Mike Tindall bought the horse, Zara (pictured), an experienced rider, called him an idiot. After he bought the horse Zara called him an idiot, but she was there with him, cheering the horse home as it almost caught the winner Many Clouds and second placed Saint Are in a thrilling finish. Saint Are (25/1) came second and Monbeg Dude (40/1) placed third. There were huge cheers from the crowd as the 39 horses who started the race set off at 4.15pm to tackle the 30 fences over two laps. Several horses fell throughout the four mile, three-and-a-half furlong trek but it was Many Clouds ridden by Irish jockey Leighton Aspell which came out on top.

Article: The Philadelphia Office of Transportation aims to get the city's pedestrians off their phones by sending a man in bubble wrap out to spread their safety message to the people. A video from the office features characters in'safety suits' including Bubbleman, a 'Fashionista' wrapped in the poppable material and a young man in flashing lights. The campaigners are seen talking to residents about the dangers of not looking up from one's phone, including the fact that 37 people died from being hit by cars last year. While other safety programs are directed at keeping motorists from hitting and killing pedestrians, the City of Brotherly Love's is focused on those walking around the city. Scroll down for video. A video from the Philadelphia Office of Transportation shows characters such as Bubbleman talking to residents about the dangers of phone usage while walking around the city. A character called the Fashionista (center, in bubble wrap) said 'jaywalking is the new catwalking' as part of a snarky reminder to pedestrians to be aware of their surroundings. It is aimed at 18 to 25-year-olds who the campaign says are most likely to be hit by cars while on their phones. More than 40 per cent of drivers who hit pedestrians and 30 per cent of the 1,800 pedestrians that are hit are 18 to 34, Mayor's office planner Ema Yamamoto said, according to Plan Philly. The snarky video's Safety Suiter characters say they 'can't think of any other way to not get hit by a car' besides wearing their ridiculous costumes. Another character, the Fashionista, says that 'jaywalking is the new catwalking'. A 'Tech guy' in a helmet with flashing lights on his body also gave information to residents, including that 37 pedestrians died last year. The SafetySuiters (played by different actors) are part of a campaign to drive down pedestrian deaths among young people, based around a series of slogans including 'It's road safety, not rocket science' Large signs in Philadelphia that say 'Pick Your Head Up'  are also part of the bid to end phone use, which is thought to contribute to five people being hit per day. The campaign, which has more slogans such as  'It's road safety, not rocket science' and 'jaywalking can lead to not walking', also includes signs meant for drivers on its website. One says 'Cars have bumpers, people don't'. Some have criticized the Philadelphia campaign for focuses too much on pedestrians and blaming them for getting hit by cars. Twitter user JonasMcivitas called the ads 'tone deaf'. 'Certainly everybody is responsible for paying attention to their surroundings. But a car can kill people. Drivers should be a million times more the focus of this campaign because a driver bears the responsibility for not killing people,' local planner Victoria Harris said. Some have found Philadelphia's safety slogans such as 'jaywalking can lead to notwalking' to be 'tone deaf' Some pedestrian advocates and urban planners have criticized certain safety education efforts for placing blame on those who are hit by cars. Above, a campaign in Montgomery County, Maryland. The pedestrian safety coordinator for Montgomery County said that the graphic campaign was to help humanize pedestrian victims of accidents. Yamamoto said that the new campaign was simply explaining good behavior for smartphone users, who 'need to be aware of their surroundings'. Backlash against the campaign follows a similarly controversial public education effort in Montgomery County, Maryland, outside of Washington DC. Posters with tire marks over young people's faces were seen as blaming them for their own deaths, though the pedestrian safety coordinator told WTOP that the Street Smart campaign was an attempt to humanize victims. New York City's Vision Zero campaign against accidents, which has included speed limit reductions, focuses on drivers. The metropolis saw 132 pedestrians die last year, the lowest number on record, according to the New York Times.

Article: Michael Vaughan has re-affirmed his interest in taking on the newly created role of director of England cricket - but only if he feels he can make a difference. A new post has been opened after Paul Downton lost his job as the England and Wales Cricket Board's managing director of cricket on Wednesday, with the job title also scrapped. Instead ECB chief executive Tom Harrison is keen to have Downton's replacement focus solely on performances, rather than administration duties, which has brought a number of former England captains into the fray. Michael Vaughan has re-affirmed his interest in taking on the newly created role of director of England cricket. Ashes 2005 winning skipper Vaughan is among the early frontrunners for the new role with the ECB. Ashes 2005 winning skipper Vaughan is among the early frontrunners although the former Yorkshire batsman admitted in his column with the Daily Telegraph he would need to know more about the role before committing. Vaughan, who since retirement has been a pundit and commentator for numerous media outlets, said: 'It will take honesty and unity to make a change. In (incoming ECB chairman) Colin Graves and Tom Harrison we have a chance to change English cricket and admit our problems. 'Let us finally do it. Stop looking at what your own county needs and ask what is best for English cricket moving forward and what is right for the England team to sustain a proper period of success. Paul Downton lost his job as the England and Wales Cricket Board's managing director of cricket. 'For the first time since retiring six years ago I am open to a conversation with the ECB. I am passionate about English cricket. I love the game and I always want England to move forward and be successful. 'I have a vision for the game and I think I will be one of many ex-players who will be more than willing to talk to the ECB to see what exactly the role is and how much influence it will wield over the future structure of our game. 'The brief has to be wider and more powerful than Paul's to have any real impact on England.'

Article: (CNN)The Rev. Robert H. Schuller, California televangelist and founder of the television ministry "Hour of Power," died Thursday, according to his family. He was 88 years old. Schuller, also the founder of Crystal Cathedral megachurch, had been diagnosed with esophageal cancer in August 2013, a release from "Hour of Power" said. "My father-in-law passed away peacefully early this morning. He was a great Dad and a great man of God," said Schuller's daughter-in-law, Donna Schuller, in a Twitter message. Schuller's life followed an almost Shakespearean arc. He was born in a Iowa farmhouse without running water and longed to preach from his earliest days. In his autobiography, "Prayer: My Soul's Adventure with God," he described standing alone by a river and picturing himself delivering sermons to a rapt congregation. After attending a Hope College and Western Theological Seminary in Michigan, he met his wife of more than 60 years, Arvella, while preaching at her church (she was the organist). With their young family in tow, the Schullers caravanned west to California, where he rented a drive-in theater and preached from the roof of the snack bar. It was beneath the dignity of Christian ministry, some local pastors huffed. The "passion pits" where teenagers necked was no place for the gospel. Schuller was undeterred, and he quickly outgrew the drive-in. He called the explosive growth of his tiny congregation a "miracle," though his many mainstream critics had other names for it. His confident, breezy version of Christianity -- too breezy, by some estimations -- drew hordes of seekers and lapsed Christians who were put off by the hellfire fulminations of many post-War American preachers. Schuller sold a softer, gentler message, which borrowed heavily, he acknowledged, from the father of the feel-good gospel, Norman Vincent Peale. He preached not to convert or condemn people, but to encourage them, a sentiment he called "possibility thinking." People loved it. "Evangelicalism at its best wants to be innovative and reach people," said Timothy Larsen, a professor of Christian thought at Wheaton College in Illinois. "And Schuller was a master at that." "What he got right is that the gospel is good news," Larsen continued. "And he preached an uplifting message about personal transformation and uplift and hope." Some of Schuller's favored phrases, though, struck others as cornpone Christianity. "Turn your hurt into a halo?" said Randall Balmer, a professor of American religious history at Dartmouth College, citing one such phrase. "That's pretty weak tea." Still, Balmer gives Schuller some credit. "It may be bad theology, but it's brilliant marketing." In 1970, Schuller began broadcasting "Hour of Power," believed to be one of the first, if not the very first, Sunday service to be shown regularly on television. With his genial smile, priestly robes and gray hair, he looked and talked like a guy who wanted nothing more than to see his flock succeed. The show, which ran for decades, reached millions, making Schuller a televangelist before the term became tarnished by the sins of his many successors. Schuller's crowning achievement, at least architecturally, still stands in Orange County, California, though it is now owned by the Roman Catholic Church. The Crystal Cathedral, a great gleaming edifice with 10,000 glass panels, gave worshipers a look at the  clouds that house the heavens, while Schuller preached in the pulpit below. The message was clear to many: The road to the former ran through the latter. During the 1980s and 1990s, Schuller's star continued to rise, with presidents stopping by the Crystal Cathedral -- often during campaigns, it should be said -- and future megachurch pastors like Rick Warren and Bill Hybels seeking his advice. As Schuller aged, though, his family was beset by a succession scandal straight from the pages of "King Lear."  He tried to install his only son, Bobby Jr., as pastor of Crystal Cathedral. But the preaching styles of father and son were too different for the congregation -- measured at times at 10,000 strong -- to countenance. Bobby Schuller Jr. left "Hour of Power" and the pulpit at Crystal Cathedral after a short time. As the family searched for a new successor and tussled over finances, viewers and donations to the church and its television show dropped precipitously. Crystal Cathedral Ministries filed for bankruptcy in 2010, citing debts of more than $43 million, according to The Associated Press. Schuller's empire, which once soared as high as his glassy cathedral, had fallen to dust. Eventually, Schuller's grandson, also named Bobby, took over "Hour of Power," though at a different church. In a statement on Thursday, the younger Schuller recalled standing atop Crystal Cathedral's 12-story Tower of Hope with his grandfather as they surveyed the surrounding landscape. "You could see the whole world from there," he said. People we've lost in 2015. CNN's Stella Chan reported from Los Angeles.

Article: John Carver says his Newcastle players have a point to prove to themselves at Liverpool on Monday night. The Magpies are in danger of being sucked into what had previously seemed an unlikely relegation battle given their alarming run of form. Amid accusations of the team 'playing with their flip-flops on', United have lost four on the spin - scoring just once - and Carver admits he does not know where their next point is coming from. It is unlikely to arrive at Anfield, a venue at which they last won in 1994. They were beaten 1-0 by North-East rivals Sunderland seven days ago – a performance Carver labelled 'embarrassing' – and there was a showdown meeting at the club's training ground this week in which the head coach let his feelings be known. John Carver says his Newcastle players have a point to prove when they face Liverpool on Monday. Carver, though, is hoping that personal pride will kick in when they travel to Merseyside. 'Before they go out my message will be simple – 'You have a point to prove, but prove it for yourself, not for me, not for anybody else, but for yourself. You owe it for yourself',' he said. 'The meeting we had on Wednesday was non-negotiable. We've had meetings in the past where I like a two-way dialogue. 'But I got a few things off my chest and it was probably the first time I've been Mr Nasty. 'After the meeting we trained and there was a great response. That hurt me a little bit because I wanted to see that on Sunday. But at least I got something from them.' Carver said this week that owner Mike Ashley has promised to invest in the squad this summer and a major overhaul is expected – out-of-contract players such as Jonas Gutierrez, Ryan Taylor and Sammy Ameobi will be released, while the likes of Yoan Gouffran, Cheick Tiote, Moussa Sissoko and Papiss Cisse are also expected to move on. Newcastle in training earlier this week for their game against Liverpool on Monday in the Premier League. Moussa Sissoko (left), Vurnon Anita (centre) and Massadio Haidara (right) at a training session. However, the promise of such renovation has done little to appease fans who are organising a boycott ahead of next Sunday's visit of Spurs. Carver, in fairness, is caught in the middle of what is a toxic relationship between supporters and the club's hierarchy. And the 50-year-old admits he has been on the receiving end of criticism from fans. 'I have to accept what people say. As long as it is done the right way and in a constructive manner, I can accept that,' he said. Newcastle were beaten in last weekend's Tyne/Wear derby by Jermain Defoe's stunning volley. Carver has now seen his Newcastle team lose four in a row and fall into relegation danger. 'It would be easy to say, 'I've had enough, thanks'. I'm not going to do that and I have still got my enthusiasm. 'I can't hide from what happened on Sunday, and I won't hide from it. What I won't take is abuse, and certainly none of my family will take abuse. 'But I wanted to give this a go because I didn't want to have any regrets. I believe in my own ability and I believe if I have got the tools then I could do a good job and a successful job.'

Newcastle take on Liverpool on Monday night at Anfield. The Magpies have not won away at Liverpool since 1994. Newcastle have lost their last four games scoring just one goal. John Carver's side nine points clear of relegation zone in 13th place.

Article: Manchester City star have met up with more than 100 local schoolchildren for the unveiling of a 64metre mural depicting 'the football effect' at the club's Academy Stadium. Players including Vincent Kompany and Gael Clichy helped youngsters add the finishing touches to the design during a street party on Wednesday - alongside women's players Lucy Bronze and Emma Lipman and Mathias Bossaerts and Kelechi Iheanacho from the Elite Development Squad. The mural has been inspired by young City fans around the world to reflect the positive influence that the game has brought to their lives. Manchester-based artists groups Outhouse used the pictures to design the huge mural, which took almost four weeks to complete. Captain Vincent Kompany helps a young City fan put the finishing touches to the massive mural. The 64metre design covers the south edge of the Premier League champion's Academy Stadium. City stars joined around 100 local schoolchildren for a street party to unveil the mural. Among the images featured are scenes of football being played around the world, including night football, street football and disabled leagues, while the club's City Football Academy is at the centre of the design. Captain Kompany felt privileged to be a part of unveiling: 'It's been a special street party event today and the wall looks incredible. When Manchester City Women's and our EDS teams play at the Academy Stadium, our fans will be able to see City's history and future reflected in this wall,' he said. Kompany and women's player Lucy Bronze give the mural the thumbs up with some young fans. Gael Clichy was also at hand to pose for pictures with youngsters at the mural's unveiling. 'Being at the City Football Academy, in the heart of Manchester means that we have a greater bond with the community and the surrounding areas and today's event showed this connection in action.' The Premier League champions, along with sister clubs including New York City FC and Melbourne City FC, recently invested £400,000 into a charitable programme, Cityzens Giving, aimed at extending the 'football effect' to areas of need across the globe.

Article: Luis Suarez is quickly establishing himself in Barcelona folklore after impressing since his £75million move from Liverpool and the striker has revealed that years prior, he found himself sneaking into the Nou Camp. Speaking to Spanish radio station COPE, the forward spoke candidly about Real Madrid's interest in signing him and opened up about the infamous bite on Giorgio Chiellini during the World Cup. Suarez revealed that during a visit to his future club, he sneaked into the Nou Camp with his wife Sofia for a photo opportunity. Luis Suarez (9) has revealed that he once sneaked his way into the Nou Camp for a photograph. He said: 'It was not the first time that I came to Barcelona, it was the second. I went past the official store and saw it, but I did not go in because I didn't have money to buy anything. 'I was already going with Sofía and I remember that I saw an open door and I told her: 'Let's go'. 'You're crazy'. 'Come, just one photo'. 'No, no'. 'Yes, yes, yes. I'm going to go in'. I went in through the door that was open, she followed me and we started to run. 'We stood on the stairs and took a photo with all of the stadium behind us. I still haven't found the photo. Then we ran, and we were nervous. It was the only time that I had entered. My father-in-law managed to enter another time to see Argentina-Catalunya, on December 27.' The Uruguayan lit up the 'El Clasico' last month, where he scored the winner to send his side top of La Liga but he could have been playing for the opposition, if he'd not decided to move to Catalonia. The Uruguayan has been in fine form for Barcelona following his move and is becoming a fan's favourite. The forward admitted that Real Madrid were'very' interested in signing him but he only wanted Barca. Talk of a move to the Spanish capital had been rife during his years at Liverpool but Suarez revealed that there was only one club which caught his eye. He said: 'Madrid were very interested in me, but my dream was always Barcelona. When I heard the name of Barca, I did not hesitate at any moment.' Arguably Suarez's most famous, yet controversial moment, when he bit Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil and being banned for four-months. 'The bite on Chiellini was the worst moment of my career,' he said. 'I let myself down, my country, my wife and my children. The bites were partly my fault and partly [due to] the provocation of Ivanovic and Chiellini. Now they continue provoking me, but now I go or speak well. I am more intelligent.' Suarez admits that the bite was the worst moment of his career as he received a four-month playing ban. The attackers bite Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini during the 2014 World Cup group game last July.

Article: (CNN)Michele Bachmann is comparing President Obama to the co-pilot of the doomed Germanwings flight. "With his Iran deal, Barack Obama is for the 300 million souls of the United States what Andreas Lubitz was for the 150 souls on the German Wings flight - a deranged pilot flying his entire nation into the rocks," the Minnesota Republican and former representative wrote in a Facebook comment posted March 31. "After the fact, among the smoldering remains of American cities, the shocked survivors will ask, why did he do it?" Andreas Lubitz, the co-pilot of Germanwings Flight 9525, is accused by authorities of deliberately crashing the plane in the French Alps. He died in the crash along with 149 other crew and passengers. The motive of the March 24 crash is under investigation, though investigators are looking in to whether Lubitz feared a medical condition would cause him to lose his pilot's license. Many comments posted on her Facebook page blasted the former representative. Melissa Coca wrote, "Comparing this tragedy to anything is moronic and despicable." Michael J Pristash wrote, "Your allusion is so inappropriate and divisive, not to mention disrespectful on so many levels. Shame on you." Some also accused her of taking desperate measures to stay in the public eye. Lynda Anderson wrote, "Posting outrageous things in a pathetic attempt to stay relevant?" Negotiations are coming down to the wire between Iran, the United States and other nations on restricting Tehran's nuclear program to prevent the ability to develop an atomic bomb. One deadline passed Tuesday, but there is a June 30 deadline for a comprehensive deal -- with all technical and diplomatic impasses fully worked out. Bachmann is no stranger to voicing her opinion on the President's dealing with Iran, personally telling him to "bomb Iran" during the 2014 White House Christmas Party. "I turned to the president and I said, something to the effect of, 'Mr. President, you need to bomb the Iranian nuclear facilities, because if you don't, Iran will have a nuclear weapon on your watch and the course of world history will change,'" she told the Washington Free Beacon. The congresswoman, who sought the GOP presidential nomination in 2012, said Obama had a "condescending smile on his face and laughed at me." She said he told her: "Well Michele, it's just not that easy."

Article: Alec Stewart is intrigued to hear more about the newly-created role of England cricket director. The Surrey director of cricket insisted his focus is on his role at The Oval and he is yet to speak to anyone at the England and Wales Cricket Board about the position, which is to be introduced following the departure of Paul Downton as managing director. Stewart's fellow former England captains Andrew Strauss and Michael Vaughan have also been linked to the job. Alec Stewart admitted he has had no contact with the ECB over the  role of England cricket director. The England head coach, Peter Moores, would report to the cricket director, but Stewart is among the potential candidates awaiting full clarity of the responsibilities of the position. Vaughan and Strauss, too, have expressed a wish to learn the details of the job specification, which could come when incoming chairman Colin Graves starts work next month alongside new chief executive Tom Harrison. 'Until anyone sees the job spec - whether it's Vaughan, myself, Straussy, whoever it may be - you can't comment,' Stewart told Press Association. Stewart, who played 133 Tests and 170 ODIs for England, is in the frame to replace the axed Paul Downton. 'All I've said is I've done everything that's ever been asked of me as an England player and if England thought that I would be the right type of person for that role, whatever that role may be, then you'd be stupid not to look at it. 'I'm under contract here. (The) ECB would have to seek permission to speak to me via Surrey. 'This is a great job that I'm thoroughly enjoying here. I seriously think we're going to be going places over the next few years. That's what I'm concentrating on. Michael Vaughan is also among the leading candidates to take up the newly-created role with England. 'I can't underestimate what a great job this is. But you always want to be aware of other things that are going on.' Asked if he had had any informal or preliminary discussions with the ECB hierarchy, Stewart added: 'None whatsoever. My focus is very much here and if somebody from the ECB rings me I'll take their phone call or meet them, but that hasn't happened.'

Article: France's biggest handball star Nikola Karabatic will stand trial for fraud over his suspected involvement in an illegal betting case. Karabatic, a multiple world and Olympic gold medalist, and his younger brother Luka were among a group of players banned by the French league two years ago for betting on the result of a match in which their Montpellier club, which had already secured the title, lost to a struggling team. Karabatic's lawyer Michael Corbier told Sportsmail on Wednesday the trial will likely take place within months. French handball star Nikola Karabatic has been accused of match fixing along with 15 others. Former Montpellier ace competes for France in Handball World Cup match against Iceland in January. 'We would have preferred the charges to be thrown out, but we'll aim for a not-guilty verdict,' said Corbier. 'In theory he is facing five years in prison and a fine, but even a suspended sentence of just half an hour in jail would be too much.' Karabatic, who was briefly detained when the case emerged, now plays for Barcelona in the Spanish league. Karabatic leaves the Montpellier's courtroom after attending his appeal in October 2012. Other former or current Montpellier players including Mladen Bojinovic, Samuel Honrubia, Dragan Gagic, Primoz Prost, Issam Tej and Mickael Robin will also be tried. Karabatic has denied placing bets on the match that Montpellier lost 31-28 to Cesson-Rennes. Betting authority Francaise de Jeux reported an unusually high increase in betting at halftime in the match, raising suspicions and triggering a police investigation. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Article: Who has been Liverpool’s player of the season? Had you asked that question 12 months ago, the answer would have been glaring: Luis Suarez. For his 31 goals and his breathtaking displays, the accolade could only have gone to the Uruguayan. It was not, though, a case of him operating alone. Had it been a ‘normal’ season, Steven Gerrard, Daniel Sturridge, Philippe Coutinho and Raheem Sterling would all have been worthy recipients. But they were not the only contenders. Jordan Henderson was outstanding. Martin Skrtel was a big presence. Luis Suarez was clearly Liverpool's player of last season after the striker scored 31 goals in the campaign. Steven Gerrard (left) and Phillippe Coutinho (front) also played well as Liverpool's title tilt fell short. The Brazilian playmaker put in a real all-action display for his team. As well as scoring the winner, he had the most shots, most touches, the highest duel success, highest dribble completion, and the most tackles. Fast forward to the present and ask the same question: who has been Liverpool’s player of the season? There is no obvious candidate. Henderson, of course, would have his backers. The England international has excelled since the turn of the year, while Coutinho would command his share of the vote. Brendan Rodgers suggested after the Brazilian’s fabulous goal against Manchester City on March 1 he might be a contender for PFA Young Player of Year but, at times since, his flame has not flickered so brightly. Sterling had three blistering months when his goals were key to reviving fortunes. Emre Can has caught the eye since Christmas, while results have been better with Lucas Leiva in the team; Liverpool have only suffered three defeats in the 23 matches he has started. And that explains why Liverpool are where they are at the moment. There have been lots of satisfactory contributions, a few excellent, but there hasn’t been anywhere near the consistency of 12 months ago. Jordan Henderson has chipped in with some important goals and impressed with his boundless energy. Coutinho has again played well and won the game for Liverpool to send them into the FA Cup semi-finals. Coutinho has popped up with some important goals this season — five of his six strikes have earned Liverpool results (four wins and a draw). It is why they find themselves on the wrong side of the line for Champions League places and why they have made such heavy weather of this FA Cup campaign. For long periods here they flattered to deceive. Sterling saw little of the ball and Sturridge continued to show how out of form he is. The goals have dried up for Rodgers’ side over the course of the last month — they had only scored seven in their previous six matches before this game. Rodgers must have feared the worst as Simon Mignolet kept his side’s Wembley dreams alive with two stunning saves early in the second period, but then, much to his relief, up popped Coutinho. There is still time, of course, for one of Rodgers’ squad to emerge as the absolute best of this bunch; on May 19, a gala dinner will be held at the city’s Echo Arena when the successor to Suarez will be announced. Daniel Sturridge's injury-hit season has been a tempestuous affair for the out-of-sorts striker. Raheem Sterling was denied of service at Ewood Park during a frustrating display for the contract rebel. At this moment, nobody is better placed than Coutinho. If Liverpool are going to clamber into the top four — still a possibility given Liverpool’s implosion — and win the FA Cup, much will depend on the little Brazilian. He proved he had what it takes to settle a frantic collision at Ewood Park. Rodgers needs him to show that right through until the end of May.

Luis Suarez was Liverpool's player of last season. But who would earn that accolade this year? Jordan Henderson has many backers, as does Coutinho. Several, among them Emre Can and Raheem Sterling, have shone in parts. There have been lots of adequate contributions but there hasn't been anywhere near enough consistency. If Liverpool are going to clamber into the top four and win the FA Cup, much will depend on the little Brazilian.

Article: Norfolk, Virginia (CNN)The second mate of the Houston Express probably couldn't believe what he was seeing. Hundreds of miles from land there was a small boat nearby. At first it looked abandoned. It was in bad shape, listing to one side. The crew of the 1,000-foot long container ship thought it was a yacht that had wrecked. Incredibly, as they got closer, they saw there was a man on it, signaling for help. "He was moving, walking around, waving to us and in surprisingly good condition," Capt. Thomas Grenz told CNN by phone Friday. That man, Louis Jordan, 37, had an amazing story. He'd been drifting on the 35-foot Pearson sailboat for more than two months since leaving Conway, South Carolina, to fish in the ocean. Just a few days into his trip, a storm capsized his boat and broke his mast. One of his shoulders was broken, too, so he couldn't fix the boat right away. Eventually he was able to rig a makeshift mast and sail, but he could make little headway against the currents. "It took so long," Jordan said.  "It moved so slowly." The boat capsized two more times before he was rescued, according to Jordan. His father, Frank Jordan, told CNN's Jim Sciutto that he was expecting his son to look different. "He looked good. Hadn't lost too much weight. He wasn't badly sunburned like I thought he probably would be," he said. Lost at sea for 66 days. After his food and water ran out, it became an issue of survival. Collecting fresh water was a nightmare for Jordan.  The weather wouldn't cooperate. Records show there were more than a dozen storms off the coast of the Carolinas during the time he was missing. The precipitation came at night during harsh conditions. "I had tried to collect (rain)water... but every time the waves would splash into the boat," Jordan said.  "The waves would put saltwater into my freshwater and it tasted bad. "Finally the conditions were right.  I filled up my water tank, which is 25 gallons.  I filled up a bucket." Then there was the issue of food. The fish weren't cooperating, but after a while Jordan learned they were attracted to his laundry, which he would put out to sea for a rinse. The fish would swim in and out of his clothes and he could easily scoop them up with a hand net, he said. Jordan came ashore Thursday evening. CNN affiliate WAVY in Norfolk, Virginia, reported that he was able to walk from the helicopter into Sentara Norfolk General Hospital about 7:30 p.m. Coast Guard officials have said they have found no reason to doubt Jordan's incredible story. They noted that his father contacted them January 29 to report his son and his boat missing. Frank Jordan addressed the skepticism about his son's appearance, saying the boat stayed afloat and upright most of the time. His son spent most of his days in the cabin, out of the sun. Frank Jordan said it was obvious when the Jordans met at the hospital Friday morning that his normally low-key and private son had been through an ordeal. "I know he went through what he went through," Frank Jordan said. Jordan is an unemployed truck driver who lived on his boat at a marina in Conway. He had free rent and free food in the river, he said. But when it became difficult to catch dinner, he took off for the ocean in hopes he would land some bigger fish. Frank Jordan told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Thursday that he had worried about his son, who is an inexperienced sailor, but he held hope because his son had a good boat. And he had the strength to make it. "He's got a very strong constitution and (is strong) not only physically, but spiritually," Frank Jordan said. "And he told me on the phone that he was praying the whole time, so I believe that sustained him a great deal." Rescue swimmer Kyle McCollum was the first to care for Jordan on the flight back to land. "You would expect sunburns, severe sunburn, blisters maybe... a bunch of medical issues that could possibly be wrong with him," he said. "But for him to be in his current state was pretty amazing." Grenz was also surprised by Jordan's condition, physically and mentally. The rescued sailor knew almost exactly what day it was, remarkable for someone who had been on the water for more than 60 days. Jordan was dehydrated and said he was hungry. "We took him to a rescue boat," the container ship captain said. "He was given water and pea soup to gain some power again." Derriel Morris, a neighbor at the Bucksport Plantation Marina & RV Resort called Jordan a nice guy who loved his 47-year-old boat, named "Angel." Morris said: "It was immaculate, it was gorgeous, beautifully painted. I mean it looked like a brand new sailboat." Morris told CNN affiliate WPDE that one day in January he was going to the store and Jordan asked him to bring back some coffee creamer. But when he returned to the marina, Jordan had slipped away. "There was no shore line, no hose; it was like he was never there," Morris told the station. After he disappeared others who also live there held a candlelight ceremony. The marina's manager, Jeff Weeks, told WPDE that Jordan is expected to be back at Buscksport next week. Tales of people who cheated death after days, weeks adrift.

Article: Harry Kane's participation with England at this summer's Under 21 European Championship remains in  doubt after Tottenham confirmed they will travel to Malaysia for a post-season friendly. Spurs announced on Tuesday morning they will visit Kuala Lumpur next month to take on a Malaysia XI in the AIA Cup. The match will take place at the Shah Alam Stadium on Wednesday, May 27 - before Tottenham  take on Sydney FC the following Saturday - and Kane has been told he will be part of the travelling party for the two exhibition games. Harry Kane could miss the Under 21 European Championship due to Tottenham playing a friendly in Malaysia. Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino has expressed fears about burnout for the 21-year-old striker with the FA in talks with Tottenham officials about Kane playing for the Under 21 side in the Czech Republic at this summer's tournament. Kane is keen to play in Gareth Southgate's side at the championship, which runs from June 17-30, but Pochettino wants the forward to miss the tournament in order to have enough recovery time ahead of next season. The young Tottenham forward, who captained his side during Sunday's 0-0 draw with Burnley, has been told he will not be required for the senior friendly against the Republic of Ireland on June 7 or the Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia a week later. Kane scored just 79 seconds into his England debut after coming off the bench to head home during last month's 4-0 win over Lithuania at Wembley. At just 21 years and 251 days, the Tottenham striker led out his side for the first time in draw with Burnley. Kane could not find a way to break the deadlock for Tottenham in the stalemate at Turf Moor on Sunday. Kane scored just 79 seconds into his England debut during the 4-0 win over Lithuania at Wembley last month.

Article: A woman who suffered stomach cramps and bleeding for two years was horrified to be told it was due to a tumour the size of a golf ball in her cervix. Kerry Hamilton was finally diagnosed with leiomyosarcoma, a rare cancer of the soft tissue normally found in women over 50. At just 34, she was forced to undergo a hysterectomy and was devastated at the thought of not being able to have children. She now wants to raise awareness about rare cancers like leiomyosarcoma, so that other women with seemingly 'everyday' symptoms like cramps visit their GP. Kerry Hamilton, 34, had stomach cramps, bleeding and irregular periods for two years. Doctors finally discovered she had a tumour the size of a golf ball growing in her cervix. Ms Hamilton, an education consultant, began experiencing odd symptoms in 2009, when she flew to South Africa to volunteer at a lion research centre for a month (pictured) Since her time in South Africa (pictured) she had experienced spotting in between her periods, longer periods than normal and stomach cramps. Ms Hamilton, from Birmingham, said: 'I'm on a bid to raise awareness about rare cancers and the symptoms that people might ignore - without realising that it is important to listen to their body. 'The kind of cancer I had - despite it being in my cervix - would not have showed up on a smear test. 'So it's important to visit your GP if you're concerned about anything, as well as always going for routine tests.' Ms Hamilton, an education consultant, began experiencing odd symptoms in 2009, when she flew to South Africa to volunteer at a lion research centre for a month. A week before she was due to fly home she fell violently ill with stomach cramps. She spent seven days in hospital where a local doctor told her that she was suffering with a cyst on her ovaries that had burst. Leiomyosarcomas are cancers that develop in a type of muscle tissue called smooth muscle. These muscles are found in the walls of muscular organs like the heart and the stomach. They are rare and usually only affect people over the age of 50, but they can start anywhere in the body. They most commonly start in the walls of the womb, the limbs and the digestive system. People with early leiomyosarcoma often have no symptoms. Possible. symptoms to develop as the cancer advances include a lump or swelling,. abdominal bloating, swelling or pain and a change in menstruation. Source: Macmillan Cancer Support. Over the next two years she returned to the park to work as a guide and a ranger and later returned to the UK where she started working as an educational consultant. When she returned, she went for a routine smear test in 2011 and was given the all clear. Ever since being hospitalised in South Africa she had experienced spotting in between her periods, longer periods than normal and stomach cramps. By last summer these symptoms had become worse and intense pain and lots of bleeding. Her GP suggested it was a hormonal problem and that she go on the contraceptive pill to try and control it. But as she was single, Ms Hamilton didn't see the point of using a contraceptive and felt uneasy about taking hormonal treatment. She also didn't want to ignore the signals her body was giving her, and so never took the contraceptives that were prescribed. It was only in January this year, when she was called for her next smear test, that she was finally diagnosed. The nurse due to carry out the smear said her cervix was so irritated that it was impossible to conduct the test. Ms Hamilton, pictured in 2009, became aware something was seriously wrong when a nurse couldn't perform a smear test on her as there was so much inflammation. Doctors diagnosed Ms Hamilton with a leiomyosarcoma  - a cancer of the soft tissue, the muscle, fat, blood vessels, or any of the other tissues that support, surround and protect the organs of the body. She then broke the devastating news that she suspected Ms Hamilton had cancer. After an MRI scan, doctors confirmed she had leiomyosarcoma and would need a hysterectomy to save her life. A leiomyosarcoma is a cancer of the soft tissue, the muscle, fat, blood vessels, or any of the other tissues that support, surround and protect the organs of the body. Ms Hamilton's was found in the walls of her cervix. Only about 3,300 new cases of soft tissue cancers are diagnosed each year in the UK, and they mainly affect people over the age of 50. Ms Hamilton described the shock of being told she may never be able to become pregnant naturally. 'This was going to be the year I was going to go out and meet someone and start to think about having a family. 'But now I wouldn't be able to carry a child. 'I couldn't believe that I had cancer in my cervix for all that time.' Ms Hamilton underwent a hysterectomy at just 34-and was devastated at the thought of not being able to carry a child. But she remained positive, saying 'there is somebody else going through much worse' She underwent egg collection so that one day she might have a child that is biologically hers. On March 19th this year she underwent the operation to remove her womb – and the tumour – and is now recovering at home. While many women would become disheartened after such an ordeal, Ms Hamilton said she believes. She said: 'Luckily I am a naturally positive person, and I just think that there is somebody else going through something much worse than me. 'When I was finally diagnosed it was more of a relief than anything to know what was wrong. 'It was when I was told that I would need a hysterectomy that when it hit me, and I became really upset.' Even before she had cancer, Ms Hamilton ran the Race for Life for Cancer Research UK, and this year raising money for the charity will be more meaningful than ever. She said: 'I have done the race the last two years, and I always said I would do it every year, so this year I'm on a mission. 'I've already raised £1,600 which is so amazing and humbling.'

Article: Masters Wednesday began on a sombre note when Australian Marc Leishman, who got so close to victory in 2013 before finishing tied fourth behind countryman Adam Scott, had to withdraw. His wife Audrey spent part of last week in an induced coma owing to a serious infection. Leishman left Augusta taking with him the best wishes of his sport. Marc Leishman has withdrawn from this year's competition to be with his wife. Masters chairman Billy Payne talked a lot  about growing the game but he ruled out any idea of starting a women’s Masters. ‘We have a very short member season at Augusta National of seven months,’ he explained. ‘The time that we dedicate to the preparation and conduct of the tournament is already extensive. I don’t think we would ever host another one.’ Billy Payne has ruled out starting a women's Masters despite talking about growing the game. It’s well-known the garish surroundings outside Augusta National contrast markedly with the beauty within. But maybe that’s about to change. After buying up all the houses on adjacent Berckmans Road and turning it into a patrons’ car park, Masters chairman Billy Payne is promising a ‘beautification’ project. ‘As you know, we’re pretty good at landscaping,’ he said. ‘It’s going to look nice, I promise.’ Mr Unpopular Bubba Watson can surely not have upset anyone with his choice of menu for the Champions Dinner on Tuesday. Clearly he enjoyed it so much two years ago he decided to stick with the same inoffensive offering: Caesar salad followed by grilled chicken breast with green beans, mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese and cornbread. Bubba Watson was recently voted the most unpopular golfer on tour by his fellow professionals. Favourite pic of the week so far? It might well be Arnold Palmer, clad in his green jacket, snapped under the Oak Tree in front of the clubhouse alongside Niall Horan, the keen golf-playing member of One Direction but better known in these parts as Rory McIlroy’s par three caddy. Talk about a game that spans the generations. Arnold Palmer shakes hands with Niall Horan ahead of the 79th instalment of the Masters. The famous Eisenhower Tree on the 17th hole might have gone following an ice storm last year but it has certainly not been forgotten. The club unveiled a mounted cross-section of the tree that will remain on show in the press building this week before being presented to the Eisenhower Library in Kansas for permanent display. The tree was named after the American President after he kept hitting it with his drives. A section of the Eisenhower tree is displayed during a news conference at the Masters. Jack Nicklaus showed he’s still got it at the age of 75 with a hole in one at the fourth in the Par-3 contest. But he couldn’t match Colombian Camilo Villegas who recorded two, at the fourth and eighth. Camilo Villegas recorded two aces during the Par-3 contest, beating Jack Nicklaus' solitary hole-in-one.

Article: (CNN)The United States and its negotiating partners reached a very strong framework agreement with Iran in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Thursday that limits Iran's nuclear program in such a way as to effectively block it from building a nuclear weapon. Expect pushback anyway, if the recent past is any harbinger. Just last month, in an attempt to head off such an agreement, House Speaker John Boehner invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to preemptively blast it before Congress, and 47 senators sent a letter to the Iranian leadership warning them away from a deal. The debate that has already begun since the announcement of the new framework will likely result in more heat than light. It will not be helped by the gathering swirl of dubious assumptions and doubtful assertions. Let us address some of these:. The most misleading assertion, despite universal rejection by experts, is that the negotiations' objective at the outset was the total elimination of any nuclear program in Iran. That is the position of Netanyahu and his acolytes in the U.S. Congress. But that is not and never was the objective. If it had been, there would have been no Iranian team at the negotiating table. Rather, the objective has always been to structure an agreement or series of agreements so that Iran could not covertly develop a nuclear arsenal before the United States and its allies could respond. The new framework has exceeded expectations in achieving that goal. It would reduce Iran's low-enriched uranium stockpile, cut by two-thirds its number of installed centrifuges and implement a rigorous inspection regime. Another dubious assumption of opponents is that the Iranian nuclear program is a covert weapons program. Despite sharp accusations by some in the United States and its allies, Iran denies having such a program, and U.S. intelligence contends that Iran has not yet made the decision to build a nuclear weapon. Iran's continued cooperation with International Atomic Energy Agency inspections is further evidence on this point, and we'll know even more about Iran's program in the coming months and years because of the deal. In fact, the inspections provisions that are part of this agreement are designed to protect against any covert action by the Iranians. What's more, the rhetoric of some members of Congress has implied that the negotiations have been between only the United States and Iran (i.e., the 47 senators' letter warning that a deal might be killed by Congress or a future president). This of course is not the case. The talks were between Iran and the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council (United States, United Kingdom, France, China and Russia) plus Germany, dubbed the P5+1. While the United States has played a leading role in the effort, it negotiated the terms alongside its partners. If the agreement reached by the P5+1 is rejected by Congress, it could result in an unraveling of the sanctions on Iran and threaten NATO cohesion in other areas. Another questionable assertion is that this agreement contains a sunset clause, after which Iran will be free to do as it pleases. Again, this is not the case. Some of the restrictions on Iran's nuclear activities, such as uranium enrichment, will be eased or eliminated over time, as long as 15 years. But most importantly, the framework agreement includes Iran's ratification of the Additional Protocol, which allows IAEA inspectors expanded access to nuclear sites both declared and nondeclared. This provision will be permanent. It does not sunset. Thus, going forward, if Iran decides to enrich uranium to weapons-grade levels, monitors will be able to detect such a move in a matter of days and alert the U.N. Security Council. Many in Congress have said that the agreement should be a formal treaty requiring the Senate to "advise and consent." But the issue is not suited for a treaty. Treaties impose equivalent obligations on all signatories. For example, the New START treaty limits Russia and the United States to 1,550 deployed strategic warheads. But any agreement with Iran will not be so balanced.  The restrictions and obligations in the final framework agreement will be imposed almost exclusively on Iran. The P5+1 are obligated only to ease and eventually remove most but not all economic sanctions, which were imposed as leverage to gain this final deal. Finally some insist that any agreement must address Iranian missile programs, human rights violations or support for Hamas or Hezbollah.  As important as these issues are, and they must indeed be addressed, they are unrelated to the most important aim of a nuclear deal: preventing a nuclear Iran.  To include them in the negotiations would be a poison pill. This agreement should be judged on its merits and on how it affects the security of our negotiating partners and allies, including Israel. Those judgments should be fact-based, not based on questionable assertions or dubious assumptions.

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence. The United States and its negotiating partners reached a framework agreement with Iran that limits Iran's nuclear program, but opponents are likely to push back with dubious assumptions and doubtful assertions about the deal's intentions and implications. The agreement reduces Iran's low-enriched uranium stockpile,

Article: Kevin Pietersen is being urged to make the England selectors' lives difficult after his barnstorming start to the summer. England's exiled record run-scorer made 170 off 149 balls against MCC Universities Oxford at The Parks on Sunday, at the start of Surrey's three-day fixture. Former England captains Alec Stewart, Pietersen's boss as Surrey director of cricket, and Nasser Hussain have since both had their say on the 34-year-old's chances of a return to the Test arena. Kevin Pietersen in action for Surrey on day two of the three-day match against Oxford MCCU. Pietersen (centre) pictured with his Surrey team-mates at The Parks on Monday. Stewart is hoping Pietersen can further his quest when Surrey face Glamorgan in their first LV= County Championship fixture next week - while Hussain insists England's selectors need to clarify with a'very public decision' once and for all whether the controversial South Africa-born batsman has any prospects of playing for his adopted country again. Pietersen's impressive return to long-form cricket 14 months after his England sacking was timely, on the eve of the first Test against the West Indies which began 4,000 miles away in Antigua on Monday. Stewart said: 'Anyone who scores runs will ask questions of the selectors. 'Kevin shouldn't look any further than the next innings, whether it's here or down at Cardiff. 'If he strings hundreds together - and the reason we signed him is because we want him to score hundreds, double-hundreds, help us win games and be successful - it will be interesting to see where it may lead to. 'No one has got any idea whether Kevin Pietersen will play for England again. 'The only people that know that are those who are currently picking the England side. 'At the moment he's not being considered, because he hasn't played red ball cricket for the last 14 months.' Pietersen chills out against the fence as Oxford MCCU bat on Monday. Alec Stewart (right) believes that Pietersen could make it difficult for the England selectors. Hussain is impressed that Pietersen has already proved he is serious about a recall, and he is adamant the England and Wales Cricket Board must 'watch out' for him. 'He could easily go off and get his IPL contract and play over there,' Hussain said on Sky Sports 2. 'He's decided to give it another go... people say 'Oh, 170 against Oxford - it was only Oxford'. 'But as a player who has played 100 Test matches to turn up at The Parks and smash 170 shows how determined he is - so I'd watch out, if I was a selector.' Hussain senses Pietersen will not be easily deterred, unless England spell out that they do not want him. 'This is not a lad that's going to go away, and the ECB need to make a decision on Kevin Pietersen - make a very public decision on him, whether he is available for selection or not,' he said. 'I know the chairman elect, Colin Graves, has said that he is. 'But it needs to come from the selectors.' Pietersen believes last week's departure of Paul Downton - the ECB managing director who described him as 'disengaged' - has offered him an England 'lifeline' even as he approaches the veteran stage of his record-breaking career. Stewart, who played for England until the age of 40, added: 'Whether you're 18 or 38, if you're good enough, then I believe you take the age factor out of the occasion. 'If you're performing, surely you've got to be warranting a place in the team.' Pietersen made 170 runs off 149 balls during his stint with the bat in Oxford on Sunday. Pietersen fielding on Monday afternoon as the 34-year-old makes his county cricket return. He hopes Pietersen can boost Surrey's championship promotion prospects, and was encouraged by his comeback. 'It was a very good innings,' Stewart added. 'He had to get used to playing red ball cricket again - lining it up, letting it go - and then he showed what a quality batsman he is, which we all know but we just haven't seen it because he's only played 20-over cricket. 'We've signed Kevin because he's a top-class player. 'Will he play for England? We don't know. All we're going to do is enjoy having Kevin around, scoring as many runs as he can. 'Next game, next innings, is the next most important one.' Pietersen had a quieter second day back in his whites. He fielded at mid-off and slip as Surrey's hosts dug in after resuming on 28 for four. Jack McIver top-scored with 83, hitting 11 fours and a six, in the students' 224 all out. Chris Tremlett, another England Test player, took five for 30. Surrey reshuffled their batting order in the second innings, and Pietersen was left to watch on as they reached 182 for three - Zafar Ansari making 53 towards a lead of 378 entering Tuesday's final day.

Article: Arsenal should target Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech if he leaves Stamford Bridge at the end of the season, insists Carlo Cudicini. Cech has made just five Barclays Premier League appearances this season as Thibaut Courtois remains manager Jose Mourinho's first-choice goalkeeper. But Cudicini feels the 32-year-old Czech Republic international would be a good fit under Arsene Wenger instead of Wojciech Szczesny at Arsenal. Petr Cech, in action for Czech Republic against Latvia last week, is poised to leave Chelsea in the summer. Cech, who joined Chelsea in 2004, has made just five Premier League appearances this season. Chelsea want at least £10million for Cech, and they would have to sell to a direct rival for the goalkeeper to end up at the Emirates. Prompted on TalkSport by Ray Parlour who said Arsenal 'have to get' Cech, Cudicini added: 'I agree. 'Arsenal have had a few problems with goalkeepers after [David] Seaman and [Jens] Lehmann. 'Szczesny is still struggling to impose himself as number one, so if a goalkeeper like Petr Cech is available in the summer, obviously he should be a big target for Arsenal.' Cech revealed last week he does not want to spend another season as understudy to Courtois.

Article: Los Angeles (CNN)It's more than just one state's internal problem. The historic California drought hurts the rest of the union, too. That's because California is a breadbasket to the nation, growing more than a third of its vegetables and nearly two-thirds of its fruits and nuts. Here's why we should heed the ongoing drought in the most populous state, a slowly expanding natural disaster now in its fourth year that this week prompted Gov. Jerry Brown to announce a mandatory 25% cutback in water consumption in all cities. In 2014, one expert predicted consumers would pay more for some groceries because of the California drought. He was often right, according to statistics gathered by Timothy Richards, agribusiness professor at Arizona State University. Prices rose last year for these items on your kitchen table:. • Berries rose in price by about 80 cents per clamshell to $3.88. • Broccoli by 11 cents per pound to $1.89. • Grapes by 64 cents a pound to $3.06. • Melons by 24 cents a pound to $1.23. • Packaged salad by 23 cents a bag to $2.91. • Peppers by 26 cents a pound to $2.39. Though fruits and vegetable prices fell in February, overall prices are expected to rise this year, because of inflation, U.S. Department of Agriculture economist Annemarie Kuhns said. Fresh fruit prices are projected to rise between 2.5% and 3.5%, and vegetables between 2% and 3%, close to historical average increases, Kuhns said. Whether the California drought will affect food prices again this year is unknown, thanks to a strong dollar. The greenback's strength allows producers to import crops that may be withering under the absence of West Coast rain or other misfortunes elsewhere in the nation, Kuhns said. Moreover, the drop in oil prices also eases the cost of transporting food from California to the other 49 states, she said. What economists don't know yet is whether farmers will plant fewer crops because of the drought. Those decisions are now being made in the field and could boost supermarket prices, she said. "The drought in California does have the potential to impact the price we pay for fresh fruit and fresh vegetables and dairy and fresh eggs we pay at the counter," Kuhns said. "We are not sure what the exact impact will be." The reality is there's a major drought throughout the West and Southwest. While not as bad as California, Texas and Oklahoma are also seeing extreme and exceptional drought -- the two worst categories -- in several parts of their states, the U.S. Drought Monitor said this week. Overall, the Western drought affects more than 52 million people, the monitor says. As a result, consumers paid a whopping extra 12.1% for beef and veal in 2014, the USDA reports. Straining under a drought that began in 2012, ranchers in Texas and Oklahoma last year saw smaller grazing pastures, paid more for feed, and experienced difficulties accessing water to cool their cattle. So the cattlemen began culling their herds, Kuhns said. This year's beef and veal prices should rise only by 6% at most, still higher than the 4.1% historical average, the feds project. But beef prices offer an object lesson about the drought. "There's other areas being affected," Kuhns said. It's called the Golden State for the gold rush of yore, but let's face it: the rest of the nation flocks to California for vacation because of another golden reason. Its year-round sunshine. So the next time you take a holiday in California, you'll find a few changes around here, thanks to the drought. Like asking for a glass of water at a restaurant. You won't find water waiting for you on the table. Eateries now "can only serve water to customers on request," the State Water Resources Control Board declared in March under expanded emergency regulations. Tourists can also expect to hear a lot of requests at hotels about whether they want their linens and towels laundered daily. These requests are mandatory under the new regulations. And they'll see fewer homes running decorative fountains. Because much of the snowpack in the Sierra Nevada has alarmingly disappeared, many ski resorts shut down early this year, including at Lake Tahoe, and some are now building zip lines, mountain bike trails and wedding venues to keep tourists coming, the Sacramento Bee reported. "If the drought continues through next winter and we do not conserve more, the consequences could be even more catastrophic than they already are," State Water Board Chair Felicia Marcus said in March. But what about those yummy California wines, you ask? Guess what. They're only getting better -- because of the drought. Yes, you read that right. The 2014 wine grape harvest was "third in a string of great vintages this decade," the Wine Institute says. "California vintners and growers across the state are grateful for another excellent vintage, despite an ongoing drought and earthquake that rocked south Napa in late August just as crush was getting underway," the institute said in a statement last year. "A mild winter and spring caused early bud break, although the overall length of the growing season was similar to past years." Wine grapes use relatively low water, said institute spokeswoman Gladys Horiuchi. "Yes, drought years tend to produce terrific quality," she added. "With the record high California wine grape harvests in 2012, 2013 and 2014, there is a good supply of California wine." That may be the only thing to toast about this drought.

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence. The historic California drought has a significant impact on the rest of the United States, as the state is a major producer of fruits, vegetables, and nuts, and its effects are already being felt in the form of higher prices for certain

Article: Sunday's trip to Loftus Road marks Chelsea’s 700th game under the ownership of Roman Abramovich, a period Jose Mourinho says has been positive not only for the club but for English football as a whole. Some would quibble with the second part of that statement, but Mourinho says that too will change. If the first 699 games under Russian rule has established Chelsea at the top of English and European football, Mourinho believes the next 700 will see them supply more players for the English national team as they implement Abramovich’s demand to follow Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules. Sunday's trip to Loftus Road marks Chelsea’s 700th game under the ownership of Roman Abramovich. Abramovich (right) celebrates with Frank Lampard (centre) and John Terry after Chelsea clinch their first Premier League title under his ownership in 2005. The Russian finally got his hands on the Champions League trophy following Chelsea's success in 2012. Mourinho also believes Chelsea’s adherence to FFP — ‘compared with other clubs and owners who didn’t want to play under the rules’, he pointed out in a thinly veiled dig at Manchester City — positions them as standard bearers for the English game. There can certainly be no doubt Chelsea are in a far stronger position than when Abramovich bought the club from Ken Bates for £140m on June 1, 2003. In the intervening 12 years he has spent in the region of £842.9m on transfer fees, winning three Premier Leagues, four FA Cups, three League Cups, one Europa League and one Champions League, but now, Mourinho says, Abramovich’s rule will benefit England as well as Chelsea. Jose Mourinho, seen here with Abramovich in 2004, has has been in charge of Chelsea for almost five of the Russian's 12 seasons at Stamford Bridge. The Blues have won three Premier Leagues, four FA Cups, three League Cups, one Europa League and one Champions League since 2004. ‘He has been good for Chelsea, good for English football, good for European football,’ said Mourinho, who has been in charge for almost five of those 12 seasons. ‘Chelsea after him became strong, a top club in the country and a top club in Europe. I think that’s very, very good. I think it’s important and I think it’s also important the message Mr Abramovich and this club are passing now. ‘The decision to accept the [Financial Fair Play] rules and play under the rules I think is a big decision compared with other clubs and other owners that didn’t accept the rules and didn’t want to play under the rules. Chelsea are in a far stronger position than when Abramovich bought the club from Ken Bates in 2003. ‘Will the next 700 games under him be good for the English national side? I believe so. In the first team, we had some important players in the national team. 'John Terry, Ashley Cole, Joe Cole, Frank Lampard, Wayne Bridge, Shaun Wright-Phillips. We had a nucleus of four, five players that were always in the national team. ‘Now we are going through a period where it’s just about Gary Cahill. But we have some young boys coming into the first-team. Ruben [Loftus-Cheek] is already here. Normally, in a few years they should be there [in the national side].’ Gary Cahill (above) is now Chelsea's only senior England international in the current first team squad. Mourinho believes the likes of Ruben Loftus-Cheek (left) and Dominic Solanke will represent Chelsea and England for years to come. Mourinho did not name them, but Dominic Solanke, Patrick Bamford, Lewis Baker and Isaiah Brown are thought to be highly-rated at Chelsea, who supply many of the players in England’s age-group teams. The question is whether their young English players will be given the chance in the first team at a club who can take a huge step towards the title by winning at QPR today. It is a game Chelsea go into mindful of decisive slips in last season’s title race but with the title firmly in their own hands now, Mourinho is confident no mistakes will be made. Chelsea are on the verge of a domestic double after picking up the Capital One Cup in March. Mourinho has won seven major trophies while in charge of the west London club. He added: ‘Don’t make me remember the game against Sunderland because that was the game which stopped us fighting for the title. I don’t want to speak again about that game. ‘Last season we were depending on others. We needed this team to lose a couple of points here, a couple of points there. This situation is different. ‘Now we are in a position where we can be isolated of everything. We don’t have to be watching Man City against Man United. We don’t have to be waiting for what they are going to do. It’s just us.’ Fabio Borini celebrates scoring the winning goal during Sunderland's 2-1 win against Chelsea last season. Mourinho believes last season's defeat against Sunderland'stopped' Chelsea from fighting for the title.

Roman Abramovich has been Chelsea owner for 699 games. Chelsea face Premier League clash against QPR on Sunday. Blues have won 14 major trophies since the Russian's arrival in 2003.

Article: England picked up their first title on the Sevens World Series this season after beating competition leaders South Africa 21-14 in the final of the Tokyo tournament on Sunday. Phil Burgess, Charlie Hayter and Tom Mitchell scored the tries in the final for the English, who bounced back from a thumping group stage defeat to Fiji on Saturday to win a first title since the Wellington Sevens in Feb. 2013. 'I am unbelievably proud of this team. It's a huge effort and we are so grateful to deliver this title,' skipper Mitchell said after victory at a wet Prince Chichibu Memorial Rugby Ground. England's  James Rodwell (left) celebrates with his team-mates following their final victory in Tokyo. England defeated championship leaders South Africa 21-14 in the decider of the Sevens Word Series event.

Phil Burgess streaks away to score England's first of three tries in their triumph in Japan. South Africa's Cecil Afrika (centre) kicks on the run as rain stream down during the Tokyo Sevens final. The Fijian's hat-trick bid was ended by the South Africans in a nervy, error-strewn semi-final that the Blitzbokke took 7-5. New Zealand, winners of 12 of the 15 Sevens World Series titles and reigning World Cup sevens champions, endured a disappointing week in the Japanese capital, suffering a first ever loss to Canada in the quarter-finals. The 19-15 defeat sent them into the second tier Plate tournament, which they won after beating France in the last four and then Scotland in the final after Dylan Collier's try in the last play of the game. The 13 points keeping them third on 120. Tom Mitchell needs all of his strength to get to the line as South Africa's Werner Kok tries to pull him up. Mitchell holds off Kok as he just makes the line for England's third try in the important seven-point win. Trans-Tasman rivals Australia dropped to fifth after a weekend to forget in Tokyo. After losing to Portugal and Scotland in group play on Saturday, they then suffered a heartbreaking defeat to the United States in the lung-busting final of the third tier Bowl event. Perry Baker scoring the match ending try in extra time as the ever-improving Americans prevailed 17-12. Portugal won the Shield after edging Argentina 12-7 but last-placed Japan closed the gap on the Iberians to eight points in the battle to avoid relegation after picking up 10 for making a first Cup quarter-final.

Article: A mother who drove six children, including two of her own, to a residence just outside New Orleans so they could fight another group of juveniles, resulting in one child being shot, has been arrested. Police say 35-year-old Lakenya Hall, of Kenner, drove the children to a fight just after 5pm Wednesday after a previous fight at a bus stop.

Article: (CNN)The FBI charged a Philadelphia woman on Thursday with trying to travel overseas to fight for ISIS. She's one of three women arrested this week on terror charges. Two New York women were also taken into custody. An FBI complaint cites numerous social media messages dating back to August 2013 that were sent by Keonna Thomas, 30, also known as "Young Lioness" and "Fatayat Al Khilafah." One Twitter message said, "If we truly knew the realities... we all would be rushing to join our brothers in the front lines pray ALLAH accept us as shuhada [martyrs]." Another said, "When you're a mujahid [violent jihadi fighter] your death becomes a wedding." The FBI said Thomas purchased an electronic visa to Turkey on March 23. Turkey is known as the easiest place from which to enter Syria and join ISIS. An ISIS manual advises recruits to buy round-trip tickets to vacation spots such as Spain and then purchase tickets for their real destination once they arrive overseas, the FBI said. On March 26, Thomas purchased a ticket to Barcelona, with a March 29 departure and an April 15 return to the United States, the complaint said. It's not clear when or where she was arrested. She was charged with knowingly attempting to provide material support and resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization. She could be sentenced to 15 years in prison. On Thursday, Noelle Velentzas, 28, and her former roommate, Asia Siddiqui, 31, were arrested in New York and accused of planning to build an explosive device for attacks in the United States, federal prosecutors said. In the past 18 months, the Justice Department's National Security Division has prosecuted or is prosecuting more than 30 cases of people attempting to travel abroad to join or provide support to terrorist groups. Of those cases, 18 allegedly involve support to ISIS. "The terrorist threat is more decentralized, more diffuse, more complicated," Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told reporters Thursday. "It involves the potential lone wolf actor, it involves the effective use of social media, the Internet."

'Godfather of cricket': Legendary commentator and former Australia captain Richie Benaud has died aged 84. Cricket commentator Richie Benaud has died aged 84 in a Sydney hospice after battling skin cancer. Respected: Benaud died peacefully in his sleep surrounded by his wife Daphne (above) and family members. A veteran of 63 Test matches, Benaud played a key role in the formation of World Series Cricket in the 1970s. A veteran of 63 Test matches, Benaud played a pivotal role in the formation of World Series Cricket in the 1970s and was one of the world's most recognised commentators. In a broadcast career spanning more than five decades, he was instrumental in establishing one-day cricket on television. Such was influence, his dry one-liners and impeccable delivery - including one simple word'marvellous' - were adopted as part of the Australian lexicon. Former Australian spin bowler Shane Warne penned a heartfelt tribute on social media calling him the 'Godfather of cricket'. 'As a cricketer, commentator and as a person, you were the best there's ever been,' he wrote in a note to Benaud. 'For me it was an honour and a privilege to call you a close friend and mentor. 'We had so many wonderful times together, talking cricket and in particular, our love and passion of leg spin bowling. Former  captain Richie Benaud stands by a sculpture of himself at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 2008. Floral tributes have started to gather at the bronze statue of Richie Benaud at the Sydney Cricket Ground. The flags at the Sydney Cricket Ground were flying at half mast on Friday following Benaud's death. As a player, Benaud was a trailblazing all-rounder who took 248 wickets and scored 2,201 runs in 63 Tests while never losing a series in charge of his country. He enjoyed a remarkable Test career as a wily leg-spin bowler and middle-order batsman which ended with his retirement in 1964. Benaud scored three Test centuries and once hit 11 sixes in a first class innings. After retiring, Benaud became a commentary icon initially with the BBC in England and later in his native Australia. In a broadcast career spanning more than five decades, he was instrumental in establishing one-day cricket on television. Such was influence, his dry one-liners and impeccable delivery - including one simple word'marvellous' - were adopted as part of the Australian lexicon. He was the mainstay in Australian cricket television commentary until the past two summers - a car accident in 2013 sidelined him before he announced in November last year he had skin cancer. At the time of his death, Benaud had witnessed - as both player and commentator - well over 500 Test matches. Benaud was born in Penrith in western Sydney in October 1930. Warne also thanked Benaud for the support he gave to him as a young cricketer. 'Richie, you were loved by everyone, not just the cricket family, you were the godfather of cricket and you will be missed by all.' Australian Test captain Michael Clarke said Benaud was a gentleman who played cricket in the right spirit. 'He was a great player and a great captain; a wonderful leader of men and he continued that off the field,' Clarke told the Nine Network. 'Our country has lost a national treasure,' Cricket Australia chairman Wally Edwards said in a statement on Friday. 'After Don Bradman, there has been no Australian player more famous or more influential than Richie Benaud.' 'He loved winning. He helped the Australian team have the attitude where they wanted to win. He played the game the right way. 'There's no doubt he's certainly going to be missed.' Prime Minister David Cameron said: 'I grew up listening to Richie Benaud's wonderful cricket commentary. Like all fans of the sport, I will miss him very much.' Former Australian fast bowler Brett Lee said: 'When Richie walks into the Channel Nine box everyone stands up. 'When Richie was on, you'd see all the commentators listening in to see what Richie had to say. 'A lot of children growing up know him as a commentator but he's a great cricketer in his own right.' Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has offered Richie Benaud's family a state funeral following his death. Benaud was one of the world's most recognised commentators having initially started with the BBC in England before anchoring the Nine Network's cricket coverage in Australia for decades. A veteran of 63 Test matches, Benaud played a pivotal role in the formation of World Series Cricket in the 1970s and was one of the world's most recognised commentators. Benaud was the face and voice of cricket, much admired, much imitated, and in his later years  a cult figure. Former Prime Minister John Howard greeted Richie Benaud at the Sydney Cricket Ground back in 2001. Benaud and ex-Hampshire cricket captain and TV presenter Richie Benaud pictured here at Sophia Gardens in Cardiff during the first England v Australia Test match in 2009. 'There would hardly be an Australian over the last 40 years who hasn't listened to Richie Benaud,' he told ABC radio on Friday. 'He certainly will be very, very much missed.' Benaud had anchored the Nine Network's cricket coverage in Australia for decades. 'Richie Benaud's passing has robbed us not only of a national treasure but a lovely man,' Nine Network CEO David Gyngell said in a statement. 'Richie earned the profound and lasting respect of everyone across the world of cricket and beyond. First as an outstanding player and captain, then as an incomparable commentator and through it all, as a wonderful human being.' The cricket commentator had been receiving radiation treatment for skin cancer since November when he was admitted to a Sydney hospice on Thursday. Richie Benaud married his wife Daphne in July 1967. At the time of his death in Sydney overnight Benaud had witnessed - as both player and commentator - well over 500 Test matches. Benaud was born in Penrith in western Sydney in October 1930. He enjoyed a remarkable Test career as a wily leg-spin bowler and middle-order batsman which ended with his retirement in 1964. Benaud was the first player to score 2,000 Test runs and take 200 Test wickets yet was as much renowned for his captaincy - he never lost a Test series as Australian captain. After retiring, Benaud became a commentary icon initially with the BBC in England and later in his native Australia. He was the mainstay in Australian cricket television commentary until the past two summers - a car accident in 2013 sidelined him before he announced in November last year he had skin cancer. As a player, Benaud appeared in 63 Test matches between 1951 and 1963, becoming the first man from any nation to score 2000 Test runs and take 200 Test wickets.

Penrith-born Benaud enjoyed a remarkable Test career as a wily leg-spin bowler and middle-order batsman which ended with his retirement in 1964. 'When I was a kid we never ever wore a cap... because Keith Miller never wore a cap,'Benaud said at the time. 'If I knew, when I was at school and playing in my early cricket days, the problems that would have come if I didn't do something about protection of the head and using sunscreens and all sorts of things like that, I'd have played it differently. 'It's one of those things in life: you live and learn as you go along.' Benaud did, however, manage to voice a touching tribute to Phillip Hughes, who died when struck by a bouncer last November, which was screened before Australia's Test series against India last December. Hundreds of admirers dressed up as the legendary commentator during the Sydney Ashes Test of 2014 when Benaud lay in hospital with complications from a serious car accident some months earlier. Benaud was the mainstay in Australian cricket television commentary with crowd members even dressing up as him as he became something of a cult figure in his later years. As a player, Benaud appeared in 63 Test matches between 1951 and 1963, becoming the first man from any nation to score 2000 Test runs and take 200 Test wickets. His Australian record Test tally of 248 wickets has since been overtaken by many, most notably fellow legspinner Shane Warne, whose career tally of 708 was unimaginable in Benaud's day. Benaud scored three Test centuries and once hit 11 sixes in a first class innings. Shane Warne penned a heartfelt tribute to Richie Benaud on social media on Friday. As captain he led Australia to four consecutive series victories, beginning with a 4-0 demolition of Peter May's 1958-59 tourists (Benaud took 31 wickets in the five tests). He never lost a series as captain. The Nine Network will air a special on the life of cricketing great Richie Benaud on Saturday night at 7pm.

Article: The Manchester derby is now one of the biggest match-ups in world football. Millions across the globe cram around TV screens to catch a glimpse of the fixture, and its appeal gets ever greater with each passing season. But just how Manchester is the clash between City and United? Sportsmail takes a look at everything local between the two giants. Sergio Aguero and Manchester City travel to Old Trafford to face United on Sunday afternoon. Owners. You will not find many United fans who pine for the days when Martin Edwards, son of a Salford butcher, ruled the roost at Old Trafford. Despite being the man who brought Sir Alex Ferguson to the club and backed him when many wanted him sacked, former chairman Edwards (who was later cautioned after a peeping tom episode in a ladies toilet) remained a figure of distrust. Likewise, there will not be many City supporters who look back fondly on the chaotic era of hometown former TV salesman and combover king Peter Swales, who often came across as out of tune with reality (if you get a chance watch the hilariously belief-defying City! documentary on YouTube), as he went through manager after manager after manager. Peter Swailes was local, but not many Manchester City fans want to be reminded of his chairmanship. Not many United fans pine for the days when Martin Edwards, son of a Salford butcher, ruled the roost. Sheikh Mansour might not be local but is a hugely popular figure at Manchester City after bankrolling the club. Avram (left) and Joel Glazer have proved divisive figures at United since their family bought the club. At Old Trafford, there remains a resentment for those upstairs. That the owners are from Tampa and not Timperley, however, is irrelevant. The Glazer family could be from Timbuktu - their cash-draining tenure is still hard to take even though the yellow and green scarves are not as easy to spot. Across town, however, the sheikh who shook it up for the Blues is a hero. Is there a more popular owner in football? While City fans may no longer (thankfully) pay homage by wearing Arabic robes or waving £20 notes in the air, the man from Abu Dhabi is adored. Managers. It has always been rare to find a football club with a hometown manager. However, you do get the sense that both Louis van Gaal and Manuel Pellegrini do their best to familairise themselves with their environment. Van Gaal has taken a lot of local knowledge from Ryan Giggs. More than once the Dutchman has asked the son of Salford (via Cardiff) to speak to the players about the opposition and tell them exactly what victory would mean to the supporters. Giggs, a fierce Red, is said to have come into his own when Liverpool were next up. Louis van Gaal has tried to immerse himself in the local culture after taking over as manager last summer. Van Gaal has leaned on assistant boss Ryan Giggs for tips around the city during his stint in charge. Manuel Pellegrini has been keen to familiarise himself with Manchester over the last two years. Manager Pellegrini with chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak (left) over in Abu Dhabi last May. Van Gaal, who originally stationed himself at a city centre hotel, frequented many of the city's finest eating establishments and knows his way around town. While you won't see Pellegrini supping a pint of mild next to the bronze statue of LS Lowry in city centre backstreet boozer Sam's Chop House, the Chilean has also been quick to immerse himself in local culture. Not too long after his arrival he was spotted in a Hale picture shop, having maps of the local area framed for his walls. However, when this reporter once asked him if he had been anywhere nice during his time off the answer of 'York' was not what was expected. Coaches. The aforementioned Giggs, as assistant manager, gives the coaching staff at Old Trafford a homegrown element. Brian Kidd (right, at Crystal Palace on Monday) is Manchester through and through. Kidd is more Mancunian than Happy Mondays dancer Bez drinking a can of Boddingtons in the rain. Unless Tyler Blackett makes a comeback for United there won't be any local lads in the two XIs. Aside from the local lad, the only things missing from Carrington are a windmill and some tulips with Dutch quintet Frans Hoek, Albert Stuivenberg, Marcel Bout, Jos van Dijk and Max Reckers key players. It is a similar situation at City with Brian Kidd, more Mancunian than Bez drinking a can of Boddingtons in the rain, co-assistant manager alongside a number of the boss's trusted lieutenants. Fiery Argentinian Ruben Cousillas splits responsibilities with Kidd while goalkeeping coach Xabier Mancisidor and Jose Cabello, both Spaniards, complete the Latin look. Players. Both clubs pride themselves on bringing through their own products. However, when Sir Alex arrived at Old Trafford he was disgusted to learn that City scooped the cream of Manchester's talent and quickly (and successfully) set about putting that right. A generation such as the Class of '92 is unlikely to be seen again, but the derby could see no Mancunians in either squad for the second time in a row. For three years, after the departure of Wes Brown to Sunderland, Danny Welbeck flew the Manchester flag. But following the Longsight lad's move to Arsenal, November's first instalment at the Etihad Stadium saw not one hometown native in either squad for the first time in living memory. Sir Alex Ferguson was disgusted that City's youth academy was more profitable on arrival at United. Along with Ferguson, Eric Harrison (left) brought through the Class of 92, to include Ryan Giggs, Nicky Butt, David Beckham, Gary Neville, Phil Neville, Paul Scholes and Terry Cooke. Wayne Rooney was only born 30 miles down the road but he may as well be from another planet as far as many from this neck of the woods are concerned. There will be Italians, Argentines, Spaniards, Ivorians and maybe even a Colombian, but unless Tyler Blackett can stun the football world and force his way into Van Gaal's line-up, it will be a Manc-free derby. Fans. Interest in the derby will be spread all over the world. United like to remind us of their 659m global followers while City, according to a recent club-commissioned report, have a fanbase that is rapidly expanding across the planet. Outside Old Trafford, street vendors will attempt to flog half-and-half scarves. Some of the tourists may even buy them. Manchester City fans are derided by their rivals for the amount of 'empty seats' at the Etihad Stadium. Regardless, nowhere will victory be celebrated with as much vigour and defeat taken with as much bitterness as in Manchester. No United fans from Manchester? City fans all from Stockport? Nonsense. Ask any Red or Blue if they fancy going into work on Monday after a derby loss and they will give you the same answer. While City fans may serenade their hosts with 'You're the pride of Singapore' and United supporters respond in kind with jibes about empty seats at 'the council house' both know that this is a city divided by football loyalties.

Article: (CNN)Since Iran's Islamic Revolution in 1979, women have been barred from attending most sports events involving men. But the situation appears set to improve in the coming months after a top Iranian sports official said that the ban will be lifted for some events. A plan to allow "women and families" to enter sports stadiums will come into effect in the next year, Deputy Sports Minister Abdolhamid Ahmadi said Saturday, according to state-run media. But it isn't clear exactly which games women will be able to attend. According to the state-run Press TV, Ahmadi said the restrictions would be lifted for indoor sports events. The rules won't change for all matches because some sports are mainly related to men and "families are not interested in attending" them, Press TV cited him as saying. Iranian authorities imposed the ban on women attending men's sports events after the revolution, deeming that mixed crowds watching games together was un-Islamic. During the ensuing decades, the crowds at soccer games, Iran's most popular sport, have been all male. Iranian women were briefly permitted to attend volleyball matches under the moderate President Mohammad Khatami, but the ban was reinstated in 2005 after the more hard-line Mahmoud Ahmadinejad came to power. The Iranian government has come under pressure from international sports officials over the restrictions. FIFA President Sepp Blatter called on Iran last month to end its "intolerable" ban on women attending soccer matches, saying the situation "cannot continue." Iran had been in the running to host the 2019 edition of soccer's Asian Cup, but the tournament was awarded to the United Arab Emirates. The ban on women attending matches was widely seen as a major impediment to Iran's chances of securing the event. The ban came under the spotlight at the Asian Cup in Australia earlier this year, when thousands of female Iranian fans watched their soccer team without restriction. During the match against Iraq, activists called for the ban to end and unfurled a banner showing the face of Ghoncheh Ghavami, a British-Iranian woman detained in Iran last year while trying to watch a volleyball match. Iranian officials have denied that Ghavami was arrested for attending the volleyball game, saying she was taken into custody for "anti-Iran activities." The news agency Reuters reported that she was recently pardoned by the Court of Appeal. CNN's Annie Ramos contributed to this report.

Article: Lewis Hamilton's love of the Shanghai International Circuit continues to show no bounds as the reigning Formula One champion again claimed pole position for the race. Hamilton now has a record five poles to his name at the track, and three in succession, to take his tally to 41 overall in his career. The 30-year-old Briton ultimately finished just 0.042secs ahead of his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg to give the team another front-row lock out. Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel, a surprise winner last time out in Malaysia, will start third, albeit down by nine tenths of a second on Hamilton. Now click here to read the full qualifying report. Host commentator. Thank you for joining us this morning and be sure to return tomorrow for our coverage of Sunday’s race. 1 Hamilton; 2 Rosberg; 3 Vettel; 4 Massa; 5 Bottas; 6 Raikkonen; 7 Ricciardo; 8 Grosjean; 9 Nasr; 10 Ericsson. ‘Oh come on, guys’, Rosberg exasperates after missing out on pole by 0.042secs. Hamilton fails to improve on his time, but it doesn’t matter as Rosberg can’t beat his lap. It is Hamilton’s pole. Back on track and all 10 drivers are out for their final runs and they’re all on fresh tyres. Here we go…. Meanwhile... Vettel crosses the line to go fourth fastest as he splits the Williams pair of Massa and Bottas. We’ve got four minutes to run. The Mercedes pair are so much quicker than the rest of the field here. Raikkonen is the first of the Ferrari drivers to post a time and he is the best part of two seconds slower than Hamilton on a used set of option tyres. And Hamilton crosses the line with a 1:35.782. Wow. What can Rosberg do? The Mercedes man is 0.280secs slower than his team-mate. Bottas is the first driver to post a competitive lap, and he crosses the start-finish line with a 1:37.903… but it is Hamilton up next. We’ll see two runs from each driver and Hamilton is the first of the Mercedes pair to take to the track. So, we’re already underway with the final session to determine the top 10… surely, Lewis Hamilton won’t be stopped in his quest for a third straight pole this year? So, surprisingly both Toro Rossos fail to make the top-10 shootout with Verstappen and Sainz to start 13th and 14th tomorrow. Hamilton remains the quickest man on the track. So, we’re in the last minute of Q2 and Massa, Ericsson, Nasr and Perez are facing the drop. Vettel crosses the line to go faster than Raikkonen,  but he is half-a-second off Hamilton’s mighty lap. Raikkonen goes third-fastest with a 1:37.1, but the Finn is seven tenths slower than Hamilton… what can Vettel do in the sister Ferrari? Neither Ferrari driver are yet to post a time, so the best of the rest behind the Mercedes pair is currently the Lotus of Romain Grosjean, 1.6 seconds slower than Hamilton. That really is a stunning time from the world champion. Rosberg follows Hamilton across the line, but he is three tenths slower than his Mercedes team-mate. The Briton really appears to be a class above his Mercedes team-mate this weekend. Valtteri Bottas leads the way until Hamilton posts a 1:36.423 with his first run of the afternoon on the soft-option tyre. He then reports that his seat was getting really warm on that lap; a problem he mentioned during practice this morning. The second session is underway in Shanghai to determine which drivers will make it through to the top-10 shootout. That’s quite a big shock to see McLaren on the penultimate row again. Button, Alonso and the team have been speaking with plenty of optimism this weekend, but they will start tomorrow’s race only 17th and 18th. So, the McLaren drivers do not make it out of Q1 and Button and Alonso will start on the penultimate row for tomorrow's Chinese Grand Prix. But as I write that, Vettel goes fastest with a 1:37.502. Carlos Sainz, Pastor Maldonado, Romain Grosjean, Will Stevens and Roberto Merhi occupy the drop zone with a minute to go…. Raikkonen is back on track, on the softs, and it is the Finn’s turn to top the timesheets as he goes some two tenths faster than Bottas. Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa are both on the option tyres for their first timed runs of the afternoon. Bottas goes fastest with a 1:38.014 as Massa slots into third. Button, also on the soft compound, is faster than Alonso by four tenths, and he slots his McLaren into P7. The Briton comes over the radio to complain that the ‘rears are overheating’. Alonso is already donning the soft compound tyre. He comes across plenty of traffic on his fast lap, but still manages to go eighth… for now. So, with 10 minutes to go, Hamilton leads the way from Rosberg, Hulkenberg, Felipe Nasr, Vettel, Raikkonen and the ever-impressive Max Verstappen. Rosberg is the next driver to cross the line and he posts a lap of 1:38.496 which is some two tenths off his team-mate. Nico Hulkenberg, on the much faster softer compound tyre, pops his Force India into third. Here comes Hamilton, who looks at ease in his Mercedes, and the British driver is 1.6 seconds faster than Vettel. Ouch. Raikkonen crosses the line to post a 1:40.917, but he appeared to be struggling with plenty of understeer on that lap and Vettel crosses the line to go one second quicker than his Ferrari team-mate. Plenty of smoke as Lewis Hamilton’s Mercedes is fired up, but there’s no problem with the world champion’s Silver Arrows as he takes to the circuit for Q1. Kimi Raikkonen meanwhile is the first big gun out on a hot lap…. Fernando Alonso failed to post a time in this morning's practice session, but the Spaniard is first out of the blocks as today's qualifying session gets underway. Security has been ramped up for this week’s race in China after a spectator managed to get on to the track during yesterday’s second practice session. The local man darted across the start-finish line before leaping over the pit wall and walking into the Ferrari garage. He is then alleged to have said: ‘I want a car. I’ve got a ticket.’ Rosberg has been challenged by Mercedes F1 chairman Niki Lauda to raise his game this weekend after being outclassed by Hamilton in both races so far this term. Here, the German is taking part in his traditional warm-up before hopping into his Mercedes for this afternoon’s qualifying session. That said, Mercedes, and Lewis Hamilton in particular, appear to be back to their ominous best in Shanghai. Hamilton has been fastest in all three practice sessions this weekend at a track where he has already won on three occasions and was the pole-sitter here in 2013 and again last year. The 30-year-old posted a time of one minute 37.615secs, finishing 0.226secs quicker than team-mate Rosberg. Fresh from his win in Sepang, Vettel was the best of the rest, albeit some seven tenths down on Hamilton’s best lap. Good morning and welcome to our coverage of today’s qualifying session for the Chinese Grand Prix. After Lewis Hamilton led Nico Rosberg home in a Mercedes one-two at the curtain raiser in Melbourne, we were told a year of domination from the Silver Arrows loomed. But how wrong they  were. Sebastian Vettel, in his Ferrari, upset the odds to roar to victory in Malaysia to blow the race for the championship back open and give Mercedes food-for-thought ahead of this week’s Chinese Grand Prix and for the remainder of the campaign.

Article: Franck Ribery says his relationship with Louis van Gaal was 'poisoned' at Bayern Munich and claims the current Manchester United coach is a 'bad man' who loses players' trust. Van Gaal took charge of the Bavarians in 2009 but only lasted two years, with Ribery admitting he considered a move while the Dutchman was at the club. The French winger says that while Van Gaal, who claimed a league and cup double in his first season, can do great things on the pitch, he did not take to him off it.

Ribery claims Van Gaal lost the players' trust while he considered a move away from the Bundesliga club. 'We had problems on a human basis,' Ribery told Goal. 'When he started, nobody knew what was going to happen. 'His idea was that he did not care about names at all, you don't need stars, everybody had to prove themselves again. 'The first contact with him was already poisoned. As a professional you lose your trust. He does great things on the pitch but the coach Van Gaal was a bad man. Our relationship was crushed.' Ribery also claimed that Real Madrid tried to sign him in 2009, only to be persuaded to stay in Germany after being told he was as important to Bayern as Lionel Messi was to Barcelona. As well as the La Liga giants, he admitted Chelsea and Manchester City as well a host of top European clubs were interested in acquiring his services. He added: 'It was a burden. Many clubs tried to persuade me to change: Real Madrid, Barcelona, Juventus, Chelsea, Manchester City. You start to think. I made up my mind about where my future should lie. I think that this is human.' Ribery celebrates after scoring against Shakhtar Donetsk in this year's Champions League. Van Gaal is currently the Manchester United manager with his side sitting in third place in the Premier League.

Article: Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has said he hopes Burnley escape relegation after seeing his side have to fight to gain a narrow 1-0 victory at Turf Moor. Wenger has been praised by Burnley boss Sean Dyche this season and last night the Gunners boss repaid the compliment by saying: 'It would be a shame for Burnley to go down.' Arsenal were made to fight hard for their eighth win in a row and Wenger said: 'I understand now why they took points from other teams like Chelsea and Manchester City. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has said he hopes Burnley escape relegation from the Premier League. Burnley manager Sean Dyche shakes hands with Wenger following Arsenal 1-0 victory at Turf Moor. 'When you see their performance tonight (Saturday), I am surprised by their plight near the bottom. They have a great solidarity and organisation in their side. Burnley have won only once in 11 games, a famous 1-0 victory against City, but Dyche still believes they can escape the drop. They are currently two points from safety but face three fellow strugglers Hull City, Leicester City and Aston Villa in their final six fixtures. They have played seven teams at the top of the table in their last eight games. Aaron Ramsey (right) scored the only goal of the game, but it was enough to secure three points. The Welsh midfielder points to the sky as he celebrates putting Arsenal into a early 1-0 lead. 'We have six big games coming and we have shown this season we can score goals,' he said. 'We are not naïve. We are willing and have an appetite to succeed.' 'The outside world thought we might not take anything from our last seven games. There are teams around us who are having an awkward time and maybe they feel the next matches more than us. 'It could well go do the wire. I am only concerned about us. I know if our performances are right, we will win games. I think we have measured ourselves well against the top sides and now there are going to be different type of games, edgy games.' Burnley were unlucky not to draw level after this acrobatic attempt was saved by David Ospina.

Article: (CNN)Just as mimeograph machines and photocopiers were in their day, online activity -- blogs, YouTube channels, even social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter -- have fully emerged as the alternative to traditional mainstream media. It is not just the low cost of posting online that attracts dissidence, though that in itself is liberating. It is the lack of access to traditional print and broadcast media in authoritarian countries that is really the driving force leading disaffected voices to post online. It is not unique to Asia, but it might seem more pronounced if you live there. Going online has become the path of least resistance if you want to make yourself heard. But it still brings resistance, some of it legal, some of it deadly. Let's look at the legal angle first. Amos Yee, the teenage video blogger who was arrested and held pending bail Sunday in Singapore, drew international attention for his anti-Lee Kuan Yew harangue. But jailing critics is not usually the government's first choice in Singapore. It is part of Lee Kuan Yew's legacy that the government's use of the courts to bring libel and defamation cases, usually carrying heavy financial penalties, is the preferred method of silencing discomfiting online voices. His father has reportedly apologized for his son's behavior, but the younger Yee could face up to three years in jail. Yee is not unique. Another dissident blogger in Singapore, Roy Ngerng, continues to suffer financial and legal pressure, including the loss of his job, because of a blog post that allegedly accused the city-state's Prime Minister, Lee Hsien Loong, of corruption. Ngerng's concern is with the lack of transparency in the management of the Central Provident Fund, the government's compulsory pension program. Yee and Ngerng are two of many. The Committee To Protect Journalists' file on Singapore going back to 2000 has a long string of similar cases, some against politicians, others against citizens simply frustrated with their government. But it is not just Singapore where Internet activity comes under fire: On Monday in Malaysia, with much less of the international attention heaped on Amos Yee, five editors and executives from The Malaysian Insider were arrested over the site's March 25 report claiming that a senior council of royal rulers and state governors, known as the Conference of Rulers, had rejected a proposal to amend federal law to allow for the introduction of hudud, or punishments meted out under Islamic law. In deeply Muslim Malaysia, questions of Islamic faith are a third-rail issue, as is revealing government decisions before they are announced. By far the biggest jailer of journalists in the world is China, where a majority of the 44 people behind bars at the end of 2014 were bloggers, most of them Uighur or Tibetan activists who straddle the line between journalism and activism. But in second place in Asia is Vietnam, where CPJ's most recent prison census showed Vietnam holding 16 reporters behind bars as of December 1. Add one more in late December, Nguyen Dinh Ngoc, a prominent blogger who was arrested for "law-violating" after police searched his home in southern Ho Chi Minh City on December 27, and two more in January, Nguyen Quang Lap and Hong Le Tho, arrested on anti-state charges of "abusing democratic freedoms" and you can see the pattern. Because the print and broadcast media are so totally government controlled, mainstream journalists seldom go to jail any more in Vietnam. Only two investigative print reporters remain behind bars in Vietnam, their cases dating back to 2012 and 2013. Both were accused of accepting bribes for dialing back critical news coverage. The list could go on, but the reality is that, as CPJ wrote in 2013, across Asia "governments have curtailed Internet freedoms through increasingly restrictive practices, including prohibitive laws, heightened surveillance and censorship, and threats of imprisonment on various national security-related offenses." That is still the policy path being followed by most countries in Asia, and it does not look like it will be changing any time soon. Jailing journalists is one thing, but watching them being killed and doing little or nothing about it is another. Since 1992, 11% of journalists killed have died for their work online. Because our 1992 start date really precedes the full advent of the Internet, that proportion can be expected to grow. While most bloggers have not been the targets of murderers, Bangladesh has recently become the exception. On Monday, Washiqur Rahman Babu was the second blogger to be hacked to death in public in Bangladesh in the past five weeks. Blogger Avijit Roy and his wife, Rafida Ahmed Bonna, were attacked by assailants wielding sharp weapons while the couple was visiting Dhaka. Roy, a U.S. citizen of Bangladeshi origin, was killed and his wife was critically injured. Both Rahman and Roy had written critically on Islamic matters. The blogger death toll gets higher in Bangladesh if you go back a year or two, and religious beliefs are always involved, and the killings almost always carried out with near perfect impunity. In January 2013, blogger Asif Mohiuddin, who wrote critical commentary on religion, Islamist groups, free speech, and human rights, barely survived after he was stabbed by Islamists. In February 2013, blogger Ahmed Rajib Haider, who had written about Islamic fundamentalism and Islamist groups, was hacked to death by members of an Islamist militant group, according to police investigations. Later in 2013, Islamist groups called for the execution of bloggers they said had committed blasphemy. While arrests were made after those murders, there have been no convictions. The bottom line: Online journalists, operating outside the restraints of mainstream media, have become the most vulnerable targets for governments and independent actors. Where there is the restrictive rule of law, journalists are vulnerable to the anger of officialdom. Where the rule of law is weak, they are vulnerable to the attacks of killers who seldom, if ever, answer to the rule of law.

Article: Zarina Diyas and Heather Watson were the seeded casualties on the first day of main-draw action at the Family Circle Cup in Charleston. Diyas, the 11th seed from Kazakhstan, won the first set against Czech qualifier Lucie Hradecka but was beaten 4-6 6-1 6-3. British number one Watson, seeded 16th, gave up 14 break points and lost her serve seven times en route to a 6-3 4-6 7-5 defeat to Croatian teen Donna Vekic in a hard-fought match lasting more than two and a half hours. Heather Watson crashed out in Charleston after a narrow victory to Donna Vekic. The other seeds in action, Irina-Camelia Begu and Mona Barthel, progressed in straight sets. Begu, seeded 13th, required two hours and a second-set tie-break to win 6-2 7-6 (7/5) against German qualifier Laura Siegemund, who had hammered Japanese veteran Kimiko Date-Krumm 6-0 6-1 to reach the tournament proper. Barthel, two places lower than Begu in the seedings, broke serve four times in a 6-3 6-3 win over Hungary's Timea Babos. Chanelle Scheepers of South Africa won 6-2 2-6 6-4 against New Zealand's Marina Erakovic while Croatian Ajla Tomljanovic beat Romania's Alexandra Dulgheru 7-6 (7/5) 4-6 6-4. There was an easier time for Diyas' Kazakh compatriot Yaroslava Shvedova, who beat Switzerland's Stefanie Voegele 7-5 6-2. The two all-American ties ended with Lauren Davis beating Grace Min and wild-card Sachia Vickery victorious against qualifier Jessica Pegula, both in three sets. Shelby Rogers brushed aside Spain's Silvia Soler-Espinosa 6-3 6-1 but Irina Falconi was dismissed just as comfortably by Tatjana Maria of Germany and Nicole Gibbs and Christina McHale lost in straight sets to Shuai Zhang and Danka Kovinic respectively. Kristina Kucova beat Mirjana Lucic-Baroni while Evgeniya Rodina saw off Yulia Putintseva. The last match of the evening went the distance with Ukrainian qualifier Kateryna Bondarenko eventually beating Alison Riske of America 6-4 4-6 6-1 after two hours on court.

Article: Jack Nicklaus recorded his first ever hole-in-one at the Masters on Wednesday, as Camilo Villegas fired two in the space of five holes but still could not win the traditional par-three contest. Villegas holed out on the fourth and eighth as he finished alongside Kevin Streelman on five under par, only to find water on the eighth when he played it again as the third play-off hole. Kevin Streelman holds his trophy aloft after winning the Par-3 Contest on a play-off against Camilo Villegas. Streelman therefore became the latest player to be saddled with the 'curse' of the par-three champion, with no player ever becoming par-three and Masters champion in the same year. However, that was placed firmly into perspective thanks to his 11-year-old caddie Ethan Couch, who has a benign but inoperable brain tumour. Streelman found Couch via the Make-a-Wish Foundation and invited him to be his caddie in the light-hearted curtain-raiser. Augusta National's par-three course traditionally hosts the contest the day before start of the major. 'It was a really fun day, especially to have Ethan with me here,' Streelman said. 'This isn't about me today. It's about helping him out and showing him a great day.' Villegas said: 'I've made a few hole-in-ones, but it's pretty special to make them here. The second one, we were a little more emotional there. We just kind of jumped.' Nicklaus had earlier holed out with an eight iron from 123 yards on the fourth, his ball landing around 15 feet past the pin and spinning back into the hole. Woods played in the Masters par-three contest at Augusta National for the first time in 11 years. That took the 75-year-old six-time champion to three under par, but he would bogey the fifth and hit two balls into the water on the ninth to end his hopes of an unlikely triumph. Former US Open champion Curtis Strange reminded Nicklaus of the tradition that players who make a hole-in-one have to buy the drinks in the clubhouse when Nicklaus walked past the ESPN commentary position. 'Send me a bill,' Nicklaus replied. The Masters official Twitter account shared an image of Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods with Niall Horan. The 18-time major winner added on ESPN: 'I never had a hole in one at Augusta, in the par three (contest) or on the golf course. Doing an interview this morning I said all I have to do is go out there, make a hole-in-one and win the par three. I had it three under and then choked.' Since the contest started in 1960, nobody has ever become par-three and Masters champion in the same week, a fact which sometimes sees players deliberately not shoot the best score possible. Most treat it as light relief and invite family or friends to act as their caddies, including Tiger Woods this year for the first time since 2004. Woods had his children Charlie and Sam on his bag and made sure he could not win the event by getting daughter Sam to tap in for par on the sixth. Jack Nicklaus (centre) with Ben Crenshaw (left) and Gary Player (right) during the Par-3 Contest. 'We had an absolutely great time. These were memories for a lifetime,' said Woods, who was also accompanied by girlfriend Lindsey Vonn. He later added on Twitter: 'I'll always have memories of my pop at Augusta and now Sam & Charlie. An amazing day.' Tournament favourite Rory McIlroy had One Direction singer Niall Horan acting as his caddie and Horan proved he should stick to singing after badly hooking a tee shot on the ninth into the water. 'I apologise to golf,' Horan joked. 'I do perform to a lot of people but we were performing to their parents today! There was a lot of pressure.' McIlroy, who is looking to become the sixth player to complete the career grand slam by winning a first Masters title on Sunday, added: 'I wanted to do this because it's a big week for me and just to go into the tournament in a relaxed mood.

Article: (CNN)When singer Avril Lavigne went missing from the music scene, there was tons of speculation. Was she pregnant? In rehab? Going through a split from her husband, Nickelback front man Chad Kroeger? Focus on the mystery intensified in December after a fan Twitter account posted a direct message from Lavigne when she solicited prayers, saying she was "having some health issues." Now the Canadian singer has revealed to People magazine that she was bedridden for five months after contracting Lyme disease. "I felt like I couldn't breathe, I couldn't talk, and I couldn't move," she told the magazine. "I thought I was dying." Lyme disease: What you should know. Lavigne believes that she was bitten by a tick last spring. What followed was months of lightheadedness and lethargy that doctors were initially unable to diagnose. The 30-year-old performer said she recuperated in her Ontario home, where her husband would use tour breaks to care for her and her mother moved in to assist. "There were definitely times I couldn't shower for a full week because I could barely stand," she told People. "It felt like having all your life sucked out of you." Opinion: Why you should be afraid of Lyme disease. After her direct message about her health went viral, Lavigne was inundated with concern from fans. "The get-well messages and videos they sent touched me so deeply," she said. Now declaring herself "80 percent better," Lavigne is releasing a new single this month to support the 2015 Special Olympics and says that being ill was a "wake-up call" that has given her a new perspective. "I really just want to enjoy life from here on out," she said.

Article: A man accused of chopping up his friend's body and dumping his severed head in an apartment block's recycling bin had previously started a bloody fight at his gym, it has emerged. Carlos Colina, 32, is being held on $1 million bail after pleading not guilty to aggravated assault and battery and improper disposal of a human body in Cambridge, Massachusetts on Monday. The remains of Jonathan Camilien, 26, including a torso and limbs, were found in a duffel bag near the campus of Massachusetts Institute of Technology on Saturday morning before his head was found in Colina's apartment building across the street, according to the police report. Now the Boston Herald has unearthed police reports and witness accounts showing Colina had intimidated fellow gym users and even fought them before being thrown out. Accused: Carlos Colina is pictured at his arraignment in Cambridge, Massachusetts on Monday after human body parts were discovered in a duffel bag and a head was found in his building's recycling bin. Colina previously worked out at the Cambridge Athletic Club but was kicked out following a fight over gym equipment on November 24. A witness told the Herald how Colina started punching a much smaller man all over his body as the man unsuccessfully tried to fight back. He suffered bloody cuts to his head, the witness said. 'The trainers broke the fight up,' he said. 'Carlos gets up and starts walking away, yelling, "I'm a beast! I'm a beast!’ like he was proud of himself.' The victim suffered broken ribs in the attack, WHDH reported. Colina has an outstanding assault and battery case pending against him from the fight. The witness said that before the November incident, Colina stood and glared at other gym users if they were using gym equipment he wanted. 'Intimidating': Colina, pictured in photos he posted to Facebook, also has an outstanding assault and battery case pending against him after he allegedly attacked a fellow gym user last November. 'Threats': A witness said Colina had also intimidated other gym users when he wanted to use equipment. Colina is believed to have known his alleged victim; he is friends with his younger brother, Christopher Camilien, on Facebook. The two brothers lived together in Somerville. Middlesex District Attorney Marian Ryan said Camilien's death is considered a homicide, even though Colina has not been charged with murder. She said analysis of evidence and more information from the medical examiner are needed to determine if additional charges are warranted. 'We are not seeking anyone else in connection with the discovery of these human remains,' she said. No motive has been released. Colina and Camilien were last seen returning to the building just after 11pm on Friday, according to the investigation, and a neighbor reported hearing an argument coming from the apartment. Colina was seen in surveillance video from nearby Biogen offices exiting the apartment building at about 4.15am on Saturday carrying a duffel bag, authorities said. Scene: A vacuum could be heard inside his building, pictured, after police discovered the victim's head. Probe: Police stand by where the remains of Jonathan Camilien were discovered in Cambridge on Saturday. He returned to the apartment building empty handed. A saw, rope and cleaning supplies were found in Colina's apartment, which is located one block from the Cambridge Police Department. He also had wounds on his face and neck and a vacuum could be heard during the search when police discovered the victim's head, according to theBoston Globe. Defense attorney John Cunha Jr. called it a sensational case. 'Obviously the circumstances of the case are sensational enough,' he said. 'I'm not going to exacerbate it.' A pretrial hearing has been scheduled for April 14.

Article: For Celtic, a slow-burning season has seen Ronny Deila’s side raise their game after a stuttering start and eventually rout their nearest rivals. Their steady emergence under the Norwegian has seen them swat aside second-placed Aberdeen 8-2 on aggregate over three matches and eradicate fourth-placed Dundee United 17-3 over the course of six games. Yet although the Parkhead side have in recent times looked like an increasingly irresistible force in the race for the treble, it has been left to third-placed Inverness Caley Thistle to enhance their credentials as the team most likely to represent a potential stumbling block on Ronny Deila’s march towards history. Leigh Griffiths (left) fired Celtic into an early lead in their encounter against Inverness. Griffiths runs over to celebrate his opening strike with the travelling Celtic supporters. Griffiths (right) celebrates his third minute goal with his Celtic team-mates, but the lead did not last long. In three games this season, there has been nothing between these two teams. In August, Celtic lost 1-0 at Tulloch Caledonian Stadium, before gaining revenge with a 1-0 win at Parkhead in November. On Saturday, Deila’s side were held to a draw by Caley Thistle. Yet while Celtic were surprisingly poor, the evidence from the weekend also suggests that Inverness possess a potent blend of passion and physicality which, more so than any other side in the country, seems to knock Deila’s men out of their stride. For goalkeeper Craig Gordon, Saturday’s 1-1 draw - which included a quick-fire goal from Leigh Griffiths and one in immediate response Edward Ofere - served as a warning shot against complacency in the quest for a rare domestic clean sweep. The Scotland goalkeeper believes his side will need to fight with every sinew when the two tribes renew hostilities in Sunday’s Scottish Cup semi final at Hampden if Celtic’s dream of winning a fourth treble is not to be shattered. ‘It’s a good little reminder that we are in for a big fight next week,’ said the Scotland international. ‘Inverness are a good team. They are big and physical - but they can also pass the ball. ‘They were up for it and they put us under a bit of pressure today. They’ve got a little bit of everything about them and, on any given day, they are more than capable of winning a game. ‘They pressed us high and they will try to do that again at Hampden. Hopefully we will learn from this and play better. But the one thing we know for sure is that we will be in for a battle next weekend.’ Edward Ofere (left) equalised for Inverness from close range a minute after Griffiths scoring. Ofere (left) wheels away in celebration after swiftly levelling the score for Inverness against Celtic. Celtic found it tough to play on a bumpy surface at the Tulloch Caledonian Stadium. But Gordon reckons the recently re-laid turf at Hampden will benefit Inverness just as much as the treble-chasers. ‘It will be a different venue on a different pitch but that won’t have any bearing,’ he said. ‘The pitch at Hampden will help us but it will be good for Inverness as well because they like to pass the ball about. ‘Both sides were aggressive today in trying to press, there was nothing nasty about it. Everyone was just trying to get one over their direct opponent ahead of the semi final and neither team wanted to lose ahead of next weekend. ‘We all know next weekend is a big one but we’ve also got a midweek league match (against Kilmarnock) at home on Wednesday night sandwiched right in the middle of these two Inverness games. ‘We need to keep picking up points. If we can win against Kilmarnock we can go into the semi-final high on confidence and looking to beat Inverness.’ If Celtic felt ill at ease on a poor pitch and blowing wind, it did not show as the elements played a part in the opening goal after just 135 seconds. The wind held up Scott Brown’s long ball and Griffiths set himself up before blasting past Dean Brill from 25 yards for a terrific goal. Inverness goalkeeper Dean Brill was substituted off injured after 20 minutes against Celtic. Stuart Armstrong of Celtic tackles Ryan Christie of Inverness in Saturday's early Scottish Premiership match. Inverness were level almost straight away, however, when David Raven’s shanked shot was directed goalwards by Ryan Christie. Belgian defender Jason Denayer cleared the ball off the line but only as far as Nigeria forward Ofere, who was there to ram home his second goal for Caley Thistle since joining the club in January. It had been a breathtaking opening five minutes but the next incident of note was a horror show for Brill as the enthusiastic Gary Mackay-Steven chased down a loose ball and accidentally caught the Caley Thistle keeper, who collapsed to the deck in agony. As the keeper was treated by medics on the park, Mackay-Steven kept checking on the welfare of his stricken opponent. Jeered for his role in the incident, Mackay-Steven seemed spooked afterwards and fell out of the game, before being substituted by Kris Commons just after the hour mark. There was precious little else to talk about in the remainder of the match, apart from some decent saves by Brill’s replacement Ryan Esson from Efe Ambrose and Denayer - while Celtic captain Scott Brown was booked for ‘simulation’ after colliding with Raven in the box. Afterwards, Deila backed his man, saying Brown was ‘the last man in the world anyone can accuse of diving.’ Deila added: ‘He is a tough guy. It’s not a big issue.’ Keeper Gordon, meanwhile, tried to remain philosophical over two lost points in a title race which has been going Celtic’s way for quite some time. ‘I think a point was probably fair today. It’s always tough here and you always get a battle,’ he said. ‘That’s pretty much what it was like as the game never really settled down or had any real pattern to it. ‘We couldn’t impose ourselves and do what we wanted to do. The conditions were difficult, but it was the same for them. Both teams created a few opportunities but not too many and a draw was fair. We will need to be better next Sunday if we are to get a result.’

Leigh Griffiths gave Celtic a third minute lead which lasted only 60 seconds. Edward Ofere levelled for Inverness with a close-range finish. Celtic failed to unlock the Inverness defence again and had to take a point.

Article: Glowing tributes were paid yesterday to cricketing legend Richie Benaud, after his death at 84 from skin cancer. At Lord’s, MCC flags were lowered, and the Australian government offered a state funeral for the man who never lost a Test series as his country’s captain, then became a commentator. David Cameron said he had ‘grown up listening to Richie Benaud’s wonderful cricket commentary’, while his Australian counterpart Tony Abbott called it ‘a sad day for Australia’. Retiring as a player in 1964, Benaud’s masterful analysis was universally revered. Here, we reproduce a tribute paid by the Mail’s brilliant sports columnist IAN WOOLDRIDGE — which he wrote in 2005 after coverage of live international cricket in England switched from terrestrial to satellite TV, depriving cricket fans of Benaud’s voice... Richie Benaud in the commentary box at the Oval for the final test of the 2005 Ashes. Thereafter international cricket fans in England lost his genius when live game switched from terrestrial to satellite TV. So it is farewell, then, to the Master of Measured Words. Richie Benaud will not be returning to England next summer to sustain his pre-eminence as cricket’s finest commentator. That is not merely my judgment. A recent poll by The Wisden Cricketer magazine attracted an astonishing 12,000 votes. Precisely 10,128 of them nominated Benaud as the best. Fortunately, he does not leave us without a word or several of advice to those who seek to emulate his success, particularly retired players whose agents deem them instantly equipped to pick up a microphone and irritate us with an effluent of Tower of Babel verbiage. He does so in a valedictory book which is an encyclopaedia of broadcasting wisdom. He names no names. He is too polite for that. Nor is there a hint of the tetchiness that occasionally afflicts icons in their pensionable years. At 74, Benaud is still as fit as a flea, the result of a lifestyle as measured as his commentating. Yes, there are rare occasions when he will let down his hair with the rest of us, but when serious business is afoot he will rise from an increasingly raucous dinner party, check his watch that it is exactly 10pm and announce: ‘Thank you very much. We’re off.’ At sunrise next morning, he and Daphne, his elegant and unfailingly supportive English wife, will be striding out on their three-mile constitutional. Benaud representing Australia in 1961. He led his country as captain in 28 of his 63 Tests and never lost a series. He is meticulous in all things. On TV commentary days, even Daphne is not allowed to iron his shirts. He presses them himself. He is a food faddist, preparing his Test match lunch boxes at home to be certain of what he is eating. Once, he took a week-long course in Italy to learn how to cook pasta to perfection. His desks at his homes in London, South of France and Sydney are polished plateaux of precision, his reference-book shelves indexed for instant reach. It is this unrelenting self-discipline, instilled by a schoolmaster and great club cricketer father and a lovely mother — there is a gorgeous picture of her celebrating her 100th birthday with Richie and his Test cricketer brother John in the book — that launched him into his dual career life. The first, of course, was in cricket, where to haul oneself from school, to club, to State, the Australian team and then its captaincy was a classic climb. Benaud led his country in 28 of his 63 Tests and never lost a series. Such was his cunning as a wrist-spinner that his batsmanship was often overlooked. In fact, he became the first, in an era when far fewer Tests were played, to scale the double of 200 wickets and 2,000 runs. But what next? All of seven years before he retired from cricket, Benaud wondered if there could be a distant future in the communication industry. There was little doubt about that since he had been a young crime reporter on a Sydney newspaper, where sub-editors ruthlessly deleted from his copy any flowery phrases which he thought rather good but were irrelevant to the story. It was an important lesson. Then a curious opportunity, which couldn’t happen in today’s schedules, presented itself. At the end of Australia’s 1956 tour to England, all their players were given three weeks off to enjoy such fleshpots of relaxation as they could discover in the British Isles. Australian captain Richie Benaud takes on the MCC in the first innings at Brisbane on December 5, 1958. Benaud proceeded otherwise. At his own expense he moved from the Kensington Palace Hotel into a cramped lower ground room in the RAC club in Pall Mall and took a BBC television training course, alongside directors, commentators, even audiences, to learn how television worked. He trailed Peter O’Sullevan at Newbury and he studied the commentating techniques of Henry Longhurst on golf and Dan Maskell on tennis. All three had their idiosyncrasies, but one thing they had in common. O’Sullevan, voice rising to overdrive at the climax of a horse race, was circumspect about collateral chatter, just as Longhurst and ‘Oh I say’ Maskell knew the value of golden silence. Indeed, one of Longhurst’s silences was so long that his director asked over the private intercom: ‘Excuse me, Henry, but are you still alive?’ Benaud now says: ‘I didn’t know if I had a future in broadcasting. If I hadn’t done that BBC course my life would have been very different, even though I had to wait for seven years for my chance. ‘The key feature it taught me was the economy of words. Never insult the viewers by telling them what they have seen perfectly clearly themselves. Only add to it if you had something pertinent to say.’ Benaud rings the bell on the pavilion balcony on the second day of the second test between England and Australia at Lord's during the 2009 Ashes. These days if only. Has he ever made a bloomer? Of course, like all of us, he has. On one celebrated occasion, handing over from a Test match for a news update from Moira Stuart, he called her Moira Shearer, the celebrated ballerina who had starred in an acclaimed film. When Moira Stuart handed back he said: ‘Thanks, Moira, our newsreader wearing Red Shoes.’ Many, who had not heard his initial blunder, wondered what on earth he was on about. ‘At the time,’ he recalls, ‘I thought it was a pretty clever remark, but many tuning in at that moment had no idea what it meant. It taught me never to be such a smart-arse again.’ Laconic, economic, massively instructive and with a dry impartial wit about whoever is getting the upper hand in a Test match, I wonder if we shall ever hear his like again on television? Many are called and surprisingly many are given the opportunity behind the microphone. Very few have served the slogging apprenticeship that makes a master cricket commentator.

Article: Jack Nicklaus recorded his first ever hole-in-one at the Masters on Wednesday, as Camilo Villegas fired two in the space of five holes but still could not win the traditional par-three contest. Villegas holed out on the fourth and eighth as he finished alongside Kevin Streelman on five under par, only to find water on the eighth when he played it again as the third play-off hole. Kevin Streelman holds his trophy aloft after winning the Par-3 Contest on a play-off against Camilo Villegas. Streelman therefore became the latest player to be saddled with the 'curse' of the par-three champion, with no player ever becoming par-three and Masters champion in the same year. However, that was placed firmly into perspective thanks to his 11-year-old caddie Ethan Couch, who has a benign but inoperable brain tumour. Streelman found Couch via the Make-a-Wish Foundation and invited him to be his caddie in the light-hearted curtain-raiser. Augusta National's par-three course traditionally hosts the contest the day before start of the major. 'It was a really fun day, especially to have Ethan with me here,' Streelman said. 'This isn't about me today. It's about helping him out and showing him a great day.' Villegas said: 'I've made a few hole-in-ones, but it's pretty special to make them here. The second one, we were a little more emotional there. We just kind of jumped.' Nicklaus had earlier holed out with an eight iron from 123 yards on the fourth, his ball landing around 15 feet past the pin and spinning back into the hole. Woods played in the Masters par-three contest at Augusta National for the first time in 11 years. That took the 75-year-old six-time champion to three under par, but he would bogey the fifth and hit two balls into the water on the ninth to end his hopes of an unlikely triumph. Former US Open champion Curtis Strange reminded Nicklaus of the tradition that players who make a hole-in-one have to buy the drinks in the clubhouse when Nicklaus walked past the ESPN commentary position. 'Send me a bill,' Nicklaus replied. The Masters official Twitter account shared an image of Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods with Niall Horan. The 18-time major winner added on ESPN: 'I never had a hole in one at Augusta, in the par three (contest) or on the golf course. Doing an interview this morning I said all I have to do is go out there, make a hole-in-one and win the par three. I had it three under and then choked.' Since the contest started in 1960, nobody has ever become par-three and Masters champion in the same week, a fact which sometimes sees players deliberately not shoot the best score possible. Most treat it as light relief and invite family or friends to act as their caddies, including Tiger Woods this year for the first time since 2004. Woods had his children Charlie and Sam on his bag and made sure he could not win the event by getting daughter Sam to tap in for par on the sixth. Jack Nicklaus (centre) with Ben Crenshaw (left) and Gary Player (right) during the Par-3 Contest. 'We had an absolutely great time. These were memories for a lifetime,' said Woods, who was also accompanied by girlfriend Lindsey Vonn. He later added on Twitter: 'I'll always have memories of my pop at Augusta and now Sam & Charlie. An amazing day.' Tournament favourite Rory McIlroy had One Direction singer Niall Horan acting as his caddie and Horan proved he should stick to singing after badly hooking a tee shot on the ninth into the water. 'I apologise to golf,' Horan joked. 'I do perform to a lot of people but we were performing to their parents today! There was a lot of pressure.' McIlroy, who is looking to become the sixth player to complete the career grand slam by winning a first Masters title on Sunday, added: 'I wanted to do this because it's a big week for me and just to go into the tournament in a relaxed mood. To spend a couple of hours like this was fun.'

Article: Barcelona coach Luis Enrique has sought to play down Neymar's petulant reaction when the Brazil forward was substituted in Saturday's 2-2 La Liga draw at Sevilla. Neymar, who scored a superb free kick to make it 2-0 to Barca after Lionel Messi's opener, was clearly furious at being replaced by Xavi with around 20 minutes left and Spanish media speculated he might be dropped for Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final, first leg at Paris St Germain. Luis Enrique declined to reveal who would start the match at the Parc des Princes but did make it clear that he was the one in charge and urged all his players to respect that. Luis Enrique has played down Neymar's angry reaction to be substituted against Sevilla. Neymar (left) speaks with Brazilian team-mates Adriano (centre) and   Rafinha during a training session. Barcelona face Chelsea' conquerors Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday in the Champions League. 'I haven't seen the footage,' Luis Enrique told reporters after he was asked about television images showing Neymar complaining to his team mates on the bench. 'As a coach I understand that all the players want to be on the pitch,' he added. 'And the players must understand that I am the coach and I have to make decisions. Beyond that you can speculate and draw the conclusions you want.' Asked again about Neymar's behaviour later in the news conference, Luis Enrique drew laughter by taking the chance to wish his mother a happy birthday. Luis Suarez (centre) and Gerard Pique joke around during the session at the Parcs des Princes Stadium. Messi (centre) takes part in a drill and the forward will need to be in top form to beat the French champions. Barca and PSG have already met twice in the Champions League group stage this term, with the Ligue 1 side winning 3-2 in Paris and Barca's 3-1 success at the Nou Camp helping them finish as pool winners. Barca are in the last eight of Europe's elite club competition for a record eighth season in a row, while PSG are seeking a last-four place for the second time, having lost to AC Milan in 1994-95 after beating Barca in the quarter-finals. PSG's hopes of making the semi-finals have been hit by suspensions and injury, with Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Italy midfielder Marco Verratti banned and midfielder Thiago Motta out with a thigh injury. The three-time Ballon d'Or winner looks on as his Barcelona team-mates take part in a heading drill. Brazil centre back David Luiz has been sidelined with a hamstring problem, but has been included in the squad for Wednesday's match. 'Obviously they have some players missing, we cannot hide that, but if we remember the group game when Ibrahimovic wasn't playing they beat us,' Luis Enrique said. 'Then when Ibrahimovic was playing in Barcelona we were able to beat them. 'They are important players for them without doubt but they have a strong squad and for sure they will cause us problems.' The return leg is in Barcelona on April 21. Neymar (centre) controls the ball during a training session at the Parc des Princes stadium.

Article: Sevilla coach Unai Emery is one of the more eccentric characters in La Liga but the Andalusian club's success this season suggests there is plenty of method in the Basque-born 43-year-old's apparent madness. Prowling the touchline during games, Emery's frantic arm gestures, wild eyes and bellowed commands clearly inspire his players rather than distract them. Sevilla are fifth in La Liga ahead of the visit of leaders Barcelona on Saturday. Sevilla coach Unai Emery has guided the club to fifth in the La Liga table ahead of the visit of Barcelona. Emery is one of the most animated coaches in La Liga and is often seen gesturing on the touchline. 'Since he arrived there has been a clear upwards trend,' midfielder Vicente Iborra said of Emery, who joined Sevilla in January 2013, on the club's radio station on Wednesday. 'Those who know him know that he lives for football and for his club, with all the responsibility that brings. 'And the important thing is that it rubs off on us. Having a coach and training staff like that is to be valued, it's not easy and we have to, and will, make the most of it.' Jose Antonio Reyes (centre) is congratulated after scoring the winner in Monday's victory over Levante. Emery roars with delight as his Sevilla side claimed a 2-1 victory at the Ciutat de Valencia Stadium. After a run of five straight victories they are well placed to secure at least a berth in the Europa League, the competition they won last season and are still alive in this term. They may even pip Atletico Madrid and Valencia to a Champions League berth. Barca lead on 74 points with eight games left, with Real Madrid, who play at Eibar on Saturday, second on 70 and Atletico, who are away at Malaga, third on 65. Valencia and Sevilla each have 61 points in fourth and fifth, although Valencia have played one game fewer and have an away match at Athletic Bilbao later on Thursday before hosting city rivals Levante on Monday. Emery took over at Sevilla in  2013 and has overseen a 'clear upwards trend', according to Vicente Iborra. Barcelona, pictured celebrating during the 4-0 win over Almeria, travel to Sevilla on Saturday. Barca, Real and Atletico all play on Saturday as they are in Champions League action next week. Barca play their quarter-final, first leg at Paris St Germain on Wednesday and Atletico host Real in a repeat of last season's final the previous day. Sevilla play their Europa League quarter-final, first leg at home to Zenit St Petersburg on Thursday. At the other end of the La Liga table, Almeria host Granada in an all-Andalusian relegation battle on Saturday, before fellow strugglers Cordoba and Elche meet on Sunday. Cordoba avoided equalling the La Liga record for the most consecutive defeats of 11 thanks to Wednesday's 1-1 draw at Deportivo La Coruna but remain five points adrift of Granada at the bottom and appear doomed for the drop.

Article: Washington (CNN)Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the deal six world powers struck to thwart Iran's nuclear ambitions, saying he sees better options than "this bad deal or war." "I think there's a third alternative, and that is standing firm, ratcheting up the pressure until you get a better deal," Netanyahu told CNN's Jim Acosta Sunday on "State of the Union." His comments come as Democrats and Republicans spar over the framework announced last week to lift Western sanctions on Iran in exchange for the country dropping from 19,000 to 5,060 active centrifuges, limiting its highly enriched uranium, and increasing inspections. President Barack Obama endorsed the deal, saying it was better than the alternatives. But GOP contenders for the party's 2016 presidential nomination lambasted it, saying it gave Iran too much flexibility. On Sunday, the sparring continued. One Senate Democrat said Netanyahu needs to "contain himself." And a top Republican said almost any of Obama's successors as president "could do better." Netanyahu's most recent argument against the Iran nuclear deal was similar to the one he'd made in a March trip to Washington, when he addressed a joint session of Congress -- fueling a Republican push to have the deal sent to Congress before it's implemented. "It does not roll back Iran's nuclear program. It keeps a vast nuclear infrastructure in place. Not a single centrifuge is destroyed. Not a single nuclear facility is shut down, including the underground facilities that they built illicitly. Thousands of centrifuges will keep spinning, enriching uranium," Netanyahu said Sunday. "That's a very bad deal. " Netanyahu said Iran is a country of "congenital cheating" and that it can't be trusted to abide by the terms of the deal, which lasts 10 years with some provisions extending well beyond that. He said his opposition has little to do with his frosty relationship with Obama. "I think that we can have a legitimate difference of opinion on this, because I think Iran has shown to be completely distrustful," Netanyahu said. Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, meanwhile, said she wishes Netanyahu "would contain himself." The top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee said negotiators working on the deal -- from Iran and the United States, as well as Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany -- are "on the cusp of something that can be workable." "It's a framework. It has to be wrapped into a final agreement. There still can be some changes," Feinstein said. "But I don't think it's helpful for Israel to come out and oppose this one opportunity to change a major dynamic -- which is downhill, a downhill dynamic in this part of the world." Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz defended the deal in an appearance on CBS' "Face the Nation" on Sunday, saying it would extend from two months to one year the "breakout" time period -- the length of time it would take Iran to build a nuclear bomb. He said it also allows for the "almost instantaneous recognition of any attempt to evade the deal." "We have blocked all of these pathways to a bomb," he said. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said on "Face the Nation" that the best option for the United States is to keep current sanctions in place for two more years and then have a "new crack at it with a new president that doesn't have the baggage of Obama." And he said the alternatives to Obama on both sides -- with the exception of Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who's called for a less active U.S. role overseas -- would likely strike a better deal. "Hillary Clinton would do better. I think everybody on our side, except, maybe, Rand Paul, could do better," Graham said.

Article: As seasons go, this one has been pretty close to perfect for Bristol City. Runaway leaders in Sky Bet League One, they became the first team in the Football League to mathematically secure promotion on Tuesday night - and in sensational style. Hitting Bradford City for six of the best in their own backyard saw them triumphantly over the finishing line, although given their free-wheeling and free-scoring form the result really came as little surprise. Aden Flint celebrates with a bottle of Sky Bet champagne following Bristol City's promotion. City players are sprayed with champagne after securing promotion from League One. And there’s more. Add to that their memorable Johnstone’s Paint Trophy victory at Wembley last month - when Walsall were comfortably beaten 2-0 in the final - and you have a truly historic campaign for Steve Cotterill’s team. The season has been a personal triumph for tall, tattooed defender Aden Flint, who has played a central role in returning City to the Championship after two seasons away. His uncompromising defensive style has been combined with a knack of scoring from set-pieces, leading to 11 goals this season. Flint was on target at Wembley, fulfilling a childhood dream in the process, and also at Valley Parade on Tuesday. The Robins stars shower each other in their isotonic drinks following victory against Bradford City on Tuesday. Flint scores his side's fourth goal of the game as City earn an impressive 6-0 at Valley Parade. ‘When the players and the manager sat down at the start of the season, we had three aims,’ he tells Sportsmail. ‘The first was to win promotion back to the Championship, the second was to go up as champions and the third was to win the Johnstone's Paint Trophy. ‘We've managed to do two of the three and hopefully on Saturday we can achieve the other.’ That’s because City need another win to make absolutely sure they will be promoted as champions. The 25-year-old defender celebrates as the Robins earned promotion to the Championship in style. City manager Steve Cotterill celebrates promotion with a commemorative bottle of champagne. They currently lead Preston North End by 10 points but the Lancashire side have a game in hand and so three points are required against Coventry City at Ashton Gate this weekend. ‘Nobody wants that runners-up medal. The aim was always to go up as champions and we’re close to achieving that,’ Flint says. ‘We’ve had that winning habit and it’s a good one to get in to. We’ve been top of the league for most of the season and to drop down to second now would be disappointing.’ Seldom does one team dominate a division in this way. The lowest City have been placed is fifth and that was after their opening day fixture. The Robins have enjoyed a memorable season which has included lifting the Johnstone's Paint Trophy. Once again, Flint (right) made a huge contribution, giving City the lead against Walsall on March 22. Flint wheels away in celebration after sending his side on their way to another memorable victory. Cotterill (left) and Jay Emmanuel-Thomas look delighted as they celebrate with the trophy at Wembley. They kicked on from there and set a ferocious pace throughout the autumn. Since September 13th, there has only been one week when they haven’t been top of the pile and they have lost just three games in all competitions since the New Year. Not that success has been reserved for the league. They reached the fourth round of the FA Cup, losing narrowly to Premier League West Ham, and claimed the Trophy too in front of over 40,000 of their fans at Wembley. Flint said: ‘I think any player dreams of scoring and winning at Wembley. There really isn't a better feeling in football. It is right up there with the highlights in my career but I would say that if we win on Saturday and go up as champions, that will push Wembley out.’ The defender’s goalscoring exploits have come as a surprise but he’s quick to credit his team-mates for the service: ‘I didn't expect to score as many as five to be honest! Flint holds the JPT with pride as he celebrates the 2-0 victory against Walsall last month. The defender was also named the Sky Bet League 1 Player of the Month for March. ‘I've just found myself in the right place at the right time to get on the end of all those set-pieces that have been delivered by the lads. ‘Aaron Wilbraham has bags of experience with him and has scored over 20 goals this season. Luke Freeman and Marlon Pack have been providing plenty of assists, not just for me but for everyone. ‘But everyone has chipped in, it has been a collective effort. The team spirit here has been the best I've ever experienced and it's been an enjoyable season.’ Promotion back to the Championship could be just the beginning of an exciting chapter in the club’s 118-year history. Aaron Wilbraham (right) has scored 18 domestic goals for the high-flying Robins this season. Billionaire owner Steve Lansdown (left) is funding a renovation of the club’s Ashton Gate home. Billionaire owner Steve Lansdown, who made his fortune in financial services, is funding a renovation of the club’s Ashton Gate home to expand the capacity to 27,000 and make it Premier League-ready. And, according to Flint, that’s precisely where the club is aiming: ‘We aim high and should be in the Championship, if not higher than that. ‘It's a massive city, I didn't realise how big it is until I moved here. It's surprising that the place hasn't got a Premier League team and maybe we can change that. ‘The chairman and the manager certainly have the ambition to achieve that. Seeing Bournemouth and Brentford doing so well in the Championship, nobody expected that and, who knows what will happen when we get there next season.’

Bristol City have earned promotion to the Championship. 25-year-old Aden Flint has been crucial to their promotion push. Flint has chipped in with an impressive 11 goals so far this season.

Article: Leeds Rhinos have sent full back Zak Hardaker on an anger management course after a student was left with two black eyes and bruising during a violent incident in February. Hardaker was at the centre of a police assault probe into an attack on a 22-year-old man at student flats in Leeds, but was not charged with any offence. Leeds issued a lengthy statement outlining Hardaker's punishment, which will also see him forfeit one month's salary to be donated to a local charity and do up to 20 hours a week of voluntary work for the club's foundation for the duration of his contract. Hardaker and team-mate Elliot Minchella both paid £200 in compensation and wrote a letter of apology to a 22-year-old man following a police investigation but Leeds said Hardaker's punishment is far stronger 'given his previous misconduct'. Leeds Rhinos have sent full back Zak Hardaker (centre with the ball) on an anger management course. The one-cap England international received a five-match ban and a fine for a homophobic comment made last year and was also fined by England for breaching team discipline during the 2013 World Cup. The statement from Leeds read: 'The club has accepted his apology for his actions, however, given his previous misconduct, Zak has realised that it is his actions rather than his words that must now show his intentions to put these events behind him.' It went on: 'We have passed the point of telling him what he has to do, however, for the first time Zak has admitted to us and, more importantly to himself, that he has an issue with aspects of his lifestyle which he wants to improve. 'We have listened to what he has committed to do for himself and we will support him.' Minchella received a written warning and a fine of 50 per cent of his monthly salary, while team-mates Rob Mulhern, Josh Walters and Ash Handley were fined and issued verbal warnings. Police said the student received two black eyes and a bruised neck during the incident. Hardaker received a five-match ban and a fine for a homophobic comment made last year. Leeds Rhinos have today issued the following statement relating to an incident which happened in the city earlier this year that was brought into the public spotlight:. 'The Leeds Rhinos Players Code of Conduct prohibits players from visiting licensed premises after midnight without prior permission from me or the Head Coach. Our investigation has revealed this regulation was breached by five players on a midweek evening before the start of this season. Furthermore Zak Hardaker and Elliot Minchella were involved in an incident at a student accommodation building, which led to a police investigation and a written apology from both players to a student and a £200 compensation payment from Hardaker and Minchella. 'Our internal investigation has now concluded. It has been an exhaustive process and we are always disappointed when players fall below the standards we expect of them and let everyone else down. The players themselves are embarrassed and very apologetic and I am sure it has been a lesson learned for all involved. 'Rob Mulhern, Josh Walters and Ash Handley have each received a fine and a verbal warning. Elliot Minchella has received a written warning and a fine of 50% of his monthly salary. 'With regard to Zak Hardaker, the club has accepted his apology for his actions, however, given his previous misconduct, Zak has realized that it is his actions rather than his words that must now show his intentions to put these events behind him. Therefore, we have agreed the following actions:. 1) Zak will forfeit one months salary and this will be donated to support a local charity project. 2) He will enroll on a course for anger management. 3) Zak will work as a volunteer for up to 20 hours a week for the duration of his Rhinos contract to assist the Leeds Rhinos Foundation and Marketing Department. 'Zak is full of passion and enthusiasm and has many qualities that are to be admired in a young player but a small part of him has led to problems and this has to be addressed, not only for the image of the game but most importantly for Zak’s own well being and his ability to fulfil his potential. We have passed the point of telling him what he has to do, however, for the first time Zak has admitted to us and, more importantly to himself, that he has an issue with aspects of his lifestyle which he wants to improve. We have listened to what he has committed to do for himself and we will support him.'

Article: Marcelo insists Real Madrid's this season's meetings with local rivals Atletico Madrid will have no bearing on the outcome of their Champions League quarter-final tie. The reigning champions face Diego Simeone's side at Vicente Calderon on Tuesday night in the first leg of the last eight clash having failed to beat their neighbours in six attempts this season. Carlo Ancelotti's side lost both La Liga matches against Atletico this season - 2-1 at the Bernabeu before a humiliating 4-0 away defeat - and have also been beaten twice and held to two draws in the Spanish Supper Cup and the Copa del Rey. Marcelo says Real Madrid's failure to beat Atletico in six attempts this season will have no affect on their Champions League quarter-final tie. Marcelo and Cristiano Ronaldo looked relaxed in training on Monday ahead of Tuesday's first leg. Brazil international Marcelo faces the media on Monday ahead of Tuesday's match at Vicente Calderon. But Brazil international Marcelo says he and his team-mates are not thinking about their recent form against Tuesday's opponents. 'We have played against Atletico a lot and something always changes,' Marcelo told reporters at a press conference on Monday. There are no favourites in a match like this. We will give everything on the pitch without thinking about previous games.' 'They are a great team. They never stop fighting and they are very intense. But we are not thinking about the last games against them. Now is completely different. We have two games to show that we can beat them.' Ronaldo and Bale leave the field dejected after Real Madrid were beaten 4-0 by Atletico in February. The last time Real Madrid beat their local rivals was in the Champions League final last season. Carlo Ancelotti and Marcelo task questions at the pre-match press conference. 'We have to go out and give everything on the pitch this time. We will have to be very intense. We will have to fight. These derbies are very difficult.' The last time Real beat Atletico was in last season's Champions League final when Sergio Ramos scored in the 93rd minute to take the game to extra-time, before Gareth Bale, Marcelo and Cristiano Ronaldo made it 4-1. 'I don't know how many times we have spoken about Ramos' Decima goal this week,' Marcelo added. 'I was available for the final and I never lost faith in helping the team. That's what happened and I was able to help the team win the Champions League. I consider myself very important in this team.'

Article: (CNN)Standing up for what you believe. What does it cost you? What do you gain? Memories Pizza in the Indiana town of Walkerton is finding out. The family-run restaurant finds itself at the center of the debate over the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act after its owners said they'd refuse to cater a same-sex couple's wedding. "If a gay couple was to come and they wanted us to bring pizzas to their wedding, we'd have to say no," Crystal O'Connor told CNN affiliate WBND-TV in South Bend. The statement struck at the heart of fears by critics, who said the new law would allow businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbians. They called for boycotts. But supporters also rallied. And by the end of the week, they had donated more than $842,000 for the business. Social media unloaded on the pizzeria in the community of 2,100 people that few folks outside northern Indiana knew existed before this week. RiskyLiberal tweeted: "Dear #MemoriesPizza. No. My boycotting your business because I don't like your religious bigotry is not a violation of your freedom to practice your religion." "Don't threaten #MemoriesPizza" tweeted Aღanda. "Just mock them for their ignorance." Bad reviews flooded the restaurant's Facebook page, most having little to do with the quality of the food.  Many too vulgar to share. "Do you really want to financially support a company that treats some of your fellow citizens like second class citizens? BOYCOTT MEMORIES PIZZA!!" said Rob Katz of Indianapolis.  "Let's hope they either rethink their policy or the free market puts them out of business." Anti-bigotry critics harass wrong pizzeria. But one outburst in particular shut down the restaurant Wednesday and was expected to do the same Thursday. "Who's going to Walkerton with me to burn down Memories Pizza?" Jessica Dooley of Goshen tweeted, according to the Walkerton Police Department. The account has been deleted since the tweet was posted. Detectives who investigated have recommended charges of harassment, intimidation and threats, according to Charles Kulp, assistant police chief. The mood was a bit more subdued on the streets of Walkerton. A man stood outside Memories simply holding a sign that reads "bigots." Jason Narducy bought $100 of pizza from another shop down the street and started handing it out, WBND reported. "Do you want some non-discriminatory pizza?" Narducy asked. But for every tweet and Facebook post taking Memories Pizza to task were words of support and a groundswell of financial support. "Because nothing says tolerance like threatening to kill Christians & burn down their businesses," said a tweet from Victor Nikki. "What's happening to #MemoriesPizza isn't the free market, it's a lynch mob," tweeted Savannah. "Cyber bulling isn't the same as taking your business elsewhere." Supporters rallied to a GoFundMe page in support of Memories Pizza. By the time the fundraiser ended late Friday, $842,387 had been raised. The purpose of the campaign is "to relieve the financial loss endured by the proprietors' stand for faith," according to  Lawrence Billy Jones II, the man who started it. For the O'Connors their stand was no pie in the sky dream. It wasn't calculated but was spurred by their beliefs, they told WBND. "That's a lifestyle that you choose. I choose to be heterosexual. They choose to be homosexual," Kevin O'Connor told the TV station. "You can't beat me over the head with something they choose to be." Faced with threats against business, they're still weighing the cost. CNN's Rob Frehse and Melanie Whitley contributed to this report.

The club's chief negotiator has jetted to South America to finalise a deal for the 16-year-old forward - who has been compared to Lionel Messi. The Gunners are in advanced talks with Velez Sarsfield over a £4.5million swoop for the teenage sensation. Arsenal are close to signing 16-year-old Maxi Romero from Velez Sarsfield for £4.5million. But the deal has been held up by red-tape over the make-up of Romero's ownership rights - and Law has travelled to Argentina to resolve the issues. Romero's agents and his club Velez both own stakes in the player, which is causing complications for Arsenal. The Premier League have strict rules regarding third-party ownership and the issue must be settled before he can play for the Gunners. Romero is expected to remain with Velez, on loan, for at least two more seasons before coming to England to begin his career with Arsenal. The youngster is yet to make his senior debut for Velez, but has trained regularly with the first team. The Argentine wonderkid has been dubbed the next Lionel Messi and would stay at Velez on loan.

Article: Sport's propensity to play mind games with its protagonists was rarely more obviously stated than after qualifying for the Chinese Grand Prix, when Nico Rosberg cursed his Mercedes team. Hamilton, the world champion, was relaxed and delighted having taken pole but Rosberg, his team-mate, was grim-faced, demoralised and made his first public criticism of his team. Nico Rosberg will start behind pole-sitter Lewis Hamilton with Sebastian Vettel third on the grid in China. Rosberg cut a frustrated figure in the paddock after he missed out on pole to Hamilton by just 0.042secs. Rosberg was only four-hundredths of a second behind the Briton and will start second on the grid. Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari is third, nearly a second adrift of Hamilton. But Rosberg was visibly angry after the Mercedes pit-wall brains put him under unnecessary ‘pressure’. The German was the last driver out for his final flying lap, meaning he had to rush to get in a competitive time. Rosberg, who is customarily gracious in defeat, fell slightly short of Hamilton’s mark and was grumpy afterwards. He said: ‘It was not ideal to put me under pressure like that. I don’t think it cost me anything, but even the mind-set to know that I have to speed up a bit — we need to look into that. Sparks fly off the back of Rosberg's Mercedes during qualifying for Sunday's race in Shanghai. The German has now been out-qualified by Hamilton at each of the three races this season. ‘Other than that the lap was good  and it is very annoying as the lap is never perfect, so four hundredths is always in it. Tyre degradation is going to be a big issue for the race as we are going to take the tyres right to the limit. So there are many opportunities.’ Poor old Rosberg was cock of the walk in the early and middle parts of last season, but he seems terribly lacklustre since Hamilton won the title. Even his Mercedes boss, Niki Lauda, said he should ‘sort himself out’ — a statement on Rosberg’s psyche rather than his work ethic. Whether he has the speed to match Hamilton may be at the centre of his anger. The Briton set his fastest time on his penultimate lap. It was enough. Rosberg, though, got closer to Hamilton than he has recently. McLaren will again be towards the back of the grid with Jenson Button 17th and Fernando Alonso 18th. Barely a hair’s breadth separated the former champions. Button said: ‘I guess we hoped we might be just a bit closer than we were today. In practice, we’d looked a bit more competitive, certainly. ‘We’d found a reasonably good balance with the car, in fact, but the lap-time isn’t quite there yet.’ Hamilton will start from the front of the pack as he bids to win his fourth grand prix in China.

Nico Rosberg was the last driver out of the pit-lane and was forced to turn in a quicker out-lap than he would have liked ahead of his final shot at pole. The German narrowly lost out  to his team-mate Lewis Hamilton. Rosberg was just 0.042secs slower than his Mercedes rival. Rosberg also said: 'Oh, come on, guys', over the team radio after he was informed he'd missed out on pole for Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix.

Article: How good to welcome Padraig Harrington back to Augusta after a year’s absence, complete with his weird and wonderful practice-ground routines. On Friday, he was at it again, but my favourite moment remains his plaintive lament after a mediocre round: ‘I’m focusing so much on my focus I’m over-focused.’ Padraig Harrington hits a tee shot on the fourth hole during the second day of the Masters on Friday. METH ON THE RISE. Headline writers everywhere will be keeping fingers crossed that golf continues to prove an addiction for the highly rated US Public Links champion Byron Meth, who opened with a 74 on his Masters debut. As for the golfing scribes, we’re just waiting for the blessed day when he meets a lovely girl called Crystal. Byron Meth makes a chip shot on the second hole as the American amateur continues to impress at Augusta. PAR FOUR PROBLEMS. The stats from a brilliant day one made fascinating reading. The par fives are the scoring holes and lived up to their billing since all of them had a scoring average under the regulation mark. The par fours, though, are where you hang on. Half had a scoring average of 4.2 or higher, with the 11th yielding just three birdies all day. TAKING POETIC LICENSE. Top marks to the Augusta Chronicle columnist who wrote a poem about the merchandise pavilion in the 1990s so good he decided to share it with his readers again on Friday. ‘They came, they saw, they bought souvenirs,’ it begins. I know how terribly disappointed you’ll be that space permits me from sharing with you the 23 stanzas that followed. Jordan Spieth marks his ball in the 15th hole during the second round of action at Augusta. NICKLAUS OR ‘99’? In addition to being able to buy an Arnold Palmer as your drink of choice in Augusta you can now have Jack Nicklaus ice cream for dessert. No word yet, however, on when Bubba Watson’s Marmite or Ben Crenshaw’s treacle hits the shelves. As for Tiger Woods, he’ll surely launch his own iced lolly soon. Jack Nicklaus waves to the crowd before hitting off on the first tee during the honorary starters ceremony. AUGUSTA SEES REDS. It is not just former Liverpool captain Jamie Redknapp who’s enjoying these sacred acres this week but the club’s greatest ever player as well. I’m going to guess mad-keen golfer Kenny Dalglish was quite happy when wife Marina produced tickets as an anniversary present. Patrons watch the play at the 16th hole during a thrilling second day of play in Augusta.

Article: (CNN)Police in the Indian city of Malegaon, in the western state of Maharashtra, are requiring identity cards for an unusual group of residents: Cattle. Following a recent state-wide ban on the sale and consumption of beef, authorities in the city have asked residents to take a'mugshot' of their cattle and submit it to the police. Along with the photograph, the residents have to give information about their animal's 'unique features,' such as the coloring and age of the cow, along with the length of its tail and other distinctive characteristics. Police officials believe this is the only way to solve cow slaughter cases and enforce the law. Cows are considered holy and revered by that state's majority Hindu population. "We are creating a database. If we get an information of a cow slaughter, we can quickly go to the resident's place and check whether it is there or not", Mahesh Sawai, Deputy Superintendent of Malegaon Police told CNN. "I believe this will be very effective" So far over 100 owners have complied with the police order and more are lining up outside police stations across the city to get their livestock photographed. The ruling came in the wake of a recent case of cow slaughter in Malegaon, where two men have been charged for killing the animal and and selling its meat. The Maharashtra Animal Preservation Bill now includes bans on the killing of bulls and bullocks in its list of non-bailable offenses. Even the consumption or sale of beef could now land you in prison for five years. The slaughter of buffaloes, however, is still permissible. However, beef traders in the country strongly reacted to the decision and called a month-long strike, which ended Wednesday. The traders refused to even slaughter buffaloes and deprive the state of all bovine meat. They have now vowed to file a case in the state's high court. Red meat lovers weren't too delighted either, arguing the government doesn't have a right to interfere in an individual's personal preference. Maharashtra is not the only Indian state to tighten its laws on cow slaughter. Haryana state has implemented a maximum punishment of 10 years in prison, the toughest penalty in the country. Rajnath Singh, India's Home Minister has promised that he would do all to devise a country-wide law against cow slaughter.

Article: Classical singer Camilla Kerslake was centre of attention at Sunday's Olivier Awards after she suffered a wardrobe malfunction as she arrived with England rugby skipper boyfriend Chris Robshaw. Wearing a daring, backless black dress, Camilla, 26, showed off more than she bargained for in her revealing floor-length gown. Despite being accompanied by Robshaw, who played for Harlequins in their 29-26 Premiership victory over Gloucester 24 hours earlier, the cameras were firmly trained on the singer. Scroll down for video. Daring: Camilla Kerslake showed off more than she bargained for in a daring backless gown at the Olivier Awards with MasterCard in London on Sunday where she was accompanied by Chris Robshaw. Posing with their arms around each other, the 'pre-engaged' couple looked the picture of happiness. 'Chris and I are on the same page and we definitely plan to get married in the near future,' the singer recently told The Mail on Sunday in her first interview about her famous boyfriend. 'Some people call it a pre-engagement. It's all about timing – at the moment we're both so busy with work. Pre-engaged: Camilla was joined by her England rugby captain boyfriend Chris Robshaw but her dress was the focus of attention. 'I even had to spend Valentine's Day outside in the cold sandwiched between hordes of angry men as I cheered Chris on during his game.' 'Pre-engagement' is a growing trend, with thousands of couples now choosing 'promise' rings ahead of a formal proposal. Camilla, though, has her eye on the real thing, and has been spotted scouting engagement rocks at Tiffany. Racy: Camilla flashed more than hint of sideboob in her dramatically racy floor-length gown. One way to get attention: Kerslake's dress made sure she stood out on the star-studded red carpet. So far, her  6ft 2in boyfriend has been notably reticent when friends have quizzed him on the subject. But Camilla appears undeterred. 'It's tricky now as I'm currently locked away in the studio recording my third album and Chris is obviously incredibly busy and focused on his rugby and the Six Nations. 'But he gets back from England camp in April and the Six Nations boys have some time off in May and weekends off in June, so we'll have more time to ourselves then,' she added. 'As soon as things calm down for both of us work-wise, we'll start making plans.' Tight game: Robshaw (not pictured) played for his club Harlequins against Gloucester on Saturday. Loved up: The happy couple cosied up to each other as they arrived for the awards in London on Sunday. Meanwhile, Memphis: The Musical and Carole King show Beautiful lead the race for Britain's equivalent of Broadway's Tonys, with a clutch of nominations each, including best new musical. Memphis, set in the segregated 1950s American South, has nine nominations, including best actress in a musical for soul-singer star Beverley Knight. Beautiful has eight, with Katie Brayben a contender for her performance as chart-topping songwriter King. The other nominees for best new musical are Sunny Afternoon, the story of The Kinks, and Imelda Marcos-inspired Here Lies Love, created by David Byrne and Fatboy Slim. Inseparable: The classical singer met Chris when she performed at a charity dinner in 2011. Leaving little to the imagination: The dress showed off every inch of the blonde singer's body. Best-actress nominees are Gillian Anderson for A Streetcar Named Desire, Kristin Scott Thomas for Electra, Imelda Staunton for Good People and Penelope Wilton for Taken at Midnight. Best actor contenders are James McAvoy for The Ruling Class, Tim Pigott-Smith for King Charles III, Mark Strong for A View from the Bridge and Richard Armitage for The Crucible. Former X Factor judge Nicole Scherzinger is guaranteed an ovation when she takes to the stage at tonight's Olivier Awards, but could be going home with a gong as well after she was nominated for her role in the revival of Cats. The singer will share the bill with names including Talking Heads frontman David Byrne, Downton Abbey's Laura Carmichael, Dame Judi Dench, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Pixie Lott and Russell Tovey. A beauty: She styled her blonde hair to one side, while wearing dramatic red lipstick and taupe eyewear to give the look a perfect flourish. Scherzinger, nominated for best supporting actress in a musical for her role as Grizabella in Cats, will perform Memory from the hit show. There will be huge cheers if there is a win for 89-year-old Angela Lansbury, up for best supporting actress for playing scatterbrained psychic Madame Arcati in Blithe Spirit. Other nominees include Gemma Arterton who is up for best actress in a musical for her Made In Dagenham performance - her first onstage singing role - as factory worker Rita O'Grady. She is pitted against Tamsin Greig (Women On The Verge Of A Nervous Breakdown), Beverley Knight (Memphis The Musical) and Katie Brayben (Beautiful - The Carole King Musical). New productions Memphis The Musical and Beautiful - The Carole King Musical lead the nominations for individual productions, with nine and eight nods respectively. Pose for cameras: She happily perfected her red pout as she made her way down the red carpet. Beaming: The gorgeous couple looked to be in great spirits as they arrived together at the star-studded event.

Inside Manchester City, the Chilean has always provided a welcome contrast to the emotional stresses of life epitomised by his predecessor Roberto Mancini but — on the field and across the landscape of English football — Pellegrini has made the shallowest of footprints. Progress at the Etihad Stadium has in recent years been slight. Indeed, you could say there has been none, particularly in relation to money spent. At City, however, the fact is that the identity of the manager represents only a small part of the problem. Manuel Pellegrini could be out of a job in the summer, and if he is, he will have left little behind. Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany has fallen well short of the standards he set in recent seasons. Pellegrini leaves the stadium as Manchester City suffered their fifth defeat in seven matches. As reported in Sportsmail after City’s defeat in Barcelona last month, there is no particular desire at the club to sack Pellegrini. More poor results, more points separating his team from champions-elect Chelsea may cause the ground to shift a little further but any decision regarding the manager will be motivated much more by what happens next rather than what happened over the past eight months. Certainly, this has been a lamentable defence of the title, as bad as when conceding it by 11 points in 2013. At the Etihad there is, however, a recognition that problems are not all down to the manager. There are some issues with Pellegrini. Some City players think he is too nice — a soft touch who does not inspire with words or his substitutions and who displays a fondness for a 4-4-2 formation that they feel leaves them vulnerable. Pellegrini has not alienated or even polarised his dressing room, however. The majority are happy to work and play for him. The more significant problem is that City’s squad, constructed carefully and expensively, is too old, too foreign and has not been improved by recent transfers. James Milner is one of very few Englishmen in a first team squad that is too foreign and too old. Manchester City signed defender Eliaquim Mangala for £32million last summer and he has been poor. Wilfried Bony was signed in January from Swansea for £28m but has only scored once since arriving. City have had a very good team for quite a while now. Signing David Silva and Yaya Toure in 2010 and Sergio Aguero a year later lifted them to their current level but nothing since the first Premier League title has hinted at the further progress many presumed would be inevitable. Recruitment has, on the whole, been poor, thus allowing established players to coast, perhaps subconsciously, without the pressure of in-house competition. Football director Txiki Begiristain has been largely responsible for this and his contribution, at least that which we can see, has been disappointing given the reputation earned at Barcelona. At all clubs, teams and players must move forward to thrive but too many at City have stagnated. Vincent Kompany, for example, no longer seems capable of looking after his own performances, never mind that of his team. For a club captain, his popularity in the City dressing room is limited. Elsewhere, players such as Samir Nasri contributed when City were playing well but disappeared once things became harder. Since hacking at Neymar during the Barcelona defeat, an act that earned him the cheapest of yellow cards, the France international has played only 13 minutes of two games. It is understood that the two things are not unrelated. Nasri is just one who may fret a little about his future this summer. Txiki Begiristain (left) has failed to live up to his reputation, and Manchester City's recruitment has been poor. Stevan Jovetic, a £22m signing from Fiorentina, could find himself shipped out as City try to deal with FFP. Samir Nasri gives a thumbs up despite City's defeat at Crystal Palace, and the Frenchman's poor form. Wary of Financial Fair Play restrictions, City cannot spend enormous sums on targets such as Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba without first selling. Others who are vulnerable include Stevan Jovetic, Bacary Sagna and even Toure. The Toure debate is not new but what should be kept in mind is that the Ivorian will not be going anywhere until someone matches a salary that exceeds £1million a month. It could be that City’s climb back to the very top will be slow. They will need to be shrewder in the market and hope investment in their academy pays off. Better decisions are required from top to bottom. As for Pellegrini, he would be daft to think he is not vulnerable and a late-season surge would help him. Odd as it sounds, however, the identity of the manager is currently not City’s biggest issue.

Manchester City have made little progress since Manuel Pellegrini arrived. Despite last year's title win, City have again failed miserably to retain it. Vincent Kompany no longer capable of producing top performances. City’s squad, constructed carefully and expensively, is too old, too foreign.

Article: Martin Tyler has been in the commentary game for 40 years, so it's safe to say he's witnessed his fair share of blockbusters. Confessing himself as a 'chief witness' of football it's no surprise, then, that when asked to pick a favourite he is able to pluck one game in particular from his encyclopaedic memory. 'I've been very lucky to cover so many great games but I do usually plump for this same one,' Tyler reminisced with Sky Sports. 'Liverpool 4, Newcastle 3.' Stan Collymore (third left) smashes home Liverpool's fourth past Newcastle goalkeeper Pavel Srnicek. He is of course referring to the seven goal thriller at Anfield on April, 1996, which saw the two Premier League hopefuls slug it out in order to close the gap between themselves and leaders Manchester United. 'Everybody remembers Newcastle going for [the league title] but Liverpool were in the mix as well; and maybe they looked too much at each other because neither of them won it in the end.' Despite Sir Alex Ferguson's Manchester United finishing top of the pile at the end of the season, the game still firmly holds a place in Tyler's personal archive. Robbie Fowler (second right) rises above John Beresford to head home the opener for Liverpool. Fowler's early goal began the seven goal spectacle that Martin Tyler classed as his favourite game. David Ginola (right) keeps calm under the pressure of Jason McAteer to slot home Newcastle's second. Les Ferdinand (left) scored the Magpies' first goal and congratulates Ginola after putting them ahead. 'I think if you take all the elements of why we all love football they all happened in this particular game.' With Liverpool's potent striker Robbie Fowler breaking the deadlock on the bobbly Anfield pitch after just two minutes, the outlook looked bleak for Newcastle that evening. However, when Magpies striker Les Ferdinand levelled on ten minutes it began a ferocious exchange between the two sides that few could forget. Strikes from Newcastle's David Ginola and Faustino Asprilla either side of another from Fowler continued the goalfest and when Liverpool's Stan Collymore drew both sides level with just over 20 minutes remaining the game was balanced on a knife edge. Faustino Asprilla (left) salutes the crowd after scoring Newcastle's third in the classic match at Anfield. Stan Collymore (second right) is mobbed by his team-mates after all but sealing the win for the home side. Collymore celebrates the win after scoring twice against Newcastle on that memorable afternoon. In the dying embers of the match, Collymore latched on to a ball from John Barnes two minutes into injury time to score the seventh goal of the game; and Tyler still remembers the moment the Kop went wild. 'I get goosebumps every time I hear it because it was such a special time. 'Poor Kevin Keegan slumped over the advertising hoardings at the end is one of the iconic shots of the game, perhaps the iconic shot. 'Whatever makes us so addicted to football it was the drug.'

Martin Tyler revealed 1996 Anfield thriller is his favourite game of all time. The iconic commentator says the winning goal still gives him goosebumps. Liverpool opened the scoring on two minutes through Robbie Fowler. Newcastle equalised eight minutes later after Les Ferdinand's strike. What followed was a seven goal thriller that went right to the wire. It was a chance for both teams to put pressure on league leaders Manchester United.

Article: (CNN)It's the kind of thing you see in movies, like Robert Redford's role in "All Is Lost" or Ang Lee's "Life of Pi." But, in real life, it's hard to swallow the idea of a single person being stranded at sea for days, weeks, if not months and somehow living to talk about it. Miracles do happen, though, and not just in Hollywood. We're not talking about people who float aimlessly or run aground after running out of gas or being let down by faltering winds only to be picked up a few hours later by the U.S. Coast Guard. Much rarer are cases in which individuals become lost at sea long enough that they run out of whatever food and drinking water they'd brought aboard, if any. In order to survive, they can't bank on technology or the proximity of a nearby city, town or boat -- but instead must rely on ingenuity, resourcefulness and luck. It's hard to say how many of these types of stories end sadly, with a sailor dying at sea, except that it is a much higher number than those that end in rescues. Such happy endings do occur -- given what rescue agencies have reported and assuming you believe what any sole survivor says, a big qualifier since typically no one else can prove or refute their accounts. Below are a few recent examples:. Louis Jordan says that he set off on his 35-foot sailboat from South Carolina in late January. He headed into the Gulf Stream looking for a good spot to catch fish. And then everything -- his boat, his life -- turned upside down. Rescued man says he is 'utterly thankful' Not only did his boat capsize, but its mast broke, Jordan said. And so, too, did his shoulder. He bought time by rationing water, then collecting fresh water in a bucket. As to food, Jordan says he used laundry to trap and scoop up fish. And he rigged a makeshift mast and sail. But, Jordan said, "It took so long. It moved so slowly." His sailboat would capsize two more times before crew members on a German-flagged container ship, the Houston Express, spotted Jordan about 200 miles off the North Carolina coast on Thursday. After their reunion, his father greeted him with a hug and an admission every parent dreads. "I thought I lost you." Jose Salvador Alvarenga says his journey began in Paredon Viejo, a port on Mexico's Pacific coast, in late 2012. The exact date is up for debate -- he says he set off in December, locals say it was November. But what's not in doubt is that, after he left, he disappeared. Until January 2013. That's when Alvarenga interacted with humans once again, thousands of miles away on a remote atoll in the Marshall Islands. Castaway recounts how he survived over a year adrift in Pacific. What was supposed to be a one-day trip, he says, turned into an arduous odyssey across the Pacific Ocean, one that saw him lose his fishing companion and tested his will and ability to survive. His nightmare began when winds blew the pair off course. Then a storm hit causing their boat, which was about three people long and one wide, to lose its engine and use of its radio communication and GPS systems. Four weeks in, Alvarenga said his partner -- 23-year-old Ezequiel Cordova, according to the boat's owner -- died because he refused to eat raw birds. The days, weeks and months ran together after that. Alvarenga says he drank rainwater and, when there wasn't any available, his own urine. He ate sea turtles. Then, after 13 or 14 months adrift, he and his small, heavily damaged boat arrived on the Ebon Atoll, about a 22-hour boat ride from the Marshall Islands capital of Majuro. The atoll has one phone line, no Internet service and a few residents, two of whom Alvarenga spotted and shouted to after spending a night in the woods. The El Salvador native told CNN that his faith in God helped him survive. "I thought, 'I am going to get out," he said. "Get out, get out, get out." Some in their late 60s might relax in their retirement, reining it in a few notches as life slows down. And if you live in Hawaii, there's even more reason to take it easy. The thing is: Ron Ingraham isn't one of those people. He's a fisherman. The sea is both his life and livelihood, his son, Zakary, told CNN. And he's tough, with his son jokingly comparing him to Rambo. Still, even the hardiest fishermen would have been tested by what Ron Ingraham went through after setting off around last Thanksgiving solo from the Hawaiian island of Molokai. Son vindicated as father rescued after 12 days at sea. After bad weather hit, Ron Ingraham told CNN affiliate KHNL/KGMB that his 25-foot sailboat went "backwards all night long." At one point, a huge wave struck -- pushing his mast into the water and him as well. The 67-year-old used a rope to pull himself back in. But his boat couldn't be rescued so easily, leaving him at the mercy of the current. A distress call went out, prompting a search that would cover 12,000 square miles. When a Coast Guard official told him the search was being called off December 1, Zakary Ingraham responded, "I don't feel like he's dead. I don't feel it." He was right. Twelve days after that first distress call, Ron Ingraham was picked up about 64 miles (103 kilometers) south of Honolulu "weak, hungry and dehydrated" and -- most importantly -- alive. The veteran fisherman headed back to shore only after getting assurances his damaged boat would come with him. In February 2012, two friends asked 18-year-old Adrian Vasquez whether he wanted to tag along on an overnight fishing expedition. He said yes, and the three set off from the Panama town of San Carlos on a small boat, Vasquez's mother, Nilsa de la Cruz, recalled. Things started out well, by all accounts. The three caught plenty of fish. Then, their boat's engine died without warning. And, with no tools and scant navigational experience, the trio didn't know what to do, according to Vasquez's mother. Mother calls Panama teen's return 'a miracle' Vazquez ate raw fish and drank rainwater as currents swept his boat, the Fifty Cents, further and further from the coast and into the Pacific Ocean. Somewhere along the way, his two companions died. It's not clear exactly how, with Ecuadorian Rear. Adm. Freddy Garcia Calle saying Vasquez threw their bodies into the sea "because they had become badly decomposed." Some 26 days after and nearly 600 miles away from where the journey began, fishermen spotted the tiny vessel north of the Galapagos Islands. The Ecuadorian navy came in and picked up the teenage survivor, who'd lost 20 pounds and showed "severe signs of dehydration and lack of nutrition," according to Calle. He returned home to loved ones eager to embrace him, but mindful of giving him time to process the ordeal. "For us, this is an opportunity to get closer as a family," his mother said by phone, "to be more understanding and loving." Sometimes one doesn't have to be in the ocean for weeks to have his or her life imperiled. Sometimes people don't have to set off by boat to have the sea challenge them to the end. For proof, look no further than Hiromitsu Shinkawa. 60-year-old man waves red flag to alert rescuers. He was at home on March 11, 2011, when a massive 9.0 magnitude earthquake struck 231 miles northeast of Tokyo. A devastating tsunami followed, its 30-foot waves ravaging cities and towns and damaging several nuclear reactors. By the time it had run the course, nearly 16,000 people were dead. It's a miracle Shinkawa wasn't one of them. Shortly after the quake, he and his wife had gone to collect some belongings when the tsunami slammed their hometown of Minamisoma. His home was one of the tens of thousands destroyed by the the huge, powerful tsunami wave. "I was saved by holding onto the roof," the 60-year-old said, according to Kyodo News Agency. "But my wife was swept away.' More than two days later, video showed Shinkawa barely visible amid heaps of splintered wood, shattered homes and other debris floating more than nine miles (15 kilometers) out to sea. He was waving a self-made red flag. After being spotted by crew aboard a Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force destroyer and picked up in a smaller rescue boat, he took a drink offered to him and burst into tears, Kyodo reported. Shinkawa told his rescuers, "I thought today was the last day of my life."

Article: Stuart McCall has sent a warning to Bilel Mohsni as he insisted Rangers will need cool heads for the promotion run-in. The Tunisian centre-back extended his questionable disciplinary record by picking up a booking for reacting to opposition fans during Thursday’s 3-0 defeat from Queen of the South. McCall believes Mohsni has good defensive attributes but is adamant the Ibrox side cannot risk unnecessary suspensions as they attempt to land a Premiership place via the play-offs. Stuart McCall calls time on training ahead of Rangers match with Raith on Sunday. The Rangers boss has spoken to Tunisian defender Bilel Mohsni (2nd left) about his discipline. ‘I’ve had to have a word with him over his concentration levels,’ said McCall. ‘He did some absolutely outstanding things in the game and then he did some slack and sloppy things. ‘I didn’t know what he was booked for and Kenny (Black) had said it was a reaction to their fans. He was probably frustrated and angry at the result. ‘But I’ll have another look at it as we can’t afford to have silly bookings at this point in the season. Ian Black got one the other day and there are a couple of other lads a game away from being suspended. ‘If it’s for tackles you can maybe understand it but we can’t afford cheap bookings for running to the crowd, taking your shirt off, back chat with referees, kicking the ball away – I don’t like things like that. It’s a lack of discipline.’ Rangers players look dejected as defeat to Queen of the South dents their bid for promotion. Rangers will attempt to bounce back from the first loss of McCall’s tenure when they host Raith on Sunday. They currently sit behind second-placed Hibs on goal difference but have a game in hand. ‘There will be a lot of big games, big crowds, tension and drama until the last kick of the season,’ added McCall ‘So cool heads is the way to go. But I still like fire in the belly. I don’t want people to surrender meekly and mildly. Nothing wrong with a bit of passion as long as it’s channelled in the right way.’ McCall insisted the Palmerston reverse shouldn’t be viewed as a ‘disaster’ and feels he already has evidence of his side’s ability to recover from disappointments. ‘We just have to draw a line under it. I don’t want doom and gloom. We drew the first two games when I came here. That wasn’t what we wanted, so we bounced back from those. We then went on a decent run and now we’ve had another setback. It’s about how we react.’

Article: Tottenham target Kevin Wimmer will move to England this summer, according to Austria manager Marcel Koller. The Cologne defender, who is wanted by Spurs in a £4.4million deal, has impressed the boss of his national team as well as scouts at White Hart Lane this season. Earlier this week Wimmer confirmed that the two clubs were yet to agree a fee but that now appears to have changed after comments from Koller. Cologne's 22-year-old Austria international defender Kevin Wimmer is a £4.4 million target for Tottenham. He says it would be a 'dream' to join a top club like Spurs and would relish the challenge of English football. He said: 'He has played exactly the same as I've seen him do already in Cologne. On the ball he is very calm, not rushed. 'He switches in the summer to England. With his young age he still has potential to improve. He has it all.' Wimmer has admitted that it would be a 'dream' to join Mauricio Pochettino's side this summer. He told Laola TV: 'The two clubs have yet to agree because of the transfer fee. They are still negotiating. Wimmer, who has one senior international cap for Austria, would help Spurs bolster their defensive options. 'It would be a dream to move to a top club like Tottenham. For me, the transfer is a big step, a step with which I can develop myself. That's why I want to take the chance. 'I'm not someone who wants to stop developing. That is why England would be the next step. I'm playing in Germany. This is pretty much the best league in the world. 'The English Premier League is the only one that can match that. For me, the English league would be a great challenge. There I can develop because it's very demanding. I'm a fan of English football.'

Article: (CNN)The world's biggest and most powerful physics experiment is taking place as you read this. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a particle accelerator and the largest machine in the world, is ready for action following a two-year shutdown. After problems that delayed the restart in March, scientists at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) completed final tests, enabling the first beams to start circulating Sunday inside the LHC's 17 mile (27 km) ring. "Operating accelerators for the benefit of the physics community is what CERN's here for," CERN Director-General Rolf Heuer said on the organization's website. "Today, CERN's heart beats once more to the rhythm of the LHC." The LHC generates up to 600 million particles per second, with a beam circulating for 10 hours, traveling more than 6 billion miles (more than 10 billion kilometers) -- the distance from Earth to Neptune and back again. At near light-speed, a proton in the LHC makes 11,245 circuits per second. It took thousands of scientists, engineers and technicians decades to devise and build the particle accelerator, housed in a tunnel between Lake Geneva and the Jura mountain range. The purpose of the lengthy project is to recreate the conditions that existed moments after the "Big Bang" -- the scientific theory said to explain the creation of the universe. By replicating the energy density and temperature, scientists hope to uncover how the universe evolved. Our current, limited, knowledge is based on what's called The Standard Model of particle physics.  "But we know that this model is not complete," Dr. Mike Lamont, operations group leader at the LHC, told CNN in March. The burning questions that remain include the origin of mass and why some particles are very heavy, while others have no mass at all; a unified description of all the fundamental forces such as gravity; and uncovering dark matter and dark energy, since visible matter accounts for only 4 percent of the universe. The LHC could also question the idea that the universe is only made of matter, despite the theory that antimatter must have been produced in the same amounts at the time of the Big Bang. CERN says the energies achievable by the LHC have only ever been found in nature. The machine alone costs approximately three billion euros (about $3.3 billion), paid for by member countries of CERN and contributions by non-member nations. The organization also asserts that its guidelines for the protection of the environment and personnel comply with standards set by Swiss and French laws and a European Council Directive. Scientists and physics enthusiasts will be waiting with bated breath as the LHC ventures into the great unknown. "After two years of effort, the LHC is in great shape," said CERN Director for Accelerators and Technology, Frédérick Bordry. "But the most important step is still to come when we increase the energy of the beams to new record levels." Peter Shadbolt contributed to this report.

Article: Veteran Leeds prop Kylie Leuluai is facing the prospect of another six weeks on the sidelines after being told he needs shoulder surgery. The 37-year-old New Zealander has not played since the Super League leaders' only defeat at Warrington a month ago but coach Brian McDermott says his injury has now been properly diagnosed. 'We thought his biceps were the problem but he's actually got a bit of floating tissue in his shoulder which he's going to have cleaned out,' McDermott said. Kylie Leuluai faces another six weeks out of action for the Leeds Rhinos after being told he needs surgery. 'He will be out for anything from between four to six weeks.' McDermott had feared Leuluai could be out for three months if he needed a bicep operation. 'It's great news,' McDermott added. 'He has still got an important role to play with us. 'I think we've missed him over Easter, not just the extra body, but some of the direct carries he gives you.'

Article: Boss Tim Sherwood backed Christian Benteke to fire Aston Villa to safety after the striker's crucial hat-trick saved a point against QPR. The forward's treble - his first in two years - clinched a pulsating 3-3 draw with their drop rivals as Villa edged further clear of the bottom three. Villa are three points above the Barclays Premier League drop zone and denied QPR the chance to leapfrog them in the table. Christian Benteke scored a stunning hat-trick as Aston Villa drew 3-3 against Queens Park Rangers. Manager Tim Sherwood said that Benteke can fire Villa to Premier League safety. Defeat would have left Villa in the relegation zone and behind QPR but Benteke struck a 25-yard free-kick with seven minutes left to save them and complete his treble. The Belgium international has seven goals in seven games under Sherwood and the boss hopes he can maintain his form to keep Villa up. He said: 'That's the plan. 'It doesn't come much better than that. He's a good player, I have always said it and he's in a rich vein of form. 'It's fantastic for him to score the goals, it's just a shame we couldn't get the three points. 'It's not about what you deserve, it's about what you get and we got one point. 'This could be a vital point come the end of the season in the end, when you go so late into the game and Christian has had to pull that out the bag we're grateful.' But Sherwood insisted Villa should have won after Benteke's first-half double, cancelling out Matt Phillips' opener, gave them a 2-1 lead at the break. He said: 'It's disappointing when you dominate a football match like that, the ref should have stopped it at half-time. QPR were only ahead for three minutes in the first half after Benteke equalised for the hosts at Villa Park. Benteke drove beyond Rob Green from the edge of the box to net his seventh goal of the season early on. 'I thought we tired in the second half but that's to be expected and two of those back four have trained about four times in eight weeks. We dropped off a little bit too deep and couldn't keep that pressure on them. 'But anyone who has seen that football match knows it shouldn't have been close.' Rangers hit back after the break through Clint Hill and Charlie Austin, the latter netting with just 12 minutes left. They have taken four points from their last two away games after winning just once on the road this season before Saturday's 4-1 win at West Brom. The draw, though, left them two points from safety having played a game more and boss Chris Ramsey admitted he was nervous after Austin's goal. He said: 'It's a long time, it's heart attack time for managers that. You can see you're going to win but you know there's a chance anything can happen, a free-kick, a corner or a bit of magic. Benteke's added two more, including this wonder free-kick - much like Jason Puncheon's on Monday night. 'I thought we could (hang on) but a free-kick is a free-kick, at that stage most of their attacking options had been exhausted. 'I'm disappointed if I'm being honest. But before the game if someone said we'd get four points from the last two games we probably would have taken that.' Rangers were seeking back-to-back away wins in the top flight for the first time since 1995 but Ramsey targeted home victories to keep them up. They host Chelsea on Sunday before welcoming West Ham and Newcastle to Loftus Road. He said: 'I don't know what we need but we're probably going to have to win three games. I don't know what the points total will be but our two home games are going to be very important after Chelsea. 'We have got a couple of very difficult ones in Liverpool and Manchester City and then we have the potential cup final against Leicester on the last day of the season. 'Most teams would take being in it right to the end and then roll the dice, you don't want to start being detached because it's a big mountain to climb.'

Christian Benteke netted all three as Aston Villa drew 3-3 against QPR. The Belgian can fire Aston Villa to Premier League safety. That's the view of Tim Sherwood, who lauded his main striker.

Article: Has this brilliant 79th Masters got one final twist to reveal come the final round on Sunday? No-one would be surprised following the dramatic events of the third round, when the three biggest names in the sport combined with Justin Rose to throw the veritable kitchen sink at the cool 21 year old Texan Jordan Spieth. The young American coped so adeptly he gave up just one shot of his five stroke halfway lead and will partner Rose in the final round armed with a useful advantage. But there was just enough vulnerability shown in his finish to offer encouragement not only to Rose but Masters specialist Phil Mickelson, who will start five behind. Spieth is the third player his age to take a healthy lead into the final round. It worked out perfectly for Tiger Woods in 1997 but not so well for Rory McIlroy in 2011, who collapsed under the pressure over the final nine holes. ‘I think Jordan will cope better than I did because he was in the final group last year,’ said McIlroy. ‘I certainly expect him to cope a lot better than I did.’ Jordan Spieth carded a double bogey on the 17th but still set a new 54-hole scoring record at the Masters. At 16 under par, Spieth broke the record shared by Ray Floyd and Tiger Woods by a single shot. The other thing Spieth has in his favour is that this is the fourth tournament in a row when he has been in the final group in the final round. He won one and finished runner-up in the other two. If he wins, he will go to number two in the world and the rivalry with Rory that might dominate golf for the next decade will have begun. Spieth looked to have taken the tournament beyond everyone else when he went seven strokes clear with just two holes to play. But while Rose finished off with a staggering fifth birdie in his last six holes, Spieth was running up his first double bogey of the tournament at the 17th. And at the last there was a horrible fanned approach that threatened to trim the lead to just three, before Spieth conjured up a remarkable up and down to give him momentum heading into what promises to be another momentous Masters Sunday. Plucky journeyman Charley Hoffman lies fourth while Woods and McIlroy both shot 68 to be tied fifth and will play together on Sunday. But at ten shots off the pace they are surely too far behind. As for Rose, the 2013 US Open champion has given himself the chance of seizing another major following his astonishing finish. Pick of the quintet of birdies came at the par three 16th, where he holed a spectacular bunker shot. ‘I think it’s important to be in the final group, it’s where you want to be,’ said the 34 year old Englishman. ‘Jordan is obviously playing some very special golf but I have definitely given myself an opportunity.’ World No 1 Rory McIlroy and 14-time major winner Tiger Woods were in a five-way tie for fifth. Finally, the real McIlroy showed upon the par fives at Augusta on Saturday. What a day we had on Saturday. It was as if Rose and the big three in terms of charisma had come up with an unspoken pact and declared: ‘Ok, let’s see if this kid Jordan is really destined for greatness.’ For those who thought the runaway halfway leader had merely to turn up to claim the green jacket, we had McIlroy playing like the world number one and Tiger confounding the sceptics with a bravura display that made you feel the last 12 months had all been a bad dream. There was the glorious sight of Mickelson playing once more like he owns Augusta. And then there was Rose, who has had a lot of good days at Augusta in his ten Masters tournaments and now was enjoying one more. How would you like to see all that taking place in your rear view mirror, at this of all courses? In short, for five simply incredible hours the roars were echoing all over this sacred property and for most of that time they were funnelling in Spieth’s direction. This was undoubtedly as severe an examination as you could imagine for a third round. Just as well, then, that the creed that has served him so well already during his phenomenal 18 months as a professional just happens to be: ’Whenever the heat is on, ensure you focus just that little bit more.’ And that, for the most part, is just what he did. Only at the end did he look like stumbling, but that fabulous up and down at the last kept everything upbeat. Tiger Woods put on a vintage show, he was astonishing, electric, inspired and charismatic. Woods' girlfriend Lindsey Vonn showed her support during the third round on Saturday. The previous 54 hole standard of 15 under was set by Ray Floyd in 1976 and Woods in 1997. But the youngest first round leader in Masters history and the man who set a new low mark for 36 holes on Friday had reached 16 under after a 70. What made this so impressive was that, for the first time, a few errors crept into his previously immaculate game. During the round he would have three three putts and his first double. When things like this happen here it’s so easy for the mind to unravel but Spieth kept his composure. At the par five second that peerless putting stroke rapped home another birdie putt and one more at the sixth. At the treacherous 9th he seemed to have left himself a difficult second shot, from a downhill lie to an elevated green. Spieth knocked his approach to 6ft and holed that one as well to turn in 35 shots. In its own way, this was the equal of his spectacular bouts of scoring in the first two rounds. So it continued. The two stringent par fours to start the back nine were safely negotiated before his tee shot to the par three 12th came down 8ft from the flag. You can guess what happened next, and he birdied the 13th as well. He would threeputt the 14th, however – and then came the next test. Phil Mickelson played like the Masters specialist to finish the third round on 11 under. Justin Rose reeled off five birdies in the last six holes to move into second place on 12 under. As he made his way down the 15th fairway, first Mickelson and then Rose made amazing birdies at the 16th to send the crowd into raptures. How would he respond? Well, at the 15th he calmly stroked a four iron into the middle of the green for a two putt birdie. Best of all was the eight iron he struck to 8ft at the 16th for yet another birdie. McIlroy, Woods and Mickelson all shot sumptuous front nines of 32 shots. Mickelson was wearing a salmon pink shirt in honour of Arnold Palmer. Some of his great attacking play had been delivered wearing just such a colour and Mickelson was doing justice to the memory. Eight strokes off the pace at the start of play, he’s still in the ball game but will need another magic-filled round today. Add McIlroy’s wonderful back nine 31 from Friday afternoon to his front nine 32 yesterday, and you would have a round that equalled the course record of 63. Amazing how the switch flipped for him at the halfway point in the second round. So tentative to that point and perhaps a touch nervous with all that was at stake, it was as if he looked at a leaderboard that showed him 17 shots off the lead and a stroke outside the projected halfway cut and decided: ‘To hell with it, let’s go for it.’ Finally, the real McIlroy showed up on the par fives, those scoring holes that have given him such problems in recent years. An eagle at the 13th on Friday was followed by an eagle on the second in his third round. He was off and running. He birdied the long 8th plus the 13th and 15th for his best-ever return on the par fives during a single round at the Masters. A poor eight iron to the 16th cost him, however, as a 6ft par putt was dribbled miserably. Another bogey at the last as well meant a 68. And so the likely list of winners stands at just three – Spieth, Rose and Mickelson. It should be some final day. It has been some tournament.

Jordan Spieth set a Masters record 54-hole total of 16-under-par. The American carding a 70 to take a four-shot lead into the final round. Justin Rose collected five birdies on his final six holes to go 12 under. Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods were among those at six under after 68s.

Article: Atlanta (CNN)It was a scene worthy of any top cop show on TV -- bullets flying, banged-up cars and the FBI chasing an armed robbery suspect. In the end, two agents were injured in a crash and the suspect was shot before being captured. FBI agents and task force officers were following 36-year-old Kevone Charleston of Austell, Georgia, as he pulled into a CVS pharmacy in Forsyth County, Georgia, early Saturday. Charleston is suspected of involvement in 32 commercial robberies dating to November 2013, according to FBI officials. "The incident all happened around 7 o'clock Saturday morning," said FBI Special Agent Stephen Emmett. "There were multiple agents and officers that were following him based on his prior MO, and when they saw he was about to rob another CVS, they moved in." Authorities say Charleston parked his vehicle nearby and then popped the hood as if there were something wrong. Then he walked to the CVS, preparing to enter. When agents confronted him, Charleston ran, got in his car and traveled about 75 yards as agents opened fire. "There were several FBI vehicles that were rammed or were hit by the suspect's vehicle when he was trying to flee. One government vehicle sustained heavy damage to its front and side, and another government SUV ended up on its side. That's how the two agents sustained their injuries," Emmett said. Twelve FBI agents and six government vehicles followed Charleston. Emmett said Charleston "was trying to get away, our agents were trying to stop him. He collided with the first government vehicle, the Taurus, then the second, and the SUV ended on its side. "The perp was stopped 8 feet away in the median, and that's where he received his gunshot wounds." The two agents were treated at an area hospital and released, according to Emmett, who says "they are fine." Charleston was shot and wounded by FBI agents and task force officers, but his injuries are not life threatening, according to Forsyth County Sheriff's Deputy Robin Regan. Although he declined to give details of the 32 previous robberies, Emmett said it was an intensive investigation that was already underway as a priority for the FBI's violent crimes and major offender squad. He added, "His MO involved armed confrontations, so our officers went into this fully prepared for an armed confrontation based on his past history." Emmett says he's relieved that the FBI's officers and agents are OK and that the suspect is in custody. He said it was the "conclusion of an intensive and lengthy investigation." CNN's Vivian Kuo and Ryan Scallan contributed to this report.

Article: A litter of adorable baby foxes are being looked after they were discovered abandoned in a cardboard box in a car park in Pennsylvania. The newborn cubs were discovered by a woman passing the car park, who noticed the box sitting next to a clothing donation bin. When she peeped inside she saw seven baby foxes – thought to be only 10 days old – sitting together. Scroll down for video. The baby foxes are being looked after after they were discovered in a cardboard box, left by a clothing donation bin in a car park. The seven cubs weighed around six ounces each when they were taken in by the Pocono Wildlife Rehabilitation and Educational Center. Three of the rescued red foxes rest with a cuddly toy. Once they have grown and gained strength they will be released back into the wild. The cubs were taken to the Pocono Wildlife Rehabilitation and Educational Center in Stroudsbury, where they are now being cared for. Katherine Uhler, director of the center, said the little creatures -  five males and two females - were healthy but dehydrated when they arrived. She said: ‘They came in at about six ounces each. ‘There are five males, also known as dogs, and two girls known as vixens. ‘We know they're red foxes because even though they're not red yet, they still have this little white tail.’ The center is spending more than $1,000 looking after the foxes, who are being bottle-fed special 'fox milk' and formula. Ms Uhler added: ‘We had to give them rabies vaccinations and feed them fox milk. 'We gave them Pedialyte fluids first then mixed a quart of Fox Valley formula which is designed specifically for baby wild foxes. Vets at the center said they know the cubs are red foxes - among the most common of the species in America - because of their white tales. ‘We bottle feed them until they are a little bigger, then they'll start feeding out of the bowl. ‘When they're finished feeding out of the bowl then we'll start feeding them what they eat in the wild which is meat, and some vegetables and fruits.’ The pack will be returned back to the wild in July. It is costing the center in Pennsylvania more than $1,000 to take care of the group, which includes  five male and two female red foxes. The tiny animals were vaccinated against rabies and have been bottle-fed milk to build them up, before they will start feeding from a bowl.

Article: Chelsea will try to add another trophy to their ever-expanding cabinet when the Under 19 team take on Shakhtar Donetsk in the final of the UEFA Youth League on Monday afternoon. Adi Viveash's team will start as favourites in Nyon, Switzerland after their resounding 4-0 win over Roma in the semi-finals on Friday, a result which continued their free-scoring form in this competition. Ahead of the final, we bring you everything you need to know. Chelsea striker Dominic Solanke starred in his side's emphatic 4-0 semi-final win over Roma on Friday. Solanke has scored 11 UEFA Youth League games during Chelsea's route to the final in Nyon, Switzerland. REMIND ME, WHAT IS THE UEFA YOUTH LEAGUE? In a nutshell, it's the Champions League - but for Under 19 teams. In its second season, the Youth League was created by UEFA to enable up-and-coming players in Europe's leading academies to gain valuable experience of playing in continental competition. The group phase runs in parallel with its big brother, with the same 32 teams as in the Champions League matched in the same groups. The main difference is that the knockout rounds are single-legged and the semi-finals and final in the same place over the course of one weekend. SO, WHERE IS THAT? Monday's final will be played at the Stade Colovray, which is situated in the shadow of UEFA's headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland. It's a pleasant spot, overlooking Lake Geneva, and is the home of Stade Nyonnais, who play in the Swiss third tier. It's capacity is 7,200 and pretty big crowds were there enjoying the sunshine and the football in Friday's semi-finals. WHEN IS THE GAME AND CAN I WATCH IT? It will kick-off at 3pm UK time and the match is live on British Eurosport. WHO WON THE COMPETITION LAST YEAR? The maiden winners of the Youth League were Barcelona, who defeated Benfica 3-0 in a one-sided final. The goals came from Rodrigo and a double from Munir El Haddadi, the competition's top goalscorer with 11 and now a member of the first-team squad. There was no English representation in the last four, though both Chelsea and Manchester City had made it to the quarter-finals. HOW HAVE THE BRITISH CLUBS DONE THIS YEAR? Chelsea, obviously, have made it all the way. Manchester City went out to Roma in the last eight, while both Arsenal and Liverpool tumbled out at the last 16 stage. Arsenal lost 1-0 to Atletico Madrid and Liverpool were beaten 2-1 by Benfica. ALL HOPES WITH CHELSEA THEN? Yes, and they will enter Monday's match as the marginal favourites. It is well-established that the Stamford Bridge academy is one of the best in England and last season saw the Under 21 team claim the Premier League title and the Under 18s win the FA Youth Cup. They will take on Manchester City in this season's Youth Cup final, too, over the next couple of weeks, their fifth final in six seasons. Having missed out on the NextGen Series title to Aston Villa two years ago, this is an excellent opportunity to assert their claim as one of Europe's best academies too. Chelsea's Isaiah Brown (left) tussle for the ball with Roma's Silvio Anocic (right) in the box. WHO HAVE THEY BEATEN TO GET THIS FAR? The Blues made a statement of intent in the group phase, winning five of their six matches and racking up 24 goals in the process. Slovenians Maribor were beaten 2-0 at home and 7-0 away, while Sporting Lisbon suffered 5-0 and 6-0 drubbings. Germans Schalke, who knocked Chelsea out last season, were beaten 4-1 before managing to win 2-0 at home. Chelsea then overcame Russians Zenit St Petersburg 3-1 in the last 16 courtesy of goals from Dominic Solanke, Kasey Palmer and Charlie Colkett. Atletico Madrid were then seen off 2-0 at Cobham in the quarters, with an own goal and another from Solanke securing their passage to Switzerland. But their most impressive performance came in the semi-final with Roma on Friday as a flurry of second-half goals from Colkett, Solanke (2) and Tammy Abraham left Roma in ruins. Chelsea's Ruben Loftus-Cheek (right) and Roma's Jose Machin (left) battle for the ball on Monday. WHAT ARE THEY SAYING? Coach Viveash was effusive about his team's qualities after their drubbing of Roma, telling Uefa.com: 'I'm very proud – proud of the players, proud of the staff who have worked very hard to get to this stage. When you see players perform like that it brings warmth to your heart. 'I feel very proud to work with that calibre of player and to watch them play is wonderful for everyone who works in our academy. They were excellent from minute one to minute 94 and thoroughly deserve their place in the final.' Tournament top scorer Solanke, who took his season's tally to 11 Youth League goals with a brace, added: 'I'm over the moon. We had quite a difficult journey yesterday because our flight was cancelled, so we had to get on with it today. It's amazing to reach the final. 'It's such a big tournament containing some of the best teams in the world. The level has gone up in the knockout games, but we've stepped things up as well and managed to reach the final.' WHO IS THE COACH? Adi Viveash is a former defender who played for Swindon Town, Walsall and Reading in the Football League during an 18-year playing career. He joined Chelsea's academy in 2008, starting with the Under 12 team and working his way up. In July 2011, he was appointed Under 18 coach and led the team to two FA Youth Cup triumphs in three seasons. Viveash stepped up to take charge of the under 21 team this season and doubles up to lead the under 19 side in the Youth League. MEET THE PLAYERS.

Article: A benefits cheat who claimed he could barely walk while starring for his pub football team has avoided jail. Raymond Billam illegally pocketed £15,000 of taxpayers' money after he said he was severely disabled due to back and knee problems. But fraud investigators secretly filmed the 40-year-old midfielder taking to the pitch for a Sunday League team after being tipped-off about his fraudulent claims. The grandfather-of-four admitted benefit fraud and was sentenced to 26-weeks in prison suspended for two years. Cheat: Raymond Billam, 40, claimed he was unable to walk more than a few metres, but was filmed running and jumping as he took to the pitch for his pub football team. Shaven headed Billam claimed he was unable to walk more than 20 metres without falling and needed crutches to get around. But between September 2008 and April 2014 he pulled on the green and black shirt of Ingsfield Lane football club and two other teams in the Mexborough and District Sunday League. In total Billam of Bolton-on-Dearne, South Yorkshire, played over 87 games while dishonestly claiming incapacity benefit, Barnsley Magistrates Court was told. Julie Grant, prosecuting, said: 'Over three consecutive Sundays he was playing football, running, jumping and participating fully showing no signs of discomfort.' His appearances and goals were even posted on the internet, magistrates' heard. 'Clearly this is not consistent with somebody unable to walk without aids,' the prosecutor added. When Billam was arrested he said he had 'good days and bad days' and he was so well-known in the league that others could have been playing under his name. But he could not provide investigators with a list of names. Billam admitted defrauding the Department of Work and Pensions by pocketing £15,066 through dishonestly failing to notify a change in circumstances which affected his disability living allowance. Chris Peace, defending, said Billam, who has four grandchildren, had worked as a contractor for Yorkshire Water for 16 years until he suffered a serious back injury in 2006 which needed surgery. He initially  made a legitimate claim and went from 13 to 18 and a half stones and had problems with drinking and gambling. 'He was in a bit of a state,' said Mr Peace. The court heard that playing football helped Billam recover from the the low point in his life. Billam had claimed more than £15,000 in incapacity benefit when the Department of Work and Pensions were tipped off. Unknown to the grandfather-of-four he was secretly filmed by fraud investigators donning his green and black shirt. Billam was sentenced to a 26-week suspended prison sentence after he admitted benefit fraud. Billam, who was taking jobs as a self employed plumber by October 2013, accepted that he should have notified the Department of Work and Pensions earlier that he was fit to work. 'The allowance was a regular source of income and he had three children at home and it was very difficult to do without that,' his lawyer said. 'It was difficult to wave goodbye to that when you have lots of bills.' The court heard Billam was repaying the money and the whole amount outstanding would be paid off. Billam was given a 26-week jail term suspended for two years, ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work and he will be subject to an electronically monitored daily curfew for four months. A spokesman for the Department of Work and Pensions said: 'Billam was very brazen about what he was doing. 'It's hard to believe someone can think they are entitled to incapacity benefits because they claim they can't walk far without assistance. 'Yet we observed him on three consecutive Sundays, running around, jumping and heading the ball and putting in some strong tackles.'

Article: (CNN)Sky watchers in western North America are in for a treat: a nearly five-minute total lunar eclipse this morning. Here's how it's unfolding:. It started at 3:16 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time, when the moon began moving into Earth's shadow.  For the next hour and 45 minutes, that shadow will move across the moon and engulf it at 4:58 a.m. Pacific Time. The total eclipse will only last four minutes and 43 seconds, and NASA says that makes it the shortest one of the century. Watch it live on NASA TV. While people west of the Mississippi River will have the best view, at least a partial eclipse will be visible across the nation. But sunrise will interrupt the show on the East Coast. Parts of South America, India, China and Russia also will be able to see the eclipse, but it won't be visible in Greenland, Iceland, Europe, Africa or the Middle East. A lunar eclipse happens when the sun, Earth and moon form a straight line in space, with the Earth smack in the middle. The sun shines on the Earth and creates a shadow. As the moon moves deeper into that shadow, it appears to turn dark and may even appear to be a reddish color.  Why red? Because Earth's atmosphere is filtering out most of the blue light. Some people have nicknamed the effect the "blood moon." NASA says lunar eclipses typically happen at least twice a year, but this eclipse is the third in a series of four in a row, known as a "tetrad."  The first was on April 15, 2014. The second was in September 2014, the next is Saturday and there will be one more, on September 28. If you want to learn more about the eclipse, NASA astronomer Mitzi Adams will take questions on Twitter @NASA_Marshall. Did you see the total lunar eclipse? Share your photos with CNN iReport.

Article: Tiger Woods was genial. Tiger Woods was charm personified. Tiger Woods is the 111th best golfer in the world. You can grin your way through life as the 111th best golfer in the world. No pressure. No big whoop. Judging by some of the stuff said and written about Woods in the build-up to his 20th Masters, it will be an achievement if he makes the cut. Very respected names have close to begged him not to compete. Woods doesn’t see it like that at all. He’s in it to win it. And it’s in those little moments that the old Tiger — some would argue the real Tiger — breaks cover again. Tiger Woods was all smiles as he played a practice around ahead of his 20th appearance at the Masters. The former best player in the world arrives at Augusta ranked a lowly 111th in the game. Woods name appears on the Masters' tournament winner's board four times; 1997, 2001, 2002 and 2005. It was all smiles and wise-cracks as Woods sat before the assembled press on Tuesday. Questions that would once have been greeted with terse disregard were warmly expanded upon. Memory lane was tripped down, the elder statesman played. He even referred to some of the correspondents in the room as his friends. And then he was asked where a win this week, from one ranking place lower than Tomohiro Kondo of Japan, at a point in his career when it was wondered whether he would be seen on the golf course as a competing professional again, would rank in his career achievements. And up leapt old Tiger. He didn’t answer this one with a short, evocative speech or a ready quip. He shut it down, old school. One sentence, no messing, no prospect of elaboration. Woods has insisted that he would not enter a tournament unless he thought he had a chance of winning it. The 39-year-old looks towards the ground after hitting a shot during practice on Monday. Woods smiles as he talks with his traditional practice partner Mark O'Meara (left) at Augusta. ‘It would be my 15th major,’ said Woods. The temperature in the room dropped by several degrees. Brevity replaced levity. The questioner, gamely, tried again with a slight rephrase. ‘Long way to go before that,’ Woods replied. ‘Lot of work to do.’ He smiled. The chill passed. And, of course, that is exactly what it would be. Just his 15th major, if it signalled a true return to form. And on to the next one. World No 4 Jordan Spieth was in ninth grade — 14 years old — when Woods won his last major in 2008. But if he could win a fifth Masters he would be back in the game. And no more Mr Nice Guy, one feels. From 111th in the world, Woods has time to take the scenic route in conversation. Back to where he was, back to contending, he would be all business again. Not entirely like before, of course, because he could never go back to before — but not many of the guys who are genuinely fancied to be wearing the green jacket on Sunday night practised as Woods did, with partner and kids in tow. Woods gets a hug from his children,  Charlie and Sam, who will carry his bag for the par three tournament. Woods' girlfriend Lindsey Vonn leads the pair around the course to watch their father practice. Ski champion Vonn has a chat with tournament favourite Rory McIlroy during practice. As Woods putted, Lindsey Vonn, a world champion skier, clutched Charlie and Sam and chatted to a passing Rory McIlroy. The contrast was clear. McIlroy, whose easy manner and charisma require no effort, is not here to smell the azaleas. He is the world’s best golfer, on the brink of a third consecutive major in what would be a personal Grand Slam — only the sixth in the world to do it. He has a lot at stake. Woods is on bonus time. In January, he shot an 82, 11-over-par, at the Waste Management Phoenix Open, his worst round in close to 13 years. A week later, he walked off at Torrey Pines after 11 holes citing back problems. His partner that day, Chris DiMarco, thought it was more out of embarrassment. ‘He wasn’t doing anything good,’ he said. Woods then took an indefinite break from golf, with claims he had the chipping yips. On Monday he admitted being stuck between two release patterns, which amounts to the same thing. When he spoke of his journey to this point of return, it was clear he regards it as the second — maybe third, considering the events of 2009 — phase of his career. Woods shot the worst round of his professional career, an 82 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open. Woods speaks to the world's media after withdrawing from the first round of the Farmers Insurance Open. The 14 major winner stands at the tee as the Augusta course is mowed ahead of this year's tournament. ‘People would never understand how much work I put in to come back and do this again,’ he said. ‘I worked my ass off, that’s the easiest way to describe it. I worked hard. Sun up to sun down. When the kids were in school, I’d be doing it. When they went to sleep, still doing it. ‘The way I saw it, if I started when the sun came up I’d be a better player when it set. Getting better incrementally. It would come in flashes. It would come for 10 minutes and then I’d lose it for an hour. Then I’d get it back. Gradually, it flipped. I’d have it for an hour, lose it for 10 minutes. And then it was just there. There were some frustrating moments, but I had to stick with it. There were times when clubs flew, when a few suddenly slipped out of my hand — and travelled some good distances. ‘But we kept working, shot by shot, hour by hour. It was slow and steady, just taking little bits of progression. I had to hammer it out, make sure it was engrained. I just had to get through it.’ Woods smiles after winning his last major in a play-off with Rocco Mediate at the 2008 US Open. The all conquering American celebrates winning the Masters after sinking a play-off putt in 2005. Nick Faldo slips the green jacket on Woods after he won his first major at the 1997 Masters. And now he’s through it. And America waits. For while nobody expects the player one better than Hennie Otto of South Africa to beat among the most competitive Masters fields in the modern era, that doesn’t mean there is not a desperate yearning for the impossible to happen. It doesn’t help that the man in Woods’s place is not Bubba Watson, or Rickie Fowler, or any of the other star spangled pretenders, but a 25-year-old from Belfast who plays for the wrong team when the Ryder Cup is on. America likes Rory, but it loves Tiger. His victories once caused a spike in Wall Street’s Monday morning figures, and golf’s television numbers have not recovered from his spell in recovery. So the positive lines in Woods’s Masters preparation are lapped up and thrown out as a potential feelgood hit of the summer. That’s why Woods is still, against all logic, asked about winning here. Why he plays the game, and talks about winning right back at them. ‘I prepare to win and expect to go and do that,’ he said. ‘I’ve come close in the last 10 years. Half of the tournaments since 2005 I had a chance on the back nine. I just didn’t get it done. For whatever reason, I didn’t seize the opportunity.’ The former champion has spoken of practicing his game from dawn until dusk to hone his swing. Woods latest comeback has sparked a tidal wave of interest from American supporters and beyond. The room seemed pleased with the answer. Woods was asked what, at 39, remained his greatest motivation. ‘Winning,’ deadpanned old Tiger, suddenly solemn. And then he smiled. ‘I like it,’ he said, before disappearing through a side door. Tiger Woods is the 111th best golfer in the world and entirely at ease with that. For now.

Tiger Woods begins his 20th Masters ranked a lowly 111th in the world. Former world No 1 turned on the charm ahead of Masters 2015 at Augusta. American was joined by girlfriend Lindsay Vonn and his children. A fifth green jacket would take the 39-year-old's major haul to 15. CLICK HERE for all the latest news from the Masters 2015.

Article: Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure is a dream target for Inter Milan, according to general director Marco Fassone. The Italian giants are keen to sign the 31-year-old this summer, a player Inter coach Roberto Mancini knows well having guided him from 2010 until 2013 at the Barclays Premier League club. Gazzetta dello Sport claim Inter are prepared to submit an offer of 60million euros (£43million) for the Ivory Coast international, who is under contract with the Blues outfit until June 2017. Serie A side Inter Milan hope to sign Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure (front) this summer. Inter general director Marco Fassone fears City's asking price and Toure's wages could be too much. 'Who doesn't dream of having a player like him? Toure would give our midfield line something that we are lacking,' Fassone told Italian sports newspaper Tuttosport. 'But his wages and City's asking price might be a big obstacle.' Toure has scored seven goals and set up one more in 22 Premier League appearances this term for City. Inter are also working on new deals for their Argentina forward Mauro Icardi and Croatia midfielder Mateo Kovacic. Icardi is Inter's top scorer this season with 15 goals and is tied to the Nerazzurri for a further three seasons, while Kovacic, who is a reported target of Liverpool, is under contract with inter until June 2019. Inter striker Mauro Icardi is on the verge of signing a new contract with the club, according to Marco Fassone. Mateo Kovacic, pictured celebrating a goal against Cagliari, is also in talks over an extended deal. 'We are almost there with respect to Icardi's contract extension,' Fassone said. 'We want to keep him just as we want to keep Kovacic. 'We will evaluate with great care (their) eventual offers. 'It's clear that if we want to sign three players (this summer) we will need to evaluate those that will depart.' Inter's priority right now is to tie Inter goalkeeper Samir Handanovic to a long-term contract. Goalkeeper Samir Handanovic, pictured against Napoli, has been linked with Roma and Manchester United. The Slovenia international has been linked with Roma as well as Manchester United and becomes a free agent next season. 'Handanovic's renewal is an issue that we must resolve at once,' Fassone said. 'We need to understand what he wants. 'We cannot go into next season knowing that our goalkeeper's contract expires.' Inter are currently 10th in Serie A with 10 league games remaining.

Article: Celtic retained their seven-point lead at the top of the Scottish Premiership with an easy 2-0 win over 10-man Partick at Parkhead. The home side laid siege to the Thistle defence at the start of the match but had to rely on a Kris Commons penalty a minute before the break to give them the interval lead. Thistle midfielder James Craigen had been shown a straight red card by referee Willie Collum for a 'last man' foul on Hoops midfielder Stuart Armstrong to concede the spot-kick. leaving the visitors a player down for the second half. Stuart Armstrong is brought down by Partick Thistle's James Craigen leading to a penalty. Referee Willie Collum shows Craigen a read card for his 'last man' challenge on Armstrong. Celtic striker Kris Commons steps up to convert the penalty to give his side a 1-0 lead before the break. Commons (right) races away to celebrates his 45th minute penalty strike. Midfielder Stefan Johansen, stand-in skipper in the absence of suspended Scott Brown, added a second in the 63rd minute as the encounter turned into a Hoops procession. With second-placed Aberdeen beating Inverness 1-0, Ronny Deila's side maintained the gap over the Dons but also have a game in hand as the title race draws closer to conclusion. With a heavy schedule in mind, the Hoops boss returned midfielder Nir Bitton, Gary Mackay-Steven and striker John Guidetti his starting line-up. Thistle manager Alan Archibald was forced into one change with forward Kallum Higginbotham coming in for the injured Kris Doolan but he was mostly a spectator as the Firhill defence was forced to withstand an early Hoops' barrage. Celtic came close twice before two minutes had elapsed. Stefan Johansen doubles Celtic's advantage in the 63rd minute with left-footed shot into the bottom corner. Johansen is mobbed by his team-mates following his second-half strike. Parkhead defender Virgil van Dijk, up for a corner, flicked an Armstrong cross against the crossbar at the near post before a desperate blocking tackle by Maryhill defender Conrad Balatoni prevented an almost certain goal from Johansen's drive. Balatoni again came to Thistle rescue in the ninth minute, beating Guidetti to a header in front of an empty goal, after left-back Emilio Izaguirre had troubled Fox after surging into the penalty area. Moments later, Mackay-Steven was set up Johansen but his goalbound drive from 12 yards was deflected away by Thistle defender Callum Booth. Yet, in the 21st minute, in a rare attack, the visitors almost snatched the lead but Higginbotham's spectacular volley from 14 yards was saved by Craig Gordon - but only on the stretch. Commons' long-distance drive in the 28th minute just cleared the bar but a minute before the break he was more accurate from the spot, firing the penalty low into the corner giving the despairing Fox no chance. Leigh Griffiths spurns a glorious opportunity to put Celtic 3-0 ahead late in the match. The goal came as some relief to the home fans who had grown slightly irritated as the first half wore on. Two minutes after the break Commons forced Fox into a decent save with a powerful 25-yard drive and while the Maryhill defence cleared their lines from rebound it looked ominous. Thistle continued to defend stoutly and desperately in equal measures but were undone again when Johansen took a clever Guidetti pass before rolling the ball into the corner of the net from 10 yards. Two minutes after replacing Guidetti, Leigh Griffiths somehow turned a Mackay-Steven cross past the far post from two yards out but it was inconsequential. In the 79th minute, with the game drifting, Gordon made another good save, this time from Thistle substitute Gary Fraser, on for Stuart Bannigan. Johansen came close at the other end with a chip which Fox tipped over the bar, after the Norwegian had weaved his way through the Jags defence.

Kris Commons fired Celtic into the lead on the stroke of half-time. Partick Thistle's James Craigen was sent off before the penalty. Stefan Johansen doubled the home side's advantage in the 63rd minute.

Article: (CNN)The terrorist group Al-Shabaab has claimed an attack on Garissa University College in eastern Kenya, in which many people have been killed and still more taken hostage. The attack is another step in the ongoing escalation of the terrorist group's activities, and a clear indicator that the security situation in East Africa is deteriorating fast. Somalia-based Al-Shabaab has been behind a string of recent attacks in Kenya, the most well-known of them being the massacre at the Westgate Shopping Centre in Nairobi in 2013. Cross-border raids into Kenya by the group, however, date back to 2011. Al-Shabaab incursions triggered a military response by the government in Nairobi, which sent troops to Somalia as part of an African Union mission in support of Somalia's internationally recognized government that had been under pressure from Al-Shabaab and other militants for several years. Al-Shabaab is predominantly driven by the same radical interpretation of the Koran as al-Qaeda and ISIS (also known as Islamic State), but also employs more opportunistic approaches to shoring up local support. Its origins lie in Al-Ittihad al-Islami (Unity of Islam), one of several militant factions that emerged in the wake of the fall of Siad Barre in 1991. These disparate groups fought each other and a U.N. peacekeeping mission in the Somali civil war that led to the complete collapse of the country, from which it has yet to recover almost quarter of a century later. Al-Shabaab (literally "the Youth") split from Unity of Islam in 2003 and merged with another radical Islamist group, the so-called Islamic Courts Union. As their alliance obtained control of Somalia's capital Mogadishu in 2006, Ethiopia, the only majority Christian country in the region, took military action against the group. The offensive weakened Al-Shabaab and pushed it back into the rural areas of central and southern Somalia, but it failed to defeat it. To the contrary, Ethiopia's invasion and occupation of parts of Somalia -- although invited by the Somali government and backed by the African Union -- enabled Al-Shabaab to partially re-invent itself as both an Islamist and nationalist force opposing a foreign "Christian" invasion. Initially, the group primarily attacked Ethiopian forces, but soon began to "expand" its activities against the Somali government as well. The first attack outside Somalia was an attack in the Ugandan capital of Kampala in 2010. Soon after this, cross-border raids in Kenya began, predominantly targeting Christians there. Increasing its links with al-Qaeda, Al-Shabaab declared its full allegiance in 2012 -- and it is not clear whether it will switch allegiances to ISIS. Much will depend on how the relationships between al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), a long-time ally of Al-Shabaab based in Yemen, and ISIS develop. The key point is that Al-Shabaab's attack in Garissa is part of a broader regional context of instability fueled by a huge number of factors. It must not be interpreted simply as another act of garden-variety fundamentalist terrorism. Clearly, the presence and activities of terrorist groups in the region is a major concern, and it is undoubtedly driven by radical and exclusivist interpretations of Islam. But the entire region also suffers from a range of other problems: from economic development challenges to environmental degradation; from organized crime to inter-tribal and inter-communal violence; from corruption to serious deficits in human rights and good governance. These entrenched inequalities help Al-Shabaab appeal to a wide variety of potential recruits, who may sympathize with and actively support the group for any number of reasons. Attacking a university in northern Kenya and separating Christian from Muslim students epitomizes the way Al-Shabaab advances itself by exploiting religious, tribal and nationalist identities. Ultimately, though, this all comes down to a struggle for control -- over people, over territory, and over resources. As long as the majority of people in the region remain excluded from any meaningful political, economic, and social participation in their societies -- which are dominated by primarily self-interested elites that put their own advance before that of their communities -- human lives matter little in the pursuit of selfish interests. It is important to counter Al-Shabaab directly, including by military means. But there won't be any lasting solution to the wider region's security problems without a more comprehensive and concerted effort to address the deeper problems of exclusion suffered by the citizens of the countries challenged by Al-Shabaab. As Garissa shows, these problems are still providing oxygen for nihilistic ideologies and their deadly fruit. Copyright 2015 The Conversation. Some rights reserved.

Article: At the grand old age of 75, Jack Nicklaus is still capable of hitting aces. The Golden Bear added another magic moment to his storied career at Augusta National in the Par-3 Contest. Stepping up to the tee on the 130-yard fourth, the greatest golfer of all time saw his shot sail beyond the flag before spinning back into the hole. Jack Nicklaus gave the crowd something to cheer with a hole in one on the fourth during the Par-3 Contest. Nicklaus holds up his ball to an adoring crowd as Gary Player (left) and Ben Crenshaw salute the great. Crenshaw and Nicklaus fist pump following his ace on the 130-yard hole at Augusta National. Nicklaus was playing alongside Gary Player and Ben Crenshaw  as the first roar of Masters week filled the skies in a sunswept Georgia. 'I had an interview this morning, and I said "well, all I've got to do is go out and win the Par-3 and make a hole and one", and I make a hole in one,' Nicklaus said afterwards. The ace was Nicklaus' first on the hallowed turf of Augusta, but the veteran saw his achievement eclipsed by that of Camilo Villegas on a day which saw five hole-in-ones, levelling the record from 2002. The Colombian followed Nicklaus with an ace on the fourth and also managed one on the eighth, but he couldn't quite land the title, losing out to world No 74 Kevin Streelman in a play-off. Nicklaus became the youngest person to wear a green jacket in 1963, and collected his sixth in 1986. He is one of five men to complete the career grand slam, an accolade which favourite Rory McIlroy can achieve if he wins his third major in succession.

Article: Luis Suarez is quickly establishing himself in Barcelona folklore after impressing since his £75million move from Liverpool and the striker has revealed that years prior, he found himself sneaking into the Nou Camp. Speaking to Spanish radio station COPE, the forward spoke candidly about Real Madrid's interest in signing him and opened up about the infamous bite on Giorgio Chiellini during the World Cup. Suarez revealed that during a visit to his future club, he sneaked into the Nou Camp with his wife Sofia for a photo opportunity. Luis Suarez (9) has revealed that he once sneaked his way into the Nou Camp for a photograph. He said: 'It was not the first time that I came to Barcelona, it was the second. I went past the official store and saw it, but I did not go in because I didn't have money to buy anything. 'I was already going with Sofía and I remember that I saw an open door and I told her: 'Let's go'. 'You're crazy'. 'Come, just one photo'. 'No, no'. 'Yes, yes, yes. I'm going to go in'. I went in through the door that was open, she followed me and we started to run. 'We stood on the stairs and took a photo with all of the stadium behind us. I still haven't found the photo. Then we ran, and we were nervous. It was the only time that I had entered. My father-in-law managed to enter another time to see Argentina-Catalunya, on December 27.' The Uruguayan lit up the 'El Clasico' last month, where he scored the winner to send his side top of La Liga but he could have been playing for the opposition, if he'd not decided to move to Catalonia. The Uruguayan has been in fine form for Barcelona following his move and is becoming a fan's favourite.

Talk of a move to the Spanish capital had been rife during his years at Liverpool but Suarez revealed that there was only one club which caught his eye. He said: 'Madrid were very interested in me, but my dream was always Barcelona. When I heard the name of Barca, I did not hesitate at any moment.' Arguably Suarez's most famous, yet controversial moment, when he bit Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil and being banned for four-months. 'The bite on Chiellini was the worst moment of my career,' he said. 'I let myself down, my country, my wife and my children. The bites were partly my fault and partly [due to] the provocation of Ivanovic and Chiellini. Now they continue provoking me, but now I go or speak well. I am more intelligent.' Suarez admits that the bite was the worst moment of his career as he received a four-month playing ban. The attackers bite Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini during the 2014 World Cup group game last July.

Article: Every one of Africa's 54 member countries will vote for Sepp Blatter in next month's FIFA presidential election, the continent's soccer boss said on Tuesday, referring to the 79-year-old Swiss as 'dear Sepp.' In front of Blatter's three challengers, Issa Hayatou, president of the Confederation of African Football, promised unanimous support in his speech to open CAF's annual congress in Cairo. 'Africa is comfortable having you. Africa stays with you,' Hayatou said, according to a transcript of his comments provided by CAF. Sepp Blatter (left) has received the full backing of African football's president Issa Hayatou (right) Blatter was also present, and made a speech to the African football leaders in his role as FIFA president. Although the individual countries don't have to follow Hayatou's directive, Africa is expected to be a strong base of support for Blatter. With 54 of the 209 FIFA member countries eligible to vote in the presidential election in Zurich on May 29, Africa is the largest of the six continental confederations. The praise Blatter received in Egypt contrasted to his uncomfortable reception at the UEFA congress last month, when his presidency was criticized by the three candidates standing against him, and some European officials. Luis Figo (left) and Michael van Pragg (right) are opposing Blatter and have chosen to run for presidency. Hayatou, a FIFA vice president and now an ally of Blatter after failing to unseat him in 2002, made an apparent reference to that UEFA congress on Tuesday. 'Dear Sepp,' he said. 'I want to reiterate that here in Africa you are never on some strange or hostile territory. You shall always be at home here, on this continent.' Blatter is seeking a fifth term in office to extend a reign that began in 1998. FIFA vice president Prince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan, Dutch FA head Michael van Praag, and former Portugal international Luis Figo are standing against him. Prince Ali bin al-Hussein is the third challenger and the FIFA vice-president was in attendance in Zimbabwe. Those three challengers won't be addressing CAF delegates like they did at UEFA's congress. CAF said the three were attending merely as 'observers.' In his speech, Blatter reflected on Africa's achievements during his time as FIFA president, including the continent's first World Cup in South Africa in 2010. He said Cameroon's Hayatou, who has led CAF for 27 years despite allegations of corruption and an official reprimand by the IOC, was a 'pillar' of African football, according to CAF.

Article: (CNN)Easter is a cornerstone event in the Christian faith, but it's surrounded by interesting quirks. It celebrates the completion of Christ's mission of salvation in the Crucifixion and Resurrection. By dying on Good Friday, Christ atoned for the sins of others; by rising from the grave on Sunday, Christ conquered death. Simple enough and reason for Christians to celebrate. But, like Christmas with its tree, ornaments and Santa Claus, Easter has picked up its peripheral trappings -- the bunny and colorful eggs.  Unlike Christmas, it doesn't fall on the same day every year but shifts around in spring depending upon cosmic events. And that blood moon we just had -- is it pure coincidence that it fell around Easter? (No.) Here's a journey from the Vatican to the Holy Land, around the moon and the Earth's tilting axis, to Germany and the United States to try to explain the complex holiday called Easter. And you'll learn to how to color Easter eggs with Kool-Aid. Let's start at the Vatican. At the Vatican, Holy Week began with Palm Sunday last week and culminated in Easter Sunday Mass with multiple celebrations in between to mark the final week of Christ's mortal life. Jesus rode on the back of a donkey into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday where crowds celebrated him as the Messiah and laid down palm branches in his path. But the crowd and the Romans turned on him in the course of the week, according to the Bible, leading to his crucifixion and resurrection. Rain sprinkled down on worshipers standing under a sea of umbrellas as they gathered in a gray St. Peter's Square on Sunday to partake in the outdoor services held by Pope Francis. Afterward, the Pontiff took a moment to tell the world to do right those in need in his Urbi et Orbi address. Francis lamented the suffering of people in many of the conflicts around the globe. From Nigeria to South Sudan, Iraq to Ukraine, he expressed hope that violence would end. Francis also doesn't put on airs. This week he washed the feet of believers, repeating the Biblical account of a woman, a sinner, washing Jesus' feet and anointing them with oil. Let's move on to old Jerusalem, the birthplace of Easter. The Church of the Holy Sepulcher in old Jerusalem unifies the spot where Christ was crucified -- Calvary -- with his tomb, or sepulcher. On Sunday, Catholics and Armenian Christians celebrated the Resurrection there. In the morning, the Latin Patriarch, the Archbishop of Jerusalem, entered the basilica. Then mass was held followed by a procession. But a large group of indigenous Christians didn't join them. It's not quite Easter yet in the Holy Land for Eastern Orthodox Christians. They'll be celebrating a week from now, because they determine Easter's date by a different calendar than Western Christians -- the Julian calendar. Which brings us to the question of how astronomy is used to determine the date of Easter Sunday. A blood moon appeared in the sky early Saturday, right between Good Friday and Easter Sunday and during Passover. Just a coincidence? Not completely, because the dates for both Passover -- the Jewish holiday celebrating the deliverance from slavery in Egypt -- and Easter are determined by moon phases, according to timeanddate.com. Easter's timing is related to Passover, because Jesus was crucified around then, according to the Bible. Many Jewish holidays, including Passover, fall on full moon, which is also a prerequisite for a lunar eclipse, the event that turns the moon a blood red color. Since the timing of moon phases doesn't jibe with Earth's orbit -- which is how we determine the length of a year now -- Passover's exact date moves around -- and so does Easter's. When Christian bishops first convened at the Council of Nicaea in the year 325, they made a rule to determine the date of Easter, so as to fairly reliably pin it to Passover:. It would fall on the first Sunday after the first full moon following the vernal equinox. That's the day in March when Earth's axis reaches a midpoint between winter and summer and the day and night are of equal length. But... if the full moon fell on Sunday, Easter would be pushed down a week. Confusing? It got worse. When the West moved from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar, Orthodox Christians stayed put, resulting in -- usually -- two separate dates for Easter. In 1997, the World Council of Churches pushed for a unified method of determining a date based on astronomical occurrences. It didn't catch on. But some odd Easter trappings that popped up after the Middle Ages very much have -- the eggs and the bunny. The bunny is an egg-laying pagan that worships the moon. That's one notion of its origins, but probably not the actual one. German immigrants appear to have brought it to North America in the 1700s. German historians are not clear on its beginnings, but the first known mention of the bunny and the eggs in writing was in 1682. Professor of medicine Georg Franck von Frankenau described in his paper "De ovis paschalibus," or "On Easter eggs," a custom in the Alsace region involving a bunny and eggs, according to German public television. Some also credit the region with inadvertently inventing the Christmas tree. But von Frankenau left out any explanation of how the tradition arose, leading to a number of theories in Germany. One common idea: During Lent, people had to abstain from eating eggs, but hens kept on laying them, so farmers boiled and preserved them. By the time Easter rolled around, they were practically swimming in them. They had to figure out something to do with them when the holiday hit. Play hide and seek with them; color them; give them as gifts. Parents may have invented the bunny as a playful explanation for children on where the Easter eggs came from. If you're coloring eggs this year, here's an interesting tip.  Instead of stinking up your place with the smell of vinegar, use Kool-Aid, YouTube science geek Grant Thompson suggests. And it appears to work. Just use a whole packet in a small glass of hot water and gently lay the eggs in. They turn out as bright as they would in any other food dye. But be careful, it stains everything else, like clothes and upholstery, Thompson warns. That's why your tongue changes colors when you drink it. Happy Easter! Happy Passover!

Article: Manchester City's youngsters finished off a job well done against Leicester City, adding to their 3-0 first-leg lead with two late goals from Isaac Buckley and Brandon Barker at the King Power Stadium. Layton Ndukwu had given Leicester hope of clawing back the advantage with 20 minutes to go but substitute Buckley and Barker struck to kill that dream off and set up a final against Chelsea later this month. City will face Chelsea at a venue, likely to to be the City Football Academy Stadium, in the first leg on April 20 before travelling to Stamford Bridge a week later on April 27. Manchester City's Isaac Buckley Ricketts (left) celebrates scoring at the King Power Stadium on Wednesday. Manchester City's players celebrate after they consolidated their first leg lead to reach the Youth Cup final. Leicester City: Smith-Varnham, Miles, Chilwell (c), Choudhury, Kipre, Johnson, Bailey (Barnes 62), Fox, King, Rowe (Muskwe 72), Ndukwu. Unused subs: Knight, Bramley, Dombrauskis,. Bookings: Choudhury. Manchester City: Haug, Maffeo, Humphreys, Oliver, Angelino, Bryan (c) (Bullock 92), Nemane, Wood (Buckley 46), Celina, Garcia, Barker. Unused subs: Albinson, Fernandes, Dilrosun. Bookings: Wood, Bryan, Angelino. With City holding a big advantage from the first leg last month, this clash always looked difficult for Leicester, and their inability to find an early goal made the task of overhauling the advantage even tougher. City were the better team for much of the first half but goalkeeper Kjetil Haug had to be aware to keep out Hamza Choudhury from close range at the other end. That was their best chance until Charlie Oliver handled inside his own penalty area with 20 minutes to go to gift Ndukwu the chance to give the home side the lead. That opportunity was one he gratefully accepted, confidently dispatching his spot-kick past Haug. Layton Ndukwu of Leicester City scores from a penalty to cut the deficit but it was not Leicester's night. Brandon Barker (right) scored City's second goal of the evening as they made it to a first final in seven years. Despite still holding a decent lead, City surged forward in response and Buckley equalised, thumping home Barker's cross. And Buckley effectively returned the favour when he was hauled down inside the area moments later to allow Barker to make it 5-1 on aggregate from the spot. City march on and face Chelsea in a rematch of their last final in this competition seven years ago. The Premier League champions' youth side won 4-2 on aggregate on that occasion and will be hoping for a repeat this year.

Article: Chelsea match-winner Cesc Fabregas hailed a vital win after his late goal gave his side a 1-0 victory over QPR at Loftus Road. The game looked to be heading for a stalemate before Fabregas' 88th minute shot - their first on target in the game - found its way past Rob Green. The win moved Jose Mourinho's men seven points clear at the top of the table and Fabregas admitted it was an important goal. Midfielder Cesc Fabregas runs away in celebration having scored a vital winner in the 88th minute. 'It was vital. We know that we are playing for the most important trophy of the season,' the midfielder told Sky Sports. 'We're there in first place and we want to continue that.' He also paid tribute to the performance of QPR, saying: 'They were very difficult to play but we showed great mentality and never gave up in the difficult moments.' Cesc Fabregas wore a  protective mask during Chelsea's clash with QPR after breaking his nose last week. Cesc Fabregas' low strike, Chelsea's first shot on target, was enough to secure the win at Loftus Road. Chelsea striker Didier Drogba struggled to impose his game on a resolute QPR defence on Sunday. Blues striker Dider Drogba added: 'We had belief. We always play until the end. It was a tough game but the good thing with this team is we always play to the end.' Mourinho knew the win moved his side one step closer to a fifth league title, despite them having to work hard for it. 'Our situation was very positive. One point would be one less point we need, but the reality is that three points is always three points and one less match we need to win so is a very important step in a very important match,' he said. Nemanja Matic hugs his goalscoring team-mate Fabregas after the final whistle at Loftus Road. 'It was a very difficult match where the best quality was to control the game very well and stop our opponents scoring. 'They are a team that can score goals and have dangerous, attacking players so our best quality in the game was to keep calm and try to play against a team that was very well organised defensively and did a fantastic job,' added Mourinho. 'After that you have lots of times in the season when you win points or lose points in the end of the game, and we won two points in the last two minutes.'

Article: (CNN)After years of making the case that the education of athletes is paramount, the NCAA now says it has no legal responsibility to make sure education is actually delivered. On its website, the NCAA prominently states, "It's our commitment -- and our responsibility -- to give young people opportunities to learn, play and succeed." And later, it says that "in the collegiate model of sports, the young men and women competing on the field or court are students first, athletes second." But the NCAA is taking a very different position in response to a lawsuit filed by former University of North Carolina athletes. The lawsuit claimed the students didn't get an education because they were caught up in the largest known academic fraud scandal in NCAA history. In its response, the NCAA says it has no legal responsibility "to ensure the academic integrity of the courses offered to student-athletes at its member institutions." Even with pages of online information about academic standards, and even though the NCAA has established a system of academic eligibility and accountability that it boasts of regularly, NCAA attorneys wrote in this court filing that "the NCAA did not assume a duty to ensure the quality of the education of student-athletes," and "the NCAA does not have 'direct, day-to-day, operational control' " over member institutions like UNC. "It's nonsense. It's double talk," said Gerald Gurney, a former athletic-academic director who is now president of The Drake Group for academic integrity in collegiate sport. "If you look at their basic core principles, it's all about academics, the experience, the integration of academics, and the education of the student is paramount," Gurney said. "They seem to talk out of both sides of their mouths." The NCAA referred calls for comment to an online statement, which read in part:. The NCAA believes that the lawsuit misunderstands the NCAA's role with respect to its member schools and ignores the myriad steps the NCAA has taken to assist student-athletes in being equipped to excel both in the classroom and on the playing field. "This case is troubling for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that the law does not and has never required the NCAA to ensure that every student-athlete is actually taking full advantage of the academic and athletic opportunities provided to them," said Donald Remy, NCAA chief legal officer. In its response to the lawsuit, it also likened its role to that of the American Bar Association or American Medical Association, and said that those entities are not sued every time a lawyer or doctor acts inappropriately. The scandal at UNC involved thousands of athletes who, over 18 years, were funneled into classes that never met, where advisers fudged grades and accepted plagiarism so that athletes who were falling behind in class could remain eligible to play sports. Mary Willingham, the UNC whistleblower turned NCAA critic, has for years said that athletes across the country are accepted to colleges even though they're academically underprepared and then pushed into classes where little work is required. The system of eligibility that the NCAA brags about, she says, is a sham. "Why do we go through the trouble of compliance if we can't legitimize that the courses are real and the education is real anyway? It makes no sense," said Willingham, who recently wrote a book about the UNC scandal called "Cheated." "If they can't legitimize that the academics are real and take no responsibility for that, then why certify students semester after semester to play? It's lost its meaning for me." The NCAA's claim that it's hands-off when it comes to athletics seems to be a direct contradiction of what the organization has been repeating for years, not just in the rhetoric on its website, but in speeches by its president, Mark Emmert, and in court defending itself from numerous lawsuits over paying athletes. For example, before it lost a case filed by former UCLA player Ed O'Bannon, suing for the right of athletes to make money off their images and likenesses, the NCAA stood on the pillar of amateurism, insisting that college athletes are paid with an education. That's the defense the NCAA is now using in another class action filed by big-time sports attorney Jeffrey Kessler, seeking to make college sports a free market where athletes are paid salaries based on their value. In response, the NCAA said that what sets college sports apart from pros is education: Consistent with "its commitment to amateurism, member institutions conduct their athletics programs for students who choose to participate in intercollegiate athletics as a part of their educational experience and in accordance with NCAA bylaws." Attorney Michael Hausfeld, who represented both O'Bannon and now the UNC athletes, said this:. "This startling inconsistency is unfortunately all too symptomatic of the NCAA's shifting rhetoric and faltering commitment to its college athletes. NCAA President Mark Emmert has repeatedly proposed that 'What we live for is the education of our athletes,' but the NCAA's record tells a far different story." But Rick Burton, professor of sport management at Syracuse University, said it's not realistic to think that the NCAA would regulate every professor and every course an athlete might take at each university across the country. "I understand, I think, where the NCAA is coming from. We would not let the NCAA come in and tell us how to run our chemistry department at Syracuse University," he said. "It sounds like someone is trying to say the NCAA should have been supervising that department at the University of North Carolina, and there's no logic to that," he said. "The people who are saying the NCAA should be held accountable for academics at every school are just looking for an opportunity to throw rocks at the NCAA." UNC, which was also sued, has admitted to the fraud, but also asked for a judge to throw out the case, saying the athletes waited too long -- seven years -- to sue and the "educational malpractice" theory doesn't apply. UNC claims it is protected by state law. This is reminiscent of another NCAA reversal. The NCAA, which was founded a century ago to protect athletes from "dangerous and exploitive athletic practices," now says it does not enforce health and safety rules. In fact, in response to a lawsuit filed by the family of a player who died in 2011, the NCAA wrote: "The NCAA denies that it has a legal duty to protect student-athletes." A CNN investigation found that the NCAA has failed to open investigations in several cases where safety rules allegedly were broken. It has also fallen behind in imposing rules for concussions -- far behind even the NFL. Ramogi Huma, president of the National College Players Association, and a leading thorn in the NCAA's side for decades, said this latest backpedaling from the NCAA leaves him wondering why the organization exists at all. "There's nothing left the NCAA can claim it does that is beneficial to college athletes or society. One has to wonder what does the NCAA do if it doesn't protect players? If it doesn't play a role in the education of college athletics? It begs the question of why does the NCAA exist -- and why does it have a tax exemption."

Article: Daniel Ricciardo has called for a back-to-basics approach for Red Bull to forge a return to the front of the grid. Second best to Mercedes last season after a run of four successive championship triumphs, Red Bull have struggled at the start of this year. To rub salt into the wounds, Red Bull even found themselves trailing'sister' team Toro Rosso at the last race in Malaysia. Daniel Ricciardo in action during practice for this weekend's Chinese Grand Prix. The Australian driver has urged his Red Bull team to go back to basics after a troubled start to 2015. The main gripe has centred on power-unit supplier Renault, with billionaire benefactor Dietrich Mateschitz suggesting this week he could pull his team out of the sport if matters fail to improve. Ahead of this weekend's grand prix in China, Ricciardo concedes Red Bull are exploring numerous avenues to correct the problems. The Australian managed to finish third quickest in practice, a second behind reigning champion Lewis Hamilton in his Mercedes and four tenths of a second adrift of Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen. 1. Lewis Hamilton Mercedes 1:37.219. 2. Kimi Raikkonen Ferrari 1:37.662. 3. Daniel Ricciardo Red Bull - Renault 1:38.311. 4. Sebastian Vettel Ferrari 1:38.339. 5. Nico Rosberg Mercedes 1:38.399. 6. Daniil Kvyat Red Bull - Renault 1:38.737. 7. Valtteri Bottas Williams-Mercedes 1:38.850. 8. Felipe Nasr Sauber - Ferrari 1:39.032. 9. Romain Grosjean Lotus - Mercedes 1:39.142. 10.

Max Verstappen Toro Rosso - Renault 1:39.894. 15. Carlos Sainz Jr Toro Rosso - Renault 1:39.971. 16. Nico Hulkenberg  Force India - Mercedes 1:40.151. 17. Felipe Massa Williams-Mercedes 1:40.423. 18. Sergio Perez Force India - Mercedes 1:40.868. 19. Roberto Merhi  Marussia - Ferrari 1:42.973. 20. Will Stevens  Marussia - Ferrari 1:44.564. 'We are experimenting with a few things, but I think for now we have to go back to what we know, get our basics right,' said Ricciardo. 'We have done quite a bit. In Malaysia we had brake issues, a lot of overheating, so we have reverted back on a few things, even from last year which we knew was more efficient. 'Just because it's from last year it doesn't mean it's not better, so I guess we have taken a step back in that direction. The team has done quite a lot to rectify some issues and get us further up the grid.' Ricciardo has no doubt Renault are also pulling their weight, adding: 'From Melbourne to Malaysia they made a pretty massive step with driveability. 'We also have a few more software things this weekend, which should give things another pretty significant step on that side. 'I appreciate what everyone is doing to get us back towards the front, so fingers crossed it can be put together in the right way this weekend and if so we can get back into that top five.' Daniil Kvyat was forced to pull off track 19 minutes from the end of FP2 after his brakes caught fire. Team-mate Daniil Kvyat, however, was not so fortunate as the young Russian was forced to pull off track 19 minutes from the end of FP2 after his brakes caught fire. Christian Horner said: 'Something overheated within the rear hub assembly. As a result of that we lost pressure in the master cylinder halfway round the lap. 'We asked him to drive back slowly without using the brakes if at all possible, but unfortunately he had to brake at turn 14 and he had a very slow off. 'It's frustrating it's happened, but all the relevant pieces are intact so we can find out what the root cause was.' Despite suffering brake issues in Malaysia, Horner insists the issue there and the one experienced by Kvyat are 'totally unrelated'. Horner added: 'Today was a one-off and can be sorted for tomorrow.'

Article: Wakefield coach James Webster explained how tough his club were finding life after their 80-0 First Utility Super League thrashing by Warrington Wolves. The Wildcats are rooted to the foot of the table after eight consecutive defeats. The rout saw a hat-trick of tries by Wolves' Richie Myler and a 28-point haul for Stefan Ratchford. Gene Ormsby claimed two tries along with Toby King and Ben Currie. The other tries came from Daryl Clark, Ashton Sims, Ben Westwood, Ben Currie and Joel Monaghan. Wakefield Wildcats coach James Webster said after the game he does not have enough players. Webster said: 'Over six weeks now we haven't had a seven-day turnaround and we find it hard to find some energy. 'I hate looking for excuses but over the last month I think we have spent around two hours as a team training together, for the simple reason I don't have enough people to fulfil training. 'There are no ifs and buts about that — I just don't have enough players. 'We trained for half an hour on our last run as a team simply because we need all our players playing or we will not fulfil our fixtures.' Regarding the defeat to Wolves he added: 'We were totally outclassed. Full credit to Warrington they were outstanding.' The Wildcats now face a Challenge Cup tie against Championship outfit Halifax on Friday night.

Article: Robin van Persie has declared himself fit for Sunday's Manchester derby. Van Persie has missed Manchester United's last six games following an ankle injury he suffered in the 2-1 defeat at Swansea on February 21. Manager Louis van Gaal said last week he did not expect the striker to be fit enough to return for Sunday's game against Manchester City at Old Trafford, but Van Persie reported good news for United fans on Wednesday. Robin van Persie has declared himself fit for the Manchester derby after missing United's last six games. Louis van Gaal will be pleased to have Van Persie back but he is unlikely to start the game. The 31-year-old tweeted: 'Back to training with the group today. Was a great session. Happy to be fit and able to play again. Looking forward to my next game!' Even if Van Gaal considers Van Persie to be fit to take part in the derby, it is hard to see how the former Arsenal front man would fit into the starting XI. United have hardly missed the Dutchman, who has scored just 10 goals this term. During his absence, the Red Devils have only lost once - against his former employers Arsenal in the FA Cup. United have recorded creditable victories over Tottenham and Liverpool and last Saturday they moved above City into third with a 3-1 win over Aston Villa. Wayne Rooney scored a stunning volley during the win. The United skipper has performed well up front in a 4-3-3 formation alongside Ashley Young and Juan Mata, who scored both goals in the 2-1 win at Anfield two-and-a-half weeks ago. Marouane Fellaini has also provided able and robust support from midfield. Wayne Rooney celebrates with Radamel Falcao after scoring against Aston Villa at the weekend. Victory for United this weekend would pile more misery on out-of-form City and improve Van Gaal's chances of achieving his target of Champions League qualification. Once he returns from his summer break, he is likely to take United on a shortened pre-season tour, with the most likely destination the United States, it has emerged. Van Gaal made no secret of his annoyance at United's pre-season schedule last summer. United had already committed themselves to a three-week long tour that took in five matches across five American cities by the time Van Gaal took over as manager. United travelled almost 13,500 miles on the trip, which included games in Los Angeles, Denver, Detroit, Washington DC and Miami - all against high-profile opposition. This summer's tour is expected to see United take on fewer opponents and undertake less travel. The trip will have to be over a shorter period of time too as the Premier League season begins on August 8 - just eight weeks after the end of the international break. It is understood that Van Gaal will sign off plans for the tour in the coming weeks.

Manchester United have Robin van Persie back fit for Sunday. The Holland striker has been missing since February 21. It is unlikely that Van Persie will make United's starting XI against City.

Article: (CNN)A Connecticut teen who has been forced to have chemotherapy to treat Hodgkin lymphoma will remain in temporary custody of the state for the time being, according to her attorney, Josh Michtom. A Connecticut juvenile court judge issued a written decision Wednesday denying a motion to let the teen, identified in court documents as "Cassandra C.," go home. The judge also denied a motion for visitation. The 17-year-old is in remission after nearly six months of forced chemo treatments. On March 16, Michtom tried to convince the court that she should be able to return to her mother's home because she was no longer at imminent risk of harm from her illness. Michtom and attorney Michael Taylor, who represents Cassandra's mother, Jackie Fortin, released a written statement after receiving the judge's decision Wednesday: "We are disappointed in this ruling, not least of all because it draws a factual conclusion that is directly contradicted by the weight of the evidence. We're conferring with our clients now about next steps, including whether to take another appeal." Cassandra was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma in September and medical experts gave her an 85% chance of survival if treated with chemotherapy. Without it, doctors said at the time, she was likely to die within two years. She started chemotherapy in November but ran away after two days, according to court documents, when she decided she did not want to put the poison of the treatment into her body. In December, a judge ordered the young woman to be under the custody of the Connecticut Department of Children and Families. At that time, she was admitted to Connecticut Children's Medical Center in Hartford and has remained there since then.  Doctors surgically implanted a port in Cassandra's chest to administer chemotherapy medications, which began in spite of legal maneuvers to halt them. Cassandra is feeling well and is in good shape as far as her health is concerned, according to Michtom. "She's seen in her case the side effects weren't bad, and she's been well-treated by the nurses and doctors and does want to complete the treatment," he said. Her treatment is scheduled to wrap up this month. Michtom and Taylor failed in their effort before the Connecticut Supreme Court to make the case that Cassandra was mature enough to make her own medical decisions. Joette Katz, the commissioner of the Department of Children and Families, told CNN in March the agency is "very pleased with Cassandra's progress toward a complete recovery. We understand how difficult this has been for Cassandra and her family, but we have had full confidence throughout that the medical professionals involved in her treatment would be successful in saving her life." The agency has denied CNN's request to speak with Cassandra or her physicians. According to Michtom, the Department of Children and Families could have withdrawn its position for an order of custody but hasn't. He said the department sees Cassandra as a flight risk because she has run away before. Representatives for the department have said in court and in conversations with Michtom and Taylor that they will withdraw their pending neglect petition once Cassandra completes her last round of chemo -- expected around the end of April -- and that she'll be allowed to return home. So for now, Cassandra is said to spend her days reading, watching TV and drawing. "The hospital is effectively jail," Michtom said.

Article: Michael Vaughan, who is favourite to become England’s cricket supremo, was quick to condemn the openers after West Indies got them both out early on. With Jonathan Trott out without scoring in the first over and captain Alastair Cook failing again Vaughan said: ‘Their footwork and their mindset has been about looking to survive rather than getting on top.’ Geoff Boycott was also critical of the pair, saying: ‘Opening batsmen are supposed to face the new ball when it’s doing a little bit. If you can’t play that, you’re in the wrong job.’ Michael Vaughan criticised the footwork and mindset of England's top order for just looking to survive. Jonathan Trott was out for a duck on his return to the Test match side in Antigua. Alastair Cook was clean bowled by Kemar Roach for 11 as England struggled on the first morning. Former fast bowler Bob Willis said: ‘England’s top three looked constipated and need a good dose of syrup of figs.’ West Indies’ early success after putting England into bat appeared at that stage to make a mockery of the comment by Colin Graves, the new England and Wales Cricket Board chairman, who labelled the opposition ‘mediocre’.

Article: Dani Alves posted a picture of himself with his trousers down on his Instagram account on Thursday. With one message coming out of the player’s camp and a very different one emerging from the Nou Camp it’s difficult to know who feels they have been left exposed by who. We take a look at the contract wrangle and ask: could he really end up at Manchester United? Dani Alves, out of contract at the end of the campaign, is pictured training for Barcelona on Friday. His contract runs out on June 30 why has it come to this? Barcelona had never planned to keep Alves beyond this season. He’s served them brilliantly but he will be 32 next month and on  £85,000-a-week he is one of their top earning defenders along with Gerard Pique. What they were not counting on is their own incompetence in finding a replacement for him and the FIFA transfer ban that stops them buying anyone this summer. So now they want him to stay? They do, but very much on their terms. The club are letting it be known they have offered him a two-year deal with an option of a third year depending on the number of games played in the second year. Alves’ camp say it’s actually a one-year deal to be renewed for a second year, and then a third year, only if he plays a certain number of matches. The new contract also comes with incentives. If he wins things then he will end up earning the same money but his basic earnings before bonuses would drop. Barcelona defender Alves has been sounded out by Manchester United over a move to Old Trafford. And there are other clubs who will gladly take him? After weeks of rumours that the suitors were queuing around the Nou Camp to sign him up it now seems that one big club has offered him a three-year deal with none of the strings, sub-clauses and trap-doors as the Barca deal. And that club is Manchester United? United are the prime suspects with PSG out of the running. But Alves' camp say now is not the time to name the club. You sound doubtful…. Only in as much as if Manchester United had really offered him a three-year deal would he still be haggling with Barcelona? Surely a Premier League swansong at Old Trafford is the perfect way to round off what has been a remarkable career with the Spanish giants – winning four leagues, three cups and two Champions League titles. Perhaps he just really wants to stay in Barcelona? The children he has with ex-wife Dinorah Santa Ana (who is now his agent) live in the city and after 13 years in Spain he is reluctant to leave. He is hoping Barcelona, desperate because they can't sign players, make him a better offer. Dinorah Santa Ana, Alves ex-wife and now his agent, addressed the media earlier this week. But if he does end up at United will he be a success? It’s easy to look at the gold shoes, the denim waistcoats and the polka dot ties and just see an eccentric extrovert who plays football in his part-time. That does a tremendous injustice to easily the most gifted and successful right-back of his generation. He remains super-fit and if there is slightly less energy to get up and down the pitch as there once was perhaps that wouldn’t be a bad thing – Louis van Gaal is hardly going to want him flying forward Barcelona style at every possibility. He remains very watchable and has a tenacity and speed of recovery that means he never has been the defensive liability some have depicted. The Brazil international is hopeful Barcelona make him an improved offer so he can stay at the Nou Camp. You make it sound as though Barcelona would be foolish to let him leave... In view of the fact that if they allow him to walk away they will end up having to play Douglas at right back then that may well be the case. The strange summer signing from Sao Paolo who cost £4m and has started one game looks completely out of his depth. Put it this way – the manager Luis Enrique wants Alves to stay.

Article: A daredevil climber known as the ‘French Spiderman’ has scaled the world’s tallest twisted skyscraper – without a safety harness. French climber Alain Robert climbed Dubai's 1,007ft Cayan Tower with nothing more than sticky tape and chalk, which he kept in a pouch clipped to his waist, for assistance. Hundreds of spectators looked on as the 52-year-old free-climber scaled the 75-storey tower that has a twist of 90 degrees. Alain Robert climbed the tower with nothing more than sticky tape and chalk, which he kept in a pouch clipped to his waist. The 52-year-old has previously suffered falls during his attempts to climb buildings across the world. Robert, who has suffered numerous falls during previous climbs, took an hour and a half to scale the high-rise building in the United Arab Emirates. The climb was captured on video and shows the daredevil ascending at 8.25pm without a harness while struggling to find space for his feet on the narrow ledges. A spotlight follows his progress as spectators below look up and film the stunt on their camera phones and Robert makes his way over a hanging ledge. The French daredevil set off at 8.25pm and the climb took him an hour and a half to complete. Hundreds of spectators looked on as the 52-year-old free-climber scaled the 75-storey tower. At one point Robert stands from the building and waves a flag in homage to real estate developers, Cayan Group, who gave him permission to climb the tower. Previously Robert has been arrested, imprisoned and banned from locations across the world including London's Shard for illegal ascent. The climbing feat is not the first to be achieved by the French Spiderman in Dubai. Robert has previously been arrested, imprisoned and banned from locations across the world for illegal ascent. Sense of scale: A spotlight follows the daredevil's progression as he makes his way up the buidling. In 2011, Robert scaled the world’s tallest tower, the Burj Khalifa, which stands at 2,717ft, in just over six hours. The daredevil used a rope and a harness on this occasion however, in compliance with regulations set by the organiser.

Article: (CNN)Mark Ronson's "Uptown Funk!," featuring Bruno Mars, is the longest-leading Billboard Hot 100 of the 2010s, ruling the chart for a 13th week. It's also just the 10th single in the Hot 100's entire history to spend at least 13 weeks at No. 1. Plus, newcomer Natalie La Rose reaches the top 10 with her debut hit "Somebody," featuring Jeremih. As we do each Wednesday, let's run down all the songs in the top 10, and a bit beyond, on the sales/airplay/streaming-based Hot 100 (dated April 11). "Funk," released on RCA Records, passes Robin Thicke's "Blurred Lines," featuring T.I. and Pharrell to take sole possession of the Hot 100's longest command this decade. Here's an updated look at the hits to lead for the most weeks since the beginning of 2010:. Weeks at No. 1, Title, Artist, Date Reached No. 1. 13 (to date), "Uptown Funk!," Ronson feat. Mars, Jan. 17, 2015. 12, "Blurred Lines," Robin Thicke feat. T.I. + Pharrell, June 22, 2013. 10, "Happy," Pharrell Williams, March 8, 2014. 10, "We Found Love," Rihanna feat. Calvin Harris, Nov. 12, 2011. "Funk" also becomes one of an elite 10 singles ever to top the Hot 100 for at least 13 weeks, dating to the chart's Aug. 4, 1958 launch:. Weeks at No. 1, Title, Artist, Date Reached No. 1. 16, "One Sweet Day," Mariah Carey & Boyz II Men, Dec. 2, 1995. 14, "I Gotta Feeling," The Black Eyed Peas, July 11, 2009. 14, "We Belong Together," Mariah Carey, June 4, 2005. 14, "Candle in the Wind 1997"/"Something About the Way You Look Tonight," Elton John, Oct. 11, 1997. 14, "Macarena (Bayside Boys Mix)," Los Del Rio, Aug. 3, 1996. 14, "I'll Make Love to You," Boyz II Men, Aug. 27, 1994. 14, "I Will Always Love You," Whitney Houston, Nov. 28, 1992. 13 (to date), "Uptown Funk!," Ronson feat. Mars, Jan. 17, 2015. 13, "The Boy Is Mine," Brandy & Monica, June 6, 1998. 13, "End of the Road," Boyz II Men, Aug. 15, 1992. Ask Billboard: Will 'Uptown Funk!' be the Hot 100's No. 1 Song of 2015? With "Funk" now just three weeks from potentially tying "One Sweet Day" for the record, and four weeks from possibly claiming it all to itself, can it rewrite Hot 100 history? It's too early to forecast charts a month away, but "Funk" still sports strong leads in all main Hot 100 metrics. "Funk" logs a 13th week atop the Digital Songs chart with 165,000 downloads sold (down 12 percent) in the week ending March 29, according to Nielsen Music.  That's a record-tying feat: "Funk!" matches Flo Rida's 2007-08 hit "Low," featuring T-Pain, for the most weeks a title has spent at No. 1 on Digital Songs. "Funk" also leads Streaming Songs (16.2 million U.S. streams, down 15 percent) for an 11th week. On Radio Songs, "Funk" reigns for a 10th week with 166 million in all-format audience (down 4 percent). It's the first song to reach double-digit weeks at No. 1 on Radio Songs since "Blurred Lines" led for 11. Ask Billboard: Will 'Uptown Funk!' Be the Hot 100's No. 1 Song of 2015? "Funk," thus, leads the Hot 100 and its three main component charts (Digital Songs, Radio Songs and Streaming Songs) simultaneously for a record-extending ninth week (nonconsecutively). Perhaps helping the chances that "Funk" can remain at No. 1 on the Hot 100, at least for another week: while it's down by 11 percent in overall activity, the No. 2 song (for a third week), Maroon 5's "Sugar," decreases by 3 percent, while Ed Sheeran's "Thinking Out Loud," at No. 3 (for a third week, after peaking at No. 2 for eight weeks), is off by 2 percent. And, the lead of "Funk" over those songs is still significant: they each boast approximately two-thirds of the Hot 100 points of "Funk" this week. Could either "Sugar" or "Loud" rebound to challenge "Funk" further on the Hot 100? Could another song in the top 10 topple it? Or, is it a song just building, or not even yet released, that will take over? Again, it's too soon to tell. We know only that a song will eventually dethrone the uncommonly overarching smash that "Funk" has become. (At least we think one will...) Chart Highlights: Taylor Swift's 'Style' hits No. 1 on adult pop songs. Meanwhile, "Sugar" takes over at No. 1 on the subscription services-based On-Demand Songs chart, despite a 10 percent drop to 4.1 million streams. ("Funk" falls to No. 3 on the list after 11 weeks at No. 1.) "Sugar" holds at No. 2 on Digital Songs (143,000, down 8 percent); rises 4-2 on Radio Songs (133 million, up 3 percent); and keeps at No. 4 on Streaming Songs (9.5 million, down 4 percent). Below Sheeran, Ellie Goulding's "Love Me Like You Do" holds at No. 4 on the Hot 100 after reaching No. 3. The Fifty Shades of Grey soundtrack single dips 3-4 on Digital Songs (114,000, down 14 percent) and stays at No. 5 on Radio Songs (118 million, up 8 percent) and Streaming Songs (9 million, up 9 percent). From the same hit movie, The Weeknd's "Earned It (Fifty Shades of Grey)" reaches the Hot 100's top five (6-5), adding top Airplay Gainer honors for a second week. On Radio Songs, it pushes 9-6 with a 23 percent gain to 86 million. "Earned" (a possible contender for No. 1 on the Hot 100...) holds at No. 6 on both Streaming Songs (8.9 million, up 24 percent) and Digital Songs (107,000, up 4 percent). The sultry track also takes over at No. 1 on Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Chart Highlights: Taylor Swift's 'Style' Hits No. 1 on Adult Pop Songs. Fetty Wap's "Trap Queen" rises 8-6 on the Hot 100, while spending a second week at No. 1 on Hot Rap Songs; Taylor Swift's "Style" ranks at No. 7 on the Hot 100 for a third week after reaching No. 6 (and, as previously reported, reaches No. 1 on the Adult Pop Songs airplay chart); Rihanna, Kanye West and Paul McCartney's "FourFiveSeconds" drops 5-8 on the Hot 100 after climbing to No. 4 (and departs the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs summit after seven weeks); and Flo Rida climbs 10-9 with "G.D.F.R.," featuring Sage the Gemini and Lookas. The rapper's new EP, My House, arrives Tuesday (April 7). One song is new to the Hot 100's top 10: La Rose's "Somebody," featuring Jeremih (13-10). The Dutch singer's debut hit lifts 10-8 on Radio Songs (73 million, up 9 percent); backtracks 13-14 on Digital Songs, but with a 7 percent gain to 68,000; and zooms 31-19 on Streaming Songs (4.3 million, up 5 percent). The track tops the Rhythmic Songs airplay chart for a second week. (Jeremih scores his fourth Hot 100 top 10, and first in a featured role.) La Rose is adjacent to her friend, and mentor, Flo Rida, on the Hot 100. After she had introduced herself to him at a party, they soon began working together, and she started touring with him. They created "Somebody," based on Whitney Houston's 1987 Hot 100 No. 1 "I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)," as La Rose is a "huge fan of '80s music," as she told Billboard. She's currently recording her debut EP. Just beyond the Hot 100's top 10, Walk the Moon's "Shut Up and Dance" pushes 15-12, and is the new No. 1 on the Hot Rock Songs chart, while Jason Derulo's "Want to Want Me" bounds 27-17. And, Rihanna roars in at No. 23 with "B**** Better Have My Money," the chart's highest debut, powered largely by its No. 5 debut on Digital Songs (108,000 sold since its digital retail arrival on March 26). More details on action below the top 10 in the weekly "Hot 100 Chart Moves" column to post on Friday (April 3). See the original story at Billboard.com. ©2015 Billboard. All Rights Reserved.

Article: Louis van Gaal believes Manchester United will hit the ground running in their attempt to win the Barclays Premier League next season after persuading the Old Trafford hierarchy to agree to a short and sharp pre-season tour of America in July. After last summer’s mammoth trek across the United States, an angry United manager Van Gaal vowed that it would never happen again on his watch and believes to this day that the effects of the pre-season schedule cost his side dearly when the real action started. Now Sportsmail can reveal that Van Gaal and United have turned down offers from Asia and Australia and are about to sign off a visit to America – in all likelihood to the west coast. The trip will last in the region of 12 days – a whole week shorter than last summer - and will be over by August 1. Manchester United beat Real Madrid in Michigan last summer in front of 109,000 fans. United played four games in America last pre-season, here Wayne Rooney scores against LA Galaxy. United beat Liverpool in the final to win the International Champions Cup last summer. While rivals such as Manchester City are trekking around Australia, Van Gaal and his United players will operate out of one base in America and travel to their games from there. The club have agreed once again to rake part in the International Champions Cup that they won last summer by beating Liverpool in a final in Miami. The tournament is played all over America but this time the promoters have essentially allowed United to choose their own venues as they are so desperate to have England’s most famous club in it. Details of the competition were supposed to be announced last week with United given a provisional deadline to commit to their schedule by last Friday. However, the announcement has been put on hold while Van Gaal and United tweak final details. Last season, Van Gaal joined United after the World Cup in Brazil to find the club committed to a two-and-half week marathon comprising visits to Los Angeles, Pasadena, Denver, Washington, Detroit and, finally, Miami. Rooney scored another spectacular goal for United against Aston Villa last weekend. Following their tour of America, United suffered a slow start but are now firing on all cylinders in the league. The Dutch veteran was furious at the itinerary that he felt asked too much of his players as they were constantly asked to fly in to different time zones and even play at altitude in Colorado. Having to then play the final in Florida during a thunderstorm was the final straw. For long periods of this winter’s negotiations, Van Gaal and United seemed set to commit to a schedule on America’s East Coast. It is understand, however, that Van Gaal has recently performed a volte face and expressed a preference for the more agreeable climates of the west. Van Gaal has insisted this time that his team will travel to match venues from one base and will have no repeat of the arduous treks endured to games in Pasadena and Ann Arbor last year. One possible base is the Seattle Seahawks training camp on America’s north-west coast. The Premier League season starts early this year, with the competition kicking off on August 8.

Article: Arsenal are trying to find a cure for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's persistent groin problems in a bid to prevent surgery. Arsene Wenger revealed the attacking midfielder has suffered a setback in his bid to return from a hamstring strain that has sidelined him since the FA Cup win over Manchester United on March 9. However, it is the recurrence of a long-standing groin problem that has caused the delay in Chamberlain's return to action, not the hamstring. Arsenal are trying to find a cure for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain’s persistent groin problems. Oxlade-Chamberlain has been struggling with an ongoing groin problem for several months. The groin injury has been an ongoing problem for the England international for several months, but he, together with the club's medical staff, have managed it throughout the season. The root cause of the complaint remains unclear, with club doctors trying to establish a permanent cure for the problem. Arsenal are keen to surgery and are exploring other treatment methods to rid the former Southampton man of his groin discomfort. However, the option of an operation isn't being ruled out, though any procedure would only take place in the summer. Arsene Wenger has revealed the attacking midfielder has suffered a setback in his bid to return to fitness. The 21-year-old should play again this season but the fear is that the problem could recur. Oxlade-Chamberlain will miss at least two more weeks, meaning he will not be available for next weekend's FA Cup semi-final against Reading. The 21-year-old should play again this season, but the fear is that the problem could recur. Surgery would mean another busy summer for Oxlade-Chamberlain as he'd be required to complete a rehabilitation programme before pre-season. He was involved in Roy Hodgson's World Cup squad last year, but didn't feature owing to a knee injury. Fitness permitting, Oxlade-Chamberlain is also likely to be part of Hodgson's squad for Euro 2016 at the end of next season. Arsenal are close to signing 16-year-old Maxi Romero from Velez Sarsfield for £4.5million. 'It is taking a bit longer than I thought because he has a groin inflammation,' confirmed Wenger. 'I hope it does not become a long-term problem but he faces a hurdle this week in training. 'We will see if he has recovered, so the end of the week and the start of next week are important to see if he got rid of that inflammation. Meanwhile, Arsenal's chief negotiator Dick Law has flown to Argentina in an attempt to rubber-stamp the £4.5million capture of 16-year-old forward Maxi Romero from Velez Sarsfield. The deal has been held up by third-party ownership issues - and Law has travelled to South America to resolve the problem.

Article: Cristiano Ronaldo looked in formidable form as he showed off his array of skills ahead of Real Madrid's Champions League quarter-final against city rivals Atletico. The World Player of the Year pulled off a selection of back-heels and fancy flicks during Monday's training session, wowing forward partner Karim Benzema and sending Luka Modric to the floor. Real looked in good spirits after a successful weekend, during which they cut the gap to La Liga leaders Barcelona to just two points, and the European Champions were further boosted by the return from injury of Wales winger Gareth Bale.

Portuguese defender Pepe claimed the success in the league will give Real a boost ahead of Tuesday's first leg, a repeat of last year's Champions League final. 'The two point [gap] gives us a lift,' he told AS ahead of the game. 'We will fight until the end, because that's just what we did to win La Decima. 'We must play against [Atletico Madrid] with intensity and humility, which is how we are playing now and how we did before the international break. We have to learn from our mistakes.' The Ballon d'Or winner keeps the ball away from James Rodriguez during a drill in Real Madrid training. Carlo Ancelotti is likely to call on his forward trio of Ronaldo, Benzema and Gareth Bale against Atletico. Bale missed out on Saturday's win over Eibar with an injury, but was back in training on Monday. Ronaldo jokes with compatriot Pepe as the Real Madrid stars looked to be enjoying themselves in training. Ronaldo controls the ball as Modric topples over backwards after doing the splits during the session. The two Madrid sides have already met six times this season, with Real yet to record a victory, losing both league matches, and twice being defeated on aggregate in cup competitions. However, Real are seven points clear of their rivals in the La Liga table, and will be confident ahead of their trip to the Vicente Calderon. Real will hope Bale, Benzema and Ronaldo can help reverse their shocking run against their rivals this year. James Rodriguez and Pepe are put through their paces as Real prepared for Tuesday's crucial showdown. Sergio Ramos hugs Fabio Coentrao as their team-mates watch on during Monday's session in Madrid.

Article: (CNN)A high temperature of 63.5 degrees Fahrenheit might sound like a pleasant day in early spring -- unless you're in Antarctica. The chilly continent recorded the temperature (15.5 degrees Celsius) on March 24, possibly the highest ever recorded on Antarctica, according to the Weather Underground. The temperature was recorded at Argentina's Esperanza Base on the northern tip of the Antarctica Peninsula, according to CNN affiliate WTNH. (Note to map lovers: The Argentine base is not geographically part of the South American continent.) The World Meteorological Organization, a specialized United Nations agency, is in the process of setting up an international ad-hoc committee of about 10 blue-ribbon climatologists and meteorologists to begin collecting relevant evidence, said Randy Cerveny, the agency's lead rapporteur of weather and climate extremes and Arizona State University professor of geographical sciences. The committee will examine the equipment used to measure the temperature, whether it was in good working order, whether the correct monitoring procedures were followed, whether the equipment was placed in the correct location and whether the measurement is matched by corresponding records from surrounding stations, Cerveny said. The committee will discuss the issues and make a recommendation to Cerveny, who will make an official finding, probably by late summer or early fall. Researchers who study climate change carefully watch weather changes in the Antarctic region and elsewhere for evidence that the Earth is getting warmer.

The veteran striker has been forced to settle for a bit-part role at Stamford Bridge this season after the summer arrivals of Diego Costa and Loic Remy. And he admits he finds sitting on the bench frustrating, saying: 'It's difficult when you don't play and then have to go into these kind of games. But I try to give my best. 'I tried to give the best of my physical capacity against QPR, so if the manager needs me I'm ready.' Despite his lack of action, Drogba looks certain to pick up his fourth Premier League title this season.

They are maybe thinking about us and hoping we make a bad result. But we are more positive that we want to win. 'You want to feel that it's comfortable at the top, but when you look at the game against QPR, you know the gap can be closed easily within a game or two.

Article: Conor O’Shea has revealed his concern at the increasing force of rugby’s collisions after Harlequins and England full back Mike Brown was consigned to even more time on the sidelines to recover from the latest high-profile head injury. Brown has not played since the final round of the RBS 6 Nations on March 21, is still suffering headaches after a week-long holiday in Dubai and no closer to being declared symptom-free. The episode raises questions about whether the 29-year-old was brought back too early for England’s title-decider against France, having been knocked out in the Test against Italy five weeks earlier following a crunching collision with Andrea Masi. Mike Brown is knocked out in a collision with Italy’s Andrea Masi in the Six Nations last month. Brown was out cold for approximately eight minutes and hasn't played since the Italy game on March 21st. ‘It’s a concern because I don’t like someone coming in with something you can’t diagnose,’ said O’Shea, Quins’ director of rugby. ‘Sometimes a physio will sit you down and say, “It’s six to 12 weeks out”. Here it could be tomorrow or it could be whenever — we don’t have a timescale. There’s no doubt that a decade or even a year ago Browny would be back out on the pitch. ‘You want to see the gladiatorial side of things — the big hits that we’ve all grown up with. It was once a badge of honour that you got up and got on with it. But at least we’re now aware. Is it a concern for the game that we’re seeing collisions of the nature that we are? Yes, it has to be.’ Brown will have played just six of his club’s last 19 games after sitting out of the coming weekend, and his England team-mates Joe Marler and Chris Robshaw have featured in only eight of the last 18. Northampton have ruled out George North, who is suffering from his own concussion problems after being knocked out in three different collisions, until the end of the month and O’Shea must also deal with the absence of one of his marquee players. George North suffered his third concussion in four months during Northampton's defeat to Wasps. ‘You can look at a succession of events for George North, whereas this is a follow-on of symptoms from one event,’ said O’Shea. ‘Against Italy it was as big a hit as I’ve seen someone take. It was quite frankly a monstrous hit. I was pretty worried when I saw it live. ‘Is it tough on us having the England full back for six out of 19 games and still indeterminate? Yes, but there are more important things than rugby.’

Article: Luis Suarez is quickly establishing himself in Barcelona folklore after impressing since his £75million move from Liverpool and the striker has revealed that years prior, he found himself sneaking into the Nou Camp. Speaking to Spanish radio station COPE, the forward spoke candidly about Real Madrid's interest in signing him and opened up about the infamous bite on Giorgio Chiellini during the World Cup. Suarez revealed that during a visit to his future club, he sneaked into the Nou Camp with his wife Sofia for a photo opportunity. Luis Suarez (9) has revealed that he once sneaked his way into the Nou Camp for a photograph. He said: 'It was not the first time that I came to Barcelona, it was the second. I went past the official store and saw it, but I did not go in because I didn't have money to buy anything. 'I was already going with Sofía and I remember that I saw an open door and I told her: 'Let's go'. 'You're crazy'. 'Come, just one photo'. 'No, no'. 'Yes, yes, yes. I'm going to go in'. I went in through the door that was open, she followed me and we started to run. 'We stood on the stairs and took a photo with all of the stadium behind us. I still haven't found the photo. Then we ran, and we were nervous. It was the only time that I had entered. My father-in-law managed to enter another time to see Argentina-Catalunya, on December 27.' The Uruguayan lit up the 'El Clasico' last month, where he scored the winner to send his side top of La Liga but he could have been playing for the opposition, if he'd not decided to move to Catalonia. The Uruguayan has been in fine form for Barcelona following his move and is becoming a fan's favourite. The forward admitted that Real Madrid were'very' interested in signing him but he only wanted Barca. Talk of a move to the Spanish capital had been rife during his years at Liverpool but Suarez revealed that there was only one club which caught his eye. He said: 'Madrid were very interested in me, but my dream was always Barcelona. When I heard the name of Barca, I did not hesitate at any moment.' Arguably Suarez's most famous, yet controversial moment, when he bit Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil and being banned for four-months. 'The bite on Chiellini was the worst moment of my career,' he said. 'I let myself down, my country, my wife and my children. The bites were partly my fault and partly [due to] the provocation of Ivanovic and Chiellini. Now they continue provoking me, but now I go or speak well. I am more intelligent.' Suarez admits that the bite was the worst moment of his career as he received a four-month playing ban. The attackers bite Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini during the 2014 World Cup group game last July.

Article: (CNN)The United States has seemingly erupted this week about what it means to live your religion, especially in Indiana, where its new Religious Freedom Restoration Act faces a firestorm from critics who say it uses faith as a pretext to discriminate against gay people. Such state laws have been growing ever since the U.S. Religious Freedom Restoration Act became law in 1993, designed to prohibit the federal government from "substantially burdening" a person's exercise of religion. So far, 20 states have some version of the religious liberty law, and the legal controversies have grown, too. Nonetheless, claims under those state RFRAs are "exceedingly rare," and victories involved mostly religious minorities, not Christian denominations, experts say. "There is reason to doubt whether these state-level religious liberty provisions truly provide meaningful protections for religious believers," wrote Wayne State University law professor Christopher Lund in a 2010 analysis, when there were only 16 states with such laws. Here are some of the more interesting cases arising from the federal and state laws, touching upon an array of religious matters from a knife carried by an IRS accountant to a tea from the Amazon:. He was a Native American with eagle feathers at a religious gathering of tribes. But not in the eyes of the feds. In 2006, Robert Soto and Michael Russell attended an American Indian powwow while in possession of eagle feathers, in violation of the federal Eagle Protection Act, which outlaws the killing of bald and golden eagles and even picking their feathers off the ground. Soto, a Lipan Apache, asserted he was participating in an Indian religious ceremony. The feathers are sacred to Native Americans. But a federal Fish and Wildlife Service agent found his tribe wasn't federally recognized, and Soto surrendered his feathers. Russell, who is married to Soto's sister, isn't American Indian and agreed to pay a fine, according to court papers and the America Bar Association Journal. Soto, however, petitioned the federal Interior Department to return his feathers. The feds said no, because he wasn't from a recognized tribe. Soto and Russell sued the federal government, but a federal district court ruled in favor of the government, rejecting the two men's First Amendment assertions and their claims under the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the same 1993 statute that Indiana legislators used in developing their new state law. But last August, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the trial court's decision and sent the case back to that court after finding the government's action would violate the federal RFRA. On March 10, the federal government returned the eagle feathers to Soto. But the legal war isn't over. The federal government still maintains it can criminally prosecute Soto and his congregants, so Soto is seeking a preliminary injunction, claiming the feds are violating the federal RFRA, said Luke Goodrich, Soto's attorney who's with the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty. A tea used by a Brazilian faith is to them like wine used by Catholics at communion, but U.S. agents considered the brew an illegal drug. The religious organization O Centro Espirita Beneficiente Uniao do Vegetal uses a sacramental tea called hoasca, made from two plants native to the Amazon that contains dimethyltryptamine, a hallucinogen, in violation of the Controlled Substances Act. The religion is a Christian spiritist faith that originated in Brazil and includes Amazonian and indigenous spiritual traditions. About 140 members of the church live in the United States and use the tea in a sacred communion. In May 1999, U.S. Customs agents entered the church headquarters in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and seized all of its hoasca. The church became alarmed and cited how the federal government allows an exception for American Indians to use another illegal drug, peyote, in their religious ceremonies. In fact, the federal RFRA was designed partly to protect the Native Americans' use of peyote, said CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. "They were a legitimate religion, and this was a legitimate ritual of the religion, and Congress wanted to make sure it was protected," Toobin said of peyote and the 1993 law. The Uniao do Vegetal, which means "the union of the plants," cited that federal law in suing the federal government. "The government has never explained why it has accommodated The Native American Church's use of peyote (which contains mescaline, also a controlled substance) but cannot accommodate the UDV's use of hoasca," the church said in a statement. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the church's favor, saying the federal government failed to show a compelling interest to ban the substance for religious use. "The peyote exception also fatally undermines the government's broader contention that the Controlled Substances Act establishes a closed regulatory system that admits of no exceptions under RFRA," the court ruling said. Bruce Rich, an Orthodox Jewish prisoner in Florida, wanted kosher meals, but the warden said no. So Rich sued the state prison system in 2010, saying its denial of a kosher menu violated the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000, a landmark civil law rights law for inmates whose predecessor was the federal religious freedom law. Rich, 66, is serving a life sentence for murdering his parents, in their 70s, in 1995 allegedly to inherit their home. The prison system argued the meals were costly and would lead to security concerns, namely "retaliation against the kosher inmates" if other inmates believed the higher costs of kosher meals impacted the quality of their food, court papers said. At least 35 other states and the federal government, however, provided kosher diets to inmates. After losing before a magistrate, Rich won an appeal before the 11th Circuit Court, which cited "the defendant's meager efforts to explain why Florida's prisons are so different from the penal institutions that now provide kosher meals such that the plans adopted by those other institutions would not work in Florida." Recently baptized in the Sikh faith, Kawal Tagore went to her job with the IRS in Houston in 2005 carrying a new religious item: a 9-inch kirpan, a small ceremonial sword that resembles a knife but has an edge that is blunted or curved. Tagore needed to carry the kirpan at all times as a mandatory article of faith. But the federal government banned her from the building, citing the kirpan as a "dangerous weapon" with a more than 3-inch blade, and she was later fired from her accounting job because she refused to keep the kirpan out of the workplace. Tagore sued the government under the federal law. Tagore cited how the government allowed the public to enter the federal building with more threatening objects: real 2.5-inch blade knives and metal canes, said her attorneys with the Newar Law Firm and the Becket Fund. Also, federal employees inside the building were allowed to use box cutters and cake knives. In November, the federal government agreed to settle the case shortly after the start of Tagore's trial. The settlement included no admission of wrongdoing, the Christian Science Monitor reported. Tagore's attorneys described the settlement as "a groundbreaking policy allowing Sikhs and other religious minorities to wear religious symbols and attire in federal buildings," they said in a statement. Invoking a religious freedom law and related statutes doesn't always equate to victory. In Chicago, an association of 40 churches called the Civil Liberties for Urban Believers found it too onerous to erect houses of worship in business and commercial zones. The ministers needed a special use permit, but such permits were often thwarted by aldermen or it was too bureaucratic and costly to obtain one, the church leaders claimed. In fact, it was easier to get a club, lodge or community center approved. So the pastors sued the city of Chicago in 2000, alleging that its zoning laws violated the Illinois religious freedom statute, the federal Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act and the U.S. Constitution. But in 2003, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court decision and rejected the church group's claims, finding no substantial burden on the churches, which also failed to establish their RLUIPA claim. Defeated, church leaders were angry. "The forty (40) churches in C.L.U.B. and certainly people of all faiths throughout Chicago are outraged by the majority opinion which neuters the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act passed unanimously by Congress in 2000," Apostle Theodore Wilkinson, the group's chairman, said in a statement. "Also alarming is the court's conclusion that Chicago's religious assemblies have no free speech protection from zoning laws. The majority opinion would apparently extend free speech protection to religious assemblies only if they allowed live nude dancing," he said. At the same time, the city of Chicago revised its zoning ordinance to avoid "the threat of heightened scrutiny under RLUIPA," according to a League of California Cities report in 2002.

Article: Gary Hooper came off the bench to snatch a dramatic stoppage-time winner to keep Norwich City on track for automatic promotion in the Sky Bet Championship after Neil Lennon's battling Bolton came within minutes of gaining a point. Former Celtic star Hooper's goal sparked jubilant scenes on the Canaries bench in contrast to the dejection of his one-time Parkhead boss Neil Lennon. Indeed, Hooper had been a transfer target for Lennon earlier in the season so his winning goal was a double blow for the Ulsterman. Gary Hooper celebrates after earning Norwich three points with a stoppage-time winner against Bolton. Former Celtic striker Hooper is mobbed by his team-mates as Norwich remained second in the Championship. Bolton: Bogdan, Vela, Dervite, Ream, Moxey, Bannan, Walker (Janko 87), Feeney, Gudjohnsen (Danns 82), Heskey, Le Fondre. Subs not used: Lonergan, M Davies, Trotter, Rochinha, McCarthy. Booked: Walker, Moxey. Scorer(s): Le Fondre. Norwich: Ruddy; Whittaker (R Bennett 71), Martin, Bassong, Olsson, Tettey, Howson, Dorrans, Hoolahan (Grabban 57), Redmond (Hooper 66), Jerome. Subs not used: Rudd, E Bennett, O'Neil, Odjidja-Ofoe. Booked: Bennett. Scorer(s): Dorrans 9, Hooper 90+. Referee: James Adcock. Graham Dorrans gave the Canaries an early lead as his right-footed free-kick deflected off Josh Vela into the net, but Adam Le Fondre looked to have rescued a point and extended Bolton's unbeaten run to four games. Instead, Hooper lobbed keeper Adam Bogdan - as the Wanderers defenders switched off - to score an invaluable goal. Lennon had promised his side would spoil a few parties in the remaining games of the season with Brantford and Bournemouth coming up in the next few weeks. That looked to be the case until Hooper's strike made it five wins in the last six meetings between the teams. Norwich made the perfect start with Dorrans' deflected free-kick after Vela took down Nathan Redmond on the edge of the area. The Canaries should have doubled their advantage six minutes later as Sebastien Bassong rose highest at a corner but cleared Bogdan's crossbar by some distance. Hooper lobs the ball over Adam Bogdan to spark jubilant scenes on the Canaries bench. Former West Brom midfielder Graham DOrrans celebrates after giving the visitors the lead on Saturday. And the visitors were in total control when Wanderers drew level totally against the run of play. It was so one-sided manager Lennon was poised to bring on Neil Danns to shore up his midfield. Instead, youngster Tom Walker, who had been guilty of delaying a cross moments earlier, learned his lesson. His flashing centre from the left picked out Le Fondre inside the six-yard box and the on-loan Cardiff City striker, back in the side after missing the Easter Monday trip to South Wales, finished with ease. Walker continued to prove a threat to the visitors' defence with his elusive running and was harshly booked for a foul on Wes Hoolahan. Liam Feeney shot narrowly wide from another Walker cross that fizzed beyond three static Norwich defenders before the Canaries rediscovered their composure. Top scorer Cameron Jerome, whose double won the reverse fixture at Carrow Road last October, brought a smart save out of Bogdan while the Hungarian international needed treatment after punching away another dangerous-looking Dorrans free-kick. Norwich striker Cameron Jerome heads towards goal during the clash at the Macron Stadium. The second half was much more competitive and Wanderers were more of a match for their high flying visitors. So much so that Neil brought on Lewis Grabban after 57 minutes for Hoolahan. And Grabban made an immediate impact, bringing out a save from Bogdan before Tim Ream cleared off the line from first-half scorer Dorrans. However, Bolton had their moments going forward too with Le Fondre trying cheekily to chip John Ruddy while Alex Tettey cleared off the line after Dorian Dervite narrowly failed to connect with Walker's corner. Neil's intention's were clear and with 20 minutes left had made his full set of substitutions with Hooper replacing Nathan Redmond and Steven Whittaker going off for Ryan Bennett. The visitors were incensed they did not get a penalty when Russell Martin's cross hit Dean Moxey on the hand. But any ill luck was cancelled out in injury time as hot shot Hooper slotted his winner.

Norwich beat Bolton 2-1 at the Macron Stadium in the Championship. Graham Dorrans gave the visitors the lead inside 10 minutes. Adam Le Fondre drew Neil Lennon's side level after 18. Gary Hooper won the game for Norwich in the closing moments. Norwich remain second ahead of Watford on goal difference.

Article: A pensioner will stand trial for allegedly making a racist gesture at a football match, with three black players expected to give evidence. Ernest Goult, 72, is accused of making the gesture at a Middlesbrough home game against Blackburn in the Championship in November. Blackburn players Markus Olsson, Rudy Gestede and Lee Williamson are expected to give evidence at the trial about the alleged incident at the Riverside Stadium. Pensioner Ernest Goult arrives at court, where he will stand trial for allegedly making a racist gesture. Teesside Magistrates' Court heard a police officer would also be giving evidence and the prosecution would produce CCTV footage. Goult, wearing a suit and pink shirt, spoke to confirm his name and deny the charge. The home team had been leading the game 1-0 until Gestede scored a controversial equaliser deep into stoppage time. Rudy Gestede celebrates his stoppage-time goal that levelled the game, which was played in November. At the time the police said the alleged gesture took place as the Blackburn players applauded their own fans. Goult, from Redcar, who has no previous convictions, was granted unconditional bail and the case will return to the magistrates' court in June. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Article: Atlanta (CNN)Robert Lewis Burns Jr., the original drummer in Southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd, died Friday night in a car crash, a Georgia State Patrol spokesman said. Burns, 64, died after his car hit a mailbox and a tree in Cartersville, spokesman James Tallent said. No other cars were involved in the crash, which occurred shortly before midnight. "He was not restrained at the time of the crash," Tallent told CNN. The musician lived in northern Georgia. Burns was part of the genre-defining band's original lineup, which formed in Jacksonville, Florida, in 1965. Lead singer Ronnie Van Zant started Noble Five with Burns, guitarists Gary Rossington and Allen Collins and bassist Larry Junstrom in their hometown. It then made a name change in a reference to a high school gym teacher. Lynyrd Skynyrd changed members over the years as it produced rock anthems including "Sweet Home Alabama" and "Freebird." Burns left the band before its third studio album, "Nuthin Fancy," in 1975, "exhausted by touring," according to the band's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame biography. He was not involved in the 1977 plane crash that killed three members, including Van Zant. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006. Lynyrd Skynyrd still tours with Rossington, the only original member still in the band. "Today I'm at a loss for words but I just remember Bob being a funny guy," Rossington said on the band's official Facebook page. "My heart goes out to his family and God bless him and them in this sad time. He was a great great drummer." People we've lost in 2015.

Article: Wisden, the cricket bible, has launched a stinging attack on English cricket and says that the national team have lost touch with the game's public. Editor Lawrence Booth, also a respected cricket writer with Sportsmail, uses his notes to take England to task after a tumultuous year spent trying to recover from the bitter fall-out of losing the last Ashes series 5-0. English cricket, says Booth in the 152nd edition of the fabled Almanack, which is published on Wednesday,'repeatedly lost touch with the basic idea that the national team belongs to us all'. Wisden editor Lawrence Booth has launched a stinging attack on the ECB's handling of Kevin Pietersen. The star batsman will ply his trade for Surrey in a bid to reclaim his spot in the England Test team. And he continues: 'A few wins might have deflected attention from a charge sheet that would include the mishandling of the Kevin Pietersen affair, worrying Test attendances outside London, a head in the sand attitude to the one-day team and - not yet a decade after the 2005 Ashes had presented English cricket with a golden chance to attract a new generation to the sport – a fall in the number of recreational players. 'Starting with the drubbing in Australia, England lost eight full series out of all across the formats in 2014, to say nothing of their defeat by the Netherlands at the World Twenty20. In all, they lost 28 games. Only once had this been surpassed in a calendar year by one of the eight major teams – the dysfunctional 2010 Pakistanis. 'National selector James Whitaker had called Cook "our exceptional leader"; Paul Downton, the ECB's new managing director, hailed Peter Moores as the "outstanding coach of his generation". It was a nexus of self-preservation yet, as the wagons circled, the wheels kept threatening to fall off.' The Wisden editor is just as scathing about England's decision to sack Alastair Cook as one-day captain on the drink of what turned out to be the most disastrous World Cup in England's history. Peter Moores presided over a disastrous World Cup but was labelled 'the outstanding coach of his generation' by the ECB's new managing director Paul Downton. The beleaguered Alastair Cook was stripped of the one-day captaincy before the World Cup debacle. 'To leave the sacking of Cook so late made little sense,' says Booth. 'Had he stepped down in August after the 3-1 Test win over India he could have done so with his post-Ashes reputation partly restored. This would have allowed him to gather strength for the ludicrous run of 17 Tests in less than 10 months, starting in Great Optimism in Antigua in April 2015 and ending in Near Exhaustion in South Africa in January 2016. (As someone pointed out, 17 Tests are almost a third of Don Bradman's career.) 'Trouble was, Cook had become more than just a cricketer: cast by his employers in the role of latter-day saint to Pietersen's fallen angel, he was now an article of faith. Giles Clarke (the ECB chairman) even suggested the Cooks were "very much the sort of people we want the England captain and his family to be" which was all well and good but couldn't stop him edging behind. Downton, Whitaker and Moores were all bound up with his fate. Cook had to succeed, as much for others as himself. It was an intolerable position. 'England overplayed their hand. The Test win over a supine India did not mean Cook would effect a similar transformation of the one-day side. This seemed obvious to everyone – except to the men who run the game.' But Booth, who also writes for Sportsmail, says Cook's eventual sacking so late made little sense. National selector James Whitaker (right) had called Cook 'our exceptional leader' Pietersen appeared on the Graham Norton Show - the presenter suggested 'team sport's not for you' England also come under attack for the way they handled the sacking of Pietersen, a situation where they had right on their side - plus the support of the bulk of those who follow the team around professionally - but somehow allowed the maverick to claim the morale high ground. A situation that, incredibly, is still going on, after Wisden went to press on this year's edition. 'The ECB's comments on the fall-out with Pietersen should have been clear and concise,' writes Booth. 'If you're widely regarded as a pain it helps if you're scoring lots more runs than anyone else. Instead, England botched the PR battle. They hinted that some darker truth about his behaviour would emerge once a confidentiality agreement expired in October. Yet the lull merely prolonged the fiasco. And, when the dirt failed to materialise, the ECB looked rudderless. Worse, in the eyes of those agitating for an explanation, they looked indifferent. 'It was typical of a story beyond ECB's control that their best moment was not of their own making. Having searched in vain for the words that justified his sacking, they were gifted a 324-page solution, an autobiography so full of rancour that BBC chat-show host Graham Norton suggested to Pietersen: "Maybe, just maybe, team sport's not for you." This year's Wisden also includes both a withering review of Pietersen's nasty book by the Mail on Sunday's Patrick Collins, who retired this year after a distinguished career, and an excellent piece of the aspect of his career totally overlooked by Pietersen in his book – batting that touched genius. Simon Hughes admirably fills the void that Pietersen left himself. Gary Ballance has been named one of Wisden's five cricketers of the year in the new edition. Ballance's Yorkshire team-mate Adam Lyth, called up by England, is also in the top five. Jeetan Patel (left) and Angelo Mathews make up the remainder of Booth's top five cricketers. Sri Lanka's brilliant Kumar Sangakkara clinched the title of leading cricketer in the world. Australia's Meg Lanning (batting against England) is honoured with the inaugural women's award. The thousands of disciples of Wisden always look immediately at who the editor has chosen as his five cricketers of the year, one of the oldest and most highly regarded prizes in sport. Booth has chosen well and predictably in the cases of Moeen Ali, who has the honour of being pictured on the front cover, Gary Ballance, Adam Lyth and Angelo Mathews and enterprisingly in Jeetan Patel, who is rewarded for his prolific season for Warwickshire. To me, the award suffers in that players are only allowed to be picked once. For instance, how good would it be if, on his retirement, a player would be described as a five-time Wisden cricketer of the year? Booth is a progressive, brilliant, imaginative editor but perhaps such a move would be just a little too controversial for such a traditional vehicle as Wisden. The brilliant Kumar Sangakkara, who will be delighting championship audiences with Surrey this summer, is the leading cricketer in the world while, for the first time, there is an international woman cricketer of the year. Australia's Meg Lanning is honoured with the inaugural women's award. As ever, Wisden is a must for any cricket fan and even at a time of continuing turmoil for the England team and genuine concerns about cricket's future world-wise, it is a reassuring presence however critical the editor is of it. Moeen Ali (England and Worcestershire) England’s search for a spin bowler to replace Graeme Swann was thought to be doomed – until Moeen Ali lit up the summer with 12 wickets in the Southampton and Manchester Tests against India. He finished the series with 19 at 23 apiece. Earlier in the season he had almost saved the Headingley Test against Sri Lanka, batting for all bar one ball of the final day. And, when he was promoted to open for the one-day side, he scored the third-fastest hundred by an England batsman, from 72 balls against Sri Lanka in Colombo. Moeen Ali celebrates taking the wicket of India's Cheteshwar Pujara at Old Trafford last summer. Gary Ballance (England and Yorkshire) Gary Ballance began the summer with a century in his first home Test, against Sri Lanka at Lord’s, and followed up with two more against India – at Lord’s and Southampton. By the end of the season he boasted a Test average of over 60. Gary Ballance celebrates reaching his century during the third test with India in Southampton last year. Adam Lyth (England and Yorkshire) Yorkshire opening batsman Adam Lyth was the leading run-scorer in the County Championship, with 1,489 runs at an average of 67 and six hundreds, and was one of the pillars of his team’s triumph. He was rewarded with a place on England’s tour of the Caribbean in April 2015. Yorkshire's Adam Lyth was the leading run-scorer in the 2014 County Championship season. Angelo Mathews (Sri Lanka) Angelo Mathews was the inspiration behind Sri Lanka’s first Test series victory in England. After helping to save the First Test at Lord’s with a century, he made 160 – and took four wickets – as Sri Lanka came from behind to win in Leeds. Mathews also led his team to wins in the one-day series and the one-off Twenty20 international. Angelo Mathews after making 160 for Sri Lanka in the second Test with England at Headingley. Jeetan Patel (New Zealand and Warwickshire) New Zealand off-spinner Jeetan Patel was central to Warwickshire’s success across all three formats. He claimed 107 victims in total, more than anyone in the country, and his 25 wickets in the NatWest T20 Blast – the most in the competition – helped his side lift the trophy on home turf at Edgbaston. Jeetan Patel takes the final wicket as Warwickshire beat Middlesex in last year's County Championship.

Article: Seoul, South Korea (CNN)The man accused of stabbing U.S. Ambassador Mark Lippert in Seoul last month is now charged with attempted murder, a South Korean court official said Wednesday. Kim Ki-Jong has also been charged with assaulting a foreign envoy and business obstruction, the Seoul Central District Court official said. According to South Korean law, Kim's trial must begin within 14 days of receiving today's indictment. Lippert was stabbed March 5 during an event organized by the Korean Council for Reconciliation and Cooperation, which advocates peaceful reunification between North and South Korea. Shortly before Lippert was supposed to give a speech, the attacker slashed him in the face and jaw. The ambassador suffered a gash from his right cheekbone to his lower jaw that required 80 stitches. That wound measured 10 centimeters (4 inches) long and 2.5 centimeters (1 inch) deep, but there was no serious facial nerve damage, said Dr. Jung Nam-shik of the Yonsei Severance Hospital. Lippert also suffered five cuts in his left arm and hand, but was not expected to have permanent damage to his arm function. Police said Kim stabbed Lippert with a 10-inch knife because he opposed the joint South Korean-U.S. military drills, which happen every year and frequently draw the ire of North Korea. Police official Yoon Myeong-seong told reporters that Kim had visited North Korea seven times between 1999 and 2007, and that authorities were investigating a possible connection between his visits to the reclusive state and the attack against Lippert. Kim, 55, has a history of unpredictable behavior. In 2010, he received a suspended two-year prison sentence for throwing a piece of concrete at a Japanese ambassador to South Korea, according to the Yonhap news agency. South Korean President Park Geun-hye condemned the attack. "This incident is not only a physical attack on the U.S. ambassador," she said, "but an attack on the South Korea-U.S. alliance and it can never be tolerated." CNN's Madison Park and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.

Article: Chelsea captain John Terry has revealed his picks for the PFA Player and Team of the Year with Liverpool playmaker Philippe Coutinho getting his nod as the Premier League's finest. Although the former England captain has not been on the losing side to Liverpool in three games this season, Terry has obviously been impressed by the young Brazilian's skills - despite him only scoring four league goals. Less surprising is Terry's choice of Tottenham scoring sensation Harry Kane as Young Player of the Year- with the 21-year-old's rise from obscurity to scoring 19 league goals for Spurs making him almost certain to  take home the award. Chelsea captain John Terry revealed his PFA Team of the Year on Instagram. The Blues legend named Phillipe Coutinho as his Player of the Year and Harry Kane as his Young Player. Liverpool's Brazilian playmaker, scoring the winner in the FA Cup, has hit form in second half of the season. Keeper: David de Gea. Defenders: Ryan Bertrand, Jose Fonte, Laurent Koscielny, Nathanial Clyne. Midfielders: Philippe Coutinho, Raheem Sterling, Juan Mata, Sadio mane. Strikers: Harry Kane, Sergio Aguero. As a defender, Terry has acknowledged Southampton's miserly record this season by including no less than three of their backline - Jose Fonte, Nathaniel Clyne and former Chelsea full-back Ryan Bertrand who left Stamford Bridge for St Mary's in the summer. Manchester United's outstanding keeper David de Gea and Arsenal centre-back Laurent Koscielny complete Terry's defence. In midfield, Coutinho is joined by Raheem Sterling, Sadio Mane and another player former Blue Juan Mata who has endured a difficult time under Louis van Gaal before making his mark at Old Trafford. Despite not finding the net in his last five league games, Sergio Aguero takes his place alongside Kane in Terry's attack in a classic 'big man/small man' combination. Kane has scored 19 league goals, although he was mistakenly named best player by Youssouf Mulumbu. Former Chelsea stars Juan Mata (left) and Ryan Bertrand (right) were also named in Terry's XI. Meanwhile, West Brom midfielder Youssouf Mulumbu was left red-faced after posting his own PFA Team of the Year selections on Twitter - only to realise he had got his Players of the Year mixed up. The Baggies star had named Kane as Player of the Year and Chelsea's Eden Hazard as Young Player of the Year before later realising his mistake and tweeting:  ‘I get it wrong Hazard player of the year And young player Kane!!’

Article: Has this brilliant 79th Masters got one final twist to reveal come the final round on Sunday? No-one would be surprised following the dramatic events of the third round, when the three biggest names in the sport combined with Justin Rose to throw the veritable kitchen sink at the cool 21 year old Texan Jordan Spieth. The young American coped so adeptly he gave up just one shot of his five stroke halfway lead and will partner Rose in the final round armed with a useful advantage. But there was just enough vulnerability shown in his finish to offer encouragement not only to Rose but Masters specialist Phil Mickelson, who will start five behind. Spieth is the third player his age to take a healthy lead into the final round. It worked out perfectly for Tiger Woods in 1997 but not so well for Rory McIlroy in 2011, who collapsed under the pressure over the final nine holes. ‘I think Jordan will cope better than I did because he was in the final group last year,’ said McIlroy. ‘I certainly expect him to cope a lot better than I did.’ Jordan Spieth carded a double bogey on the 17th but still set a new 54-hole scoring record at the Masters. At 16 under par, Spieth broke the record shared by Ray Floyd and Tiger Woods by a single shot. The other thing Spieth has in his favour is that this is the fourth tournament in a row when he has been in the final group in the final round. He won one and finished runner-up in the other two. If he wins, he will go to number two in the world and the rivalry with Rory that might dominate golf for the next decade will have begun. Spieth looked to have taken the tournament beyond everyone else when he went seven strokes clear with just two holes to play. But while Rose finished off with a staggering fifth birdie in his last six holes, Spieth was running up his first double bogey of the tournament at the 17th. And at the last there was a horrible fanned approach that threatened to trim the lead to just three, before Spieth conjured up a remarkable up and down to give him momentum heading into what promises to be another momentous Masters Sunday. Plucky journeyman Charley Hoffman lies fourth while Woods and McIlroy both shot 68 to be tied fifth and will play together on Sunday. But at ten shots off the pace they are surely too far behind. As for Rose, the 2013 US Open champion has given himself the chance of seizing another major following his astonishing finish. Pick of the quintet of birdies came at the par three 16th, where he holed a spectacular bunker shot. ‘I think it’s important to be in the final group, it’s where you want to be,’ said the 34 year old Englishman. ‘Jordan is obviously playing some very special golf but I have definitely given myself an opportunity.’ World No 1 Rory McIlroy and 14-time major winner Tiger Woods were in a five-way tie for fifth. Finally, the real McIlroy showed upon the par fives at Augusta on Saturday. What a day we had on Saturday. It was as if Rose and the big three in terms of charisma had come up with an unspoken pact and declared: ‘Ok, let’s see if this kid Jordan is really destined for greatness.’ For those who thought the runaway halfway leader had merely to turn up to claim the green jacket, we had McIlroy playing like the world number one and Tiger confounding the sceptics with a bravura display that made you feel the last 12 months had all been a bad dream. There was the glorious sight of Mickelson playing once more like he owns Augusta. And then there was Rose, who has had a lot of good days at Augusta in his ten Masters tournaments and now was enjoying one more. How would you like to see all that taking place in your rear view mirror, at this of all courses? In short, for five simply incredible hours the roars were echoing all over this sacred property and for most of that time they were funnelling in Spieth’s direction. This was undoubtedly as severe an examination as you could imagine for a third round. Just as well, then, that the creed that has served him so well already during his phenomenal 18 months as a professional just happens to be: ’Whenever the heat is on, ensure you focus just that little bit more.’ And that, for the most part, is just what he did. Only at the end did he look like stumbling, but that fabulous up and down at the last kept everything upbeat. Tiger Woods put on a vintage show, he was astonishing, electric, inspired and charismatic. Woods' girlfriend Lindsey Vonn showed her support during the third round on Saturday. The previous 54 hole standard of 15 under was set by Ray Floyd in 1976 and Woods in 1997. But the youngest first round leader in Masters history and the man who set a new low mark for 36 holes on Friday had reached 16 under after a 70. What made this so impressive was that, for the first time, a few errors crept into his previously immaculate game. During the round he would have three three putts and his first double. When things like this happen here it’s so easy for the mind to unravel but Spieth kept his composure. At the par five second that peerless putting stroke rapped home another birdie putt and one more at the sixth. At the treacherous 9th he seemed to have left himself a difficult second shot, from a downhill lie to an elevated green. Spieth knocked his approach to 6ft and holed that one as well to turn in 35 shots. In its own way, this was the equal of his spectacular bouts of scoring in the first two rounds. So it continued. The two stringent par fours to start the back nine were safely negotiated before his tee shot to the par three 12th came down 8ft from the flag. You can guess what happened next, and he birdied the 13th as well. He would threeputt the 14th, however – and then came the next test. Phil Mickelson played like the Masters specialist to finish the third round on 11 under. Justin Rose reeled off five birdies in the last six holes to move into second place on 12 under. As he made his way down the 15th fairway, first Mickelson and then Rose made amazing birdies at the 16th to send the crowd into raptures. How would he respond? Well, at the 15th he calmly stroked a four iron into the middle of the green for a two putt birdie. Best of all was the eight iron he struck to 8ft at the 16th for yet another birdie. McIlroy, Woods and Mickelson all shot sumptuous front nines of 32 shots. Mickelson was wearing a salmon pink shirt in honour of Arnold Palmer. Some of his great attacking play had been delivered wearing just such a colour and Mickelson was doing justice to the memory. Eight strokes off the pace at the start of play, he’s still in the ball game but will need another magic-filled round today. Add McIlroy’s wonderful back nine 31 from Friday afternoon to his front nine 32 yesterday, and you would have a round that equalled the course record of 63. Amazing how the switch flipped for him at the halfway point in the second round. So tentative to that point and perhaps a touch nervous with all that was at stake, it was as if he looked at a leaderboard that showed him 17 shots off the lead and a stroke outside the projected halfway cut and decided: ‘To hell with it, let’s go for it.’ Finally, the real McIlroy showed up on the par fives, those scoring holes that have given him such problems in recent years. An eagle at the 13th on Friday was followed by an eagle on the second in his third round. He was off and running. He birdied the long 8th plus the 13th and 15th for his best-ever return on the par fives during a single round at the Masters. A poor eight iron to the 16th cost him, however, as a 6ft par putt was dribbled miserably. Another bogey at the last as well meant a 68. And so the likely list of winners stands at just three – Spieth, Rose and Mickelson. It should be some final day. It has been some tournament.

Jordan Spieth set a Masters record 54-hole total of 16-under-par. The American carding a 70 to take a four-shot lead into the final round. Justin Rose collected five birdies on his final six holes to go 12 under. Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods were among those at six under after 68s.

Article: (CNN)When Hong Kong police answered a call in the early hours of a Saturday morning last November, they encountered a grisly scene and an alleged crime that shocked the city. One woman was lying on the floor with cuts to her neck and buttocks. Another was stuffed inside a suitcase on the balcony. A former banker, 29-year-old Briton Rurik Jutting, was charged with two counts of murder. On Thursday, a court hearing that was to determine whether there was enough evidence to proceed to trial was adjourned until May. Here's what we know so far about the victims and their alleged attacker. Jutting allegedly lived at the murder scene, an upmarket apartment in the middle of Wan Chai, an inner-city suburb that's home to an eclectic mix of late-night bars, residential tower blocks and local markets selling groceries and assorted cheap goods. In the early hours of Saturday morning, November 1, police say Jutting called them to the apartment.  There they found a woman lying on the blood-splattered floor, later identified as 29-year-old Seneng Mujiasih. During a search of the apartment, officers uncovered another body hidden in a suitcase on the balcony. It's alleged 25-year-old Sumarti Ningsih was killed on October 27, five days before her body was found. Sumarti Ningsih was from Cilacap, in Central Java, and was the mother of a five-year-old girl. In a statement, her cousin, Jumiati, described her as  "just an ordinary woman from Indonesia" who, like many others, was "forced to work abroad to feed her poor family and make her dream comes (sic) true." "She wanted to work as professional so she can earn money and dignity for her family," Jumiati wrote. "She is good girl and did not deserve this treatment." According to the Asian Migrant Coordinating Body, Ningsih was visiting Hong Kong as a tourist and had been due to fly back to Jakarta the day after her body was found. Last year, her grieving father, Ahmad Khaliman, told Agence France-Presse that his daughter had worked in Hong Kong as a domestic helper between 2011 and 2013. She'd since returned on two occasions, Khaliman said. He said the family had been shocked by her murder, and called for the perpetrator to be executed. "If not, I cannot accept it. He has already taken my daughter's life, so he has to pay with his life," he told CNN affiliate Trans7. Seneng Mujiasih had more recently worked as a domestic worker in Hong Kong but had overstayed her visa, according to the Asian Migrant Co-ordinating Body. Also known as Jesse Lorena, Mujiasih was from the city of Muna in Sulawesi province, in southeast Indonesia. Other than that, few details are known about her life and why she stayed on in Hong Kong. After news of their death spread, fellow domestic workers held a vigil in Hong Kong's Victoria Park. Around 200 people gathered to sing and pray, and lay flowers besides photos of the two women. The victims' bodies were buried after being repatriated to Indonesia in November. Before being taken into custody, Rurik Jutting lived in the upmarket J Residence in Wan Chai.  He was detained at the scene, where police found the bodies of two women and seized a knife during a search of the premises. It's unclear when Jutting left his job as a trader at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch; a BoA spokesman would only confirm that a man of the same name had worked there in the past. Jutting's profile on LinkedIn said he haad been employed at the bank's structured equity finance and trading division in Hong Kong since July 2013. Before that, he worked in the same unit in London for three years. According to the profile, Jutting previously worked in capital markets for the British bank Barclays and studied history and law at the prestigious University of Cambridge, between 2004 and 2008. As part of the trial process, tests were conducted to determined if Jutting was psychologically fit to enter a plea. He was. The case was then adjourned to allow for more than 200 pieces of forensic and DNA evidence to be analyzed.

Article: Struggling Hamburg have appointed Bruno Labbadia as their new coach with immediate effect in a surprise decision with the former European champions anchored in last place with six matches left. Despite widespread speculation about a pending deal with former Mainz coach Thomas Tuchel, Hamburg said they had agreed on a 15-month contract with Labbadia, who had coached them in 2009-10. The coach's contract is also valid for the second division should Hamburg be relegated. He takes over from interim coach Peter Knaebel who replaced sacked Joe Zinnbauer in March and will now return to his post as sports director. Hamburg have appointed Bruno Labbadia as their new coach on a 15-month contract. 'We decided to take this step because we consider the coach question the most important,' said Hamburg CEO Dietmar Beiersdorfer in a statement. 'With Bruno Labbadia we now have a strong coach who is also experienced in relegation battles.' Beiersdorfer said the club had ended talks with Tuchel after an agreement could not be reached. Hamburg are the only club with a perfect Bundesliga record, having played every season in the top division since the league's creation in 1963. Labbadia returns to Hamburg for a second spell after coaching the club for one season in 2009-10. The 49-year-old Labbadia, a former Hamburg player, has also coached Bayer Leverkusen and VfB Stuttgart among other. 'We have no time to waste,' Labbadia said. 'Every point matters for us and I am happy that Hamburg has such support from the fans. Because we have to be a unit until the last matchday.'

Article: Bayern Munich's treble ambitions are put to the test on Wednesday in the German Cup quarter-final when their injury-hit side travel to in-form Bayer Leverkusen. The Bavarians, runaway leaders in the Bundesliga and through to the Champions League last eight where they face Porto later this month, are eager to repeat their 2013 treble-winning campaign as the season enters its final stretch. A 1-0 league victory at Borussia Dortmund on Saturday despite a string of absences was crucial to boost their confidence ahead of the Cup game, goalkeeper Manuel Neuer said. Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer celebrates after the 1-0 win against Borussia Dortmund on Saturday. Neuer made a spectacular in injury time from a Marco Reus free kick to ensure the three points. 'The 1-0 victory was a very good sign for us,' Neuer, who made a spectacular save in stoppage time to protect their slim lead, said. 'We have to try to carry this momentum to our game at Leverkusen.' Bayern were without wingers Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben as well as David Alaba, who tore a knee ligament and will be out for about two months. They were also missing defender Holger Badstuber, forcing coach Pep Guardiola to overhaul his team and play a new-look midfield with captain Philipp Lahm, Xabi Alonso and Bastian Schweinsteiger. 'I would have liked to have played differently but I have to adapt the system to my players,' said Guardiola. Neuer advances from his line to beat Reus to the ball during the clash at Signal Iduna Park. Manager Pep Guardiola is having to content with a number of injuries ahead of the German Cup quarter-final. Guardiola, in his second season in charge after winning the domestic double last year, will have the chance to slightly alter his system again with midfielder Thiago Alcantara making a comeback on Saturday after more than a year out injured. The addition of the skilled Spain international is undoubtedly a major asset ahead of Leverkusen, who crushed Hamburg SV 4-0 in their league game on Saturday. Ribery could also be back in time for Wednesday's game, providing Guardiola with more punching power. Leverkusen, eager to remain in the top four to secure yet another Champions League campaign next season, have won their last five Bundesliga games without conceding a goal as they hit top form. Former Barcelona midfielder Thiago Alcantara made his first appearance for a year against Dortmund. 'We want to advance but we know it will be hard,' Leverkusen's Gonzalo Castro said. 'We know what we can do and we can play with confidence. Our counter attacks are extremely fast and good. After our 4-0 win and five straight victories our confidence is very high.' In another all-Bundesliga clash Borussia Dortmund, finalists last season, take on Hoffenheim on Tuesday eager to edge closer to the final and a possible European spot after a dismal league showing this season. VfL Wolfsburg face Freiburg and Borussia Moenchengladbach take on third-tier Arminia Bielefeld in the other two quarter-finals.

Bayern Munich won 1-0 in Dortmund in the Bundesliga on Saturday. A Bundesliga, Cahmpions League and German Cup treble is on for Bayern. Pep Guardiola's side face Bayer Leverkusen in the Cup quarter-final. Manuel Neuer looking for Bayern to build momentum in cup on Wednesday.

Article: Fergal O'Brien is daring to dream what might be at Aintree on Saturday as he insists last year's fourth Alvarado is going into the race in better shape this time around. The 10-year-old gelding has run only once this season, finishing fifth at Doncaster in February. But Limerick-born O'Brien, 42, believes that is preferable a preferable situation to 12 months ago when Alvarado went into the race not having run since pulling up at Cheltenham on New Year's Day. Fergal O'Brien says that Alvarado is in better shape going into this weekend's Grand National at Aintree. That is showing in his contender's demeanour of Paul Moloney's at home, O'Brien said. The trainer added: 'I think we are in a better position. He is very straightforward in that if he is eating well and you can get him in the field he is pretty well in himself. 'I actually think we are a bit further on than we were last year.' O'Brien spent 18 years working for trainer Nigel Twiston-Davies, 16 of them as Head Lad. During that time, he helped prepare two National winners in Earth Summit and Bindaree but, with duties back at base, last year was the first time he had ever been at Aintree on National day. Alvarado, pictured here at Cheltenham in 2013, has run only once this season back in February at Doncaster. O'Brien added: 'I said all along if Alvarado jumped the first couple of fences and enjoyed it he would run well. He has an awful lot of ability, although you don't always get it from him. He is not ungenuine but because he is quirky.' Gary Moore-trained 2014 Champion Chase winner Sire De Grugy runs over two and a half miles for the first time on Friday when he heads the 10 runners in the Melling Chase. Josh Moore rides in place of injured brother Jamie. Sire De Grugy jumps a fence on his way to victory in the Champion Chase at Cheltenham last year.

Article: Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers vowed not to give up on Champions League qualification after a convincing 2-0 win over Newcastle. The Reds moved within four points of the Barclays Premier League top four after goals from Raheem Sterling and Joe Allen saw off the struggling Magpies at Anfield. With fading champions Manchester City now looking vulnerable in fourth, Liverpool's hopes - which took a hefty blow in back-to-back losses to Manchester United and Arsenal - could have been reignited. Raheem Sterling wheels away in celebration after scoring Liverpool's opener. Rodgers said: 'The players and myself are very motivated to do the best we can. We have shown we can put results together consistently. We have important players coming back which is good news. 'But we are looking for other teams to slip up and we have to continue winning. 'There are teams above us but, as we have seen last year, there can be changes and points dropped and I think there will be changes.' Sterling curls the ball in to the far corner of Tim Krul's net to give Liverpool the lead. Liverpool, inspired by Philippe Coutinho, started superbly with Sterling scoring after nine minutes and several other chances being created. Newcastle rallied before the break and had a strong penalty appeal turned down but Allen made the game safe in the second half. Rodgers said: 'It was a good performance. I thought that our attacking play was very bright, we looked exciting going forward, we worked hard in the midfield. Sterling's shot nestles in to the back of the net as Krul picks himself up from Anfield turf. 'At times our possession could have been better but we had a real attacking intent and created chances and could have scored more goals.' The defeat was Newcastle's fifth in succession and left them with work still to do to ensure they do not get pulled into the relegation battle. Their misery was compounded when Moussa Sissoko was sent off for what was deemed a second yellow card offence, when he caught Lucas Leiva on the ankle. Manager John Carver admitted Sissoko could easily have been shown a straight red, however. Allen secured three points for Liverpool that narrowed the gap on Manchester City. He said: 'The sending off, it could have been a straight red, I will be honest. I have said that to Moussa, I am quite straight and I won't defend anyone if it is indefensible.' Asked if Sissoko could be fined, Carver said: 'I am sure there will be some kind of disciplinary procedure. I said before the game we needed to keep 11 players.' While Carver did not complain about that decision, he was angry that Ayoze Perez did not earn a penalty after apparently being felled by Dejan Lovren. He said: 'The game hinged on a huge decision. I don't want to be seen to be a moaner but it is fact we don't get big decisions for whatever reasons, it could be me. I have spoken to the referee, but it doesn't help me.' Lovren clears the ball with his head as Lucas and Perez also scrap for the ball. Carver did see reason for some optimism, feeling that his side's performance was much improved from their derby loss to Sunderland last time out. He said: 'I thought the first nine minutes we were very tentative, nervous after our performance against Sunderland. It was a bad goal to concede. 'After that we grew into the game. It is easy to crumble at Anfield but we didn't. One or two guys rolled their sleeves up. 'I think we got a response. We didn't get a result but I saw enough. 'There are lot of positives to take from the game. A lot of people expected us to get a hiding and I think we held our own for the majority of the game.'

Article: Arsenal have been here before. Manchester City sniffing around with their millions, looking to prize away some of Arsene Wenger's finest talent. Jack Wilshere is the latest man linked with a switch to the Etihad Stadium, where he would follow the likes of Emmanuel Adebayor, Bacary Sagna and Samir Nasri who swapped London for the North-West as City stormed towards Premier League and FA Cup glory. But times have changed. The Gunners are now ahead of City in the table and appear to be a club on the up, while the men from Manchester must rebuild. And if £30million or more is truly on the table for Wilshere, Arsenal must consider it. Manchester CIty are considering making a move for Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere this summer. Wilshere hasn't played for the first team since injuring his ankle against Manchester United in November. Alexis Sanchez cost Arsenal £30m, while Chelsea splashed out roughly the same amount to bring in Diego Costa. Those two forwards have a combined total of 33 league goals this season. And for all Wilshere's many talents, he would not be a game changer for Manuel Pellegrini, or whoever City's manager may be next season. He was touted as a future Arsenal and England midfielder when he burst onto the scene, showing the world what he can do in a Champions League tie against Barcelona, and possesses a technical ability which wouldn't see him out of place at the Nou Camp. His quick movement, superb touch and low centre of gravity is perfect for the sharp, driving style of play manager Wenger likes at the Emirates Stadium, as Wilshere's goal of the season against Norwich last season perfectly demonstrated. He has been doubted on several occasions, partly because of his lifestyle off the pitch, in the most part because of his treacherous injury record at the age of 23. The midfielder has picked up a total of 24 knocks during his seven-year professional career. He was tipped as a future Arsenal star and England international when he broke through the ranks in 2008. Wilshere is only 23 years old but has picked up 24 separate injuries during his professional career. But even as recently as this season, Wilshere was hitting form before going off against Manchester United. He was certainly more impressive than Aaron Ramsey and Santi Cazorla in the Arsenal midfield, and impressed for England in a deep-lying role. There now seems to be little space for the Stevenage-born schemer to fit in this starting XI. Ramsey, Cazorla, Sanchez, Francis Coquelin, and Mesut Ozil played behind Olivier Giroud in the recent thumping victory over Liverpool, and that's without the likes of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Tomas Rosicky, Theo Walcott and Danny Welbeck involved. Of course, the ideal state of play would be for Wenger to build a team around Wilshere, a man who is signed on for three more years, and not to consider any bids from divisional rivals at least. But Arsenal would be foolish to dismiss anything over £30m in today's market, especially considering the kind of players Wenger can now attract to the club. Wilshere impressed in a holding role for England in an international friendly against Scotland last year. He was in form before ankle surgery, scoring a fine goal against Manchester City in September. The midfielder fired past Brad Guzan to score the opening goal against Aston Villa last season. Wilshere's effort against Norwich was voted the 2013-14 Premier League Goal of the Season. Arsenal's relationship with City, who the club have never held a firm rivalry with, could also play a part. Any interest from fellow top-four clubs Chelsea or Manchester United would probably be dismissed immediately. The current Premier League champions are looking to rebuild under Sheik Mansour and need homegrown, young players to freshen up an ageing side. Wilshere is seen as a possibility along with Jordan Henderson in midfield. Raheem Sterling and Paul Pogba have also been linked with a summer transfer, with Nasri and Yaya Toure among many names who could leave. But with Liverpool set to hand Henderson the captain's armband after Steven Gerrard's departure, his stay would seem more likely despite his contract running down at Anfield. Arsenal fans would hate to see Wilshere go and he encapsulates the style at the Emirates. However, for a man who has scored five goals in his league career, and one who would not neccessarily push on close rivals to better things, it may be worth thinking about. Jordan Henderson is also a possibility for Manchester City as the club look for homegrown youngsters.

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence.
Manchester City considering bid for Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere. Jordan Henderson is also an option for the Premier League champions. Wilshere, 23, encapsulates Arsene Wenger's style of play in north London. But the England international is not necessarily a first-team regular. Any bids in excess of £30m should be considered by Arsenal.

Article: (CNN)Imprisoned soldier Chelsea Manning can now communicate with the world  -- in 140 characters or less. Manning, who is serving a 35-year prison sentence for leaking thousands of classified documents, appears to have joined Twitter this week. In a series of tweets, the prisoner formerly known as Bradley Manning said she will be using a voice phone to dictate her tweets to  communications firm Fitzgibbon Media, which will post them on her behalf. She is not allowed Internet access in prison, according to The Guardian. "It will be hard, but I don't want this Twitter feed to be a one-way street/conversation," Manning posted to her nearly 26,000-plus followers. Manning was sentenced in 2013, and in August of that year, she said she wanted to transition to a female. The Fort Leavenworth Disciplinary Barracks in Kansas, where she is serving her sentence, has authorized hormone therapy for her treatment. Manning said she suffers from gender dysphoria. Her  lawyers describe it as "the medical diagnosis given to individuals whose gender identity -- their innate sense of being male or female -- differs from the sex they were assigned at birth, causing clinically significant distress." Last year, a Kansas judge granted her request to be formally known as Chelsea Elizabeth Manning. The former Army intelligence analyst was convicted of stealing and disseminating 750,000 pages of documents and videos to WikiLeaks in what has been described as the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history. She was found guilty of 20 of the 22 charges, including violations of the U.S. Espionage Act. Manning has written opinion pieces for The New York Times and The Guardian from prison.

Article: American Airlines is tapping into the youth market with the introduction of their new in-flight music. New indie music was first piped into the cabin - during boarding and disembarking - a few months ago and has quickly become a hit with passengers. In fact, many have taken to Twitter to share their approval of the new on board playlists, which feature rockers such as The xx, Haim, Phantogram and Hozier. American Airlines is targeting a younger demographic with the introduction of their new 'indie' cabin playlists. According to BuzzFeed News, on an internal blog, American Airlines representative, Barbara Delollis, discussed the company's decision. 'For 2015, they sought out a style of music that's upbeat yet not distracting, helps American stand out from the competition and appeals to younger generations,' she wrote. And it takes a lot for a track to make the cut. According to Delollis, the songs aren't just those 'you might find on the iPad/Spotify of a Gen Xer or Millenial. Foster The People is just one of many indie rock bands that are included on American Airlines' new playlists. Tracks from Hozier (left) and Lykke Li (right) were also hand selected to be played on board the flights. While boarding and while disembarking, specially selected indie rock music will now be piped into the cabin. The change comes on the heels of unfavourable customer feedback about the airline's previous cabin music, which were instrumental piano versions of pop songs. Brian Richardson, senior manager of American's in-flight entertainment and connectivity, also shared his thoughts about the switch on the same internal blog. 'The instrumental versions of pop songs had become tired and people were ready for a change,' he added. One Twitter user was especially excited to hear one of her favourite bands, Phantogram, on board. Washed Out, or Ernest Greene, is an electronica singer-songwriter and record producer from Georgia. Hozier's Take Me to Church was one of the biggest songs of the year - and can now be heard on board. Phantogram (left) and The xx (right) are two of the featured artists on American Airlines new cabin playlists. One customer mused that boarding his American Airlines flight felt like heading into a trendy nightclub. For this Twitter user, the best part of his flight was the boarding music playlist - and arriving safely, of course. Some passengers aren't totally excited about the change, like this man, who liked the previous elevator music. He also shared his excitement about seeing customers on board take out their smartphones and use the Shazam app to identify the songs playing. 'Who would've thought that we'd be introducing some people to these indie artists?' he wrote. The indie music is paired with the airline's new state-of-the-art cabins and, so far, all mainline and some regional aircraft have adopted the in-flight playlists. MailOnline Travel has contacted American Airlines for comment.

New on board playlists include rockers such as The xx, Haim and Hozier. Unfavourable customer feedback about previous music prompted switch. So far, all mainline and some regional aircraft have adopted the change.

Article: Arsenal midfielder Santi Cazorla is among a number of players to have offered support to Villarreal defender Mateo Musacchio following his gruesome leg injury. The Argentinian fractured his fibula and dislocated his left ankle during his side's 1-1 draw at Getafe in the Primera Division on Sunday. The 24-year-old underwent successful surgery hours later in Madrid. Villarreal's Mateo Musacchio runs for the ball near the touchline with 13 minutes left to play. As he closes in on the ball and the sliding opponent, his right foot is bent back, breaking his ankle. Musacchio crumples to the ground in agony after the horrendous ankle break. No recovery time has been set by the club but Musacchio is expected to be sidelined for at least six months. Cazorla, who played with Musacchio during his time at Villarreal, tweeted: 'A lot of best wishes to my friend Mateo, I hope it's not too serious. 'Wishing you all the strength for the recovery.' Villarreal's Argentinian striker Luciano Vietto also tweeted: 'We share your pain and sadness, we will be supporting you all the way. 'A lot of strength Mateo!!!' The Spanish Footballers' Association (AFE) said in a statement: 'All the strength in the world to Mateo. Santi Cazorla played with Musacchio for Villarreal before joining Arsenal, tweeted support for the defender. Cazorla wrote: 'A lot of best wishes to my friend Mateo, I hope it's not too serious' 'We will await your return to the pitch as soon as possible with the rest of your Villarreal team-mates.' Musacchio, who joined Villarreal from River Plate in 2009, has been limited to just 12 La Liga starts this season because of injuries. The South American recovered from a torn hamstring back in January. 'I would have traded losing by a big margin than seeing Mateo getting injured this way,' Villarreal coach Marcelino said on his club's official website. 'It's a difficult time for everyone. 'It's a very serious injury and it's a real misfortune. 'I didn't think Mateo's injury would be as serious as it is but when I approached the stretcher and I saw that there was so much blood, I got frightened. 'We hope we can all help him in his recovery. 'It's a sad time for us.' Musacchio joins Villarreal captain Bruno Soriano on the sidelines, who is out of action until May with a knee injury sustained earlier this year.

Article: (CNN)President Barack Obama tied himself to the mast of a nuclear deal with Iran even before he became the Democratic candidate for president. Reaching a good, solid agreement with Iran is a worthy, desirable goal. But the process has unfolded under the destructive influence of political considerations, weakening America's hand and strengthening Iran. Obama's political standing and his historic legacy in foreign policy are so deeply intertwined with reaching an accord with Iran that if the deal ultimately collapses, he may fear that historians will conclude that his legacy in global affairs collapsed with it. There is a reason one gets the feeling that it is the United States and not Iran that is the more eager, even desperate, side in these talks, even though Iran is the country whose economy was sent into a deep chill by international sanctions; the country whose only significant export, oil, lost more than half of its value in recent months. The reason is that Obama has a huge political stake in these negotiations. The President may insist that the United States will choose no deal over a bad deal, but few people truly believe he has a credible Plan B. Few believe it, particularly in the Middle East and notably among America's Arab friends, who hold the view that Iran is running circles around the United States and outplayed Obama. As the writer David Rothkopf aptly put it, "Iran is having a great Obama administration." That's a belief that has already started shaking up the region. Saudi Arabia has said that it will pursue nuclear weapons if it believes Iran has not been stopped, and there is little doubt that other countries among Iran's Muslim rivals will do the same. In fact, the notion that Obama is not handling the Iranian threat effectively is contributing to a new war in Yemen, where Saudi Arabia and other Arabs are trying to push back against gains by Iran's allies. We can trace it all back to the Democratic primaries in 2007, when then-Sen. Obama said he would meet Iran's leaders "without preconditions," leading his rival, Hillary Clinton, to call the idea "Irresponsible and frankly naive." As the years of his presidency unfolded, and the Middle East started coming apart, finding a deal with Iran started to look like the one major foreign policy achievement Obama might leave behind. The political imperative started to intrude in strategic considerations on an issue that is of transcendent importance to world peace. The framework agreement announced on Thursday came two days after Obama's March 31 deadline. The U.S.-imposed deadline served only to pressure the United States, and the French ambassador very publicly decried as a "bad tactic." That bad tactic was a political move, a push to produce some sort of result, however vague, to protect the talks from critics. Again, a solid agreement that ensures Iran will not produce nuclear weapons would be a most welcome development. But the agreement so far does not look promising. It certainly shows the final outcome will differ greatly from what Obama had vowed. In a presidential debate in 2012, Obama described a crystal clear goal for negotiations. "The deal we'll accept is they end their nuclear program. It's very straightforward." Nobody is talking about Iran ending its nuclear program. Not even close. Iran will be allowed to keep one-third of its more than 6,000 centrifuges. That's not a small symbolic number. And it does not appear as though any of its nuclear facilities will be dismantled, although Fordow will contain no nuclear materials. Iran has insisted all along that its nuclear program has only civilian uses. The fact is that Iran has a well-established record of lying and concealing the elements of its nuclear program to U.N. inspectors. And the U.N. agency chief says that has not stopped. A couple of weeks ago, with days left until the negotiating deadline, U.N. nuclear chief Yukiya Amano said Iran is still stonewalling. "We are still not in a position to conclude that all nuclear material in Iran is [for a] peaceful purpose," he warned. The negotiations' starting point is that Iran would like to have the bomb and the international community wants to delay that as much as possible -- and preferably, forever. The world only learned about Iran's secret facilities at Arak and Natanz after dissidents raised the alarm. Iran, we have learned repeatedly, is very good at lying to international inspectors. It is well-established that it has had something to hide about its nuclear program. It is well-established that many of Iran's neighbors don't trust it and are anxious about the U.S.-led international dealings with Iran. It is well-established that Iran has engaged in international terrorism and in destabilizing the region. It is also clear that it took harsh international sanctions and a collapse in oil prices to bring Iran to the negotiating table. It was Iran that had the most to lose from a failure of talks. But political considerations turned the United States into the supplicant. The framework agreement starts lifting those indispensable sanctions much too soon. Nuclear enrichment will continue, although at a lower level. Iran officially, legally, becomes a nuclear threshold state, with the capability to make the final dash to a bomb within a "breakout" period of one year, the time when presumably inspectors would discover violation and allow the rest of the world to act. Even the Fordow facility, conveniently inside a fortified bunker in a mountain, will remain in existence, though "converted" to a nuclear "research facility" And without nuclear material on site. International sanctions lifting will begin almost immediately. Its nuclear infrastructure will remain largely in place, even if operating at a reduced pace, giving Iran much of what it wanted. With Iranian forces gaining ground in Arab lands and Iranian commanders declaring the destruction of Israel "nonnegotiable" and threatening Saudi Arabia, this deal does not look reassuring. Obama is right that a diplomatic solution is the most desirable option. But the deal so far looks like (another) win for Iran. It introduces enough restrictions that it could give the President the political cover he wants, but it does not do enough to make the world safe from nuclear proliferation and more potentially catastrophic instability in the Middle East.

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence. President Obama's desire for a deal with Iran has led to a weak agreement that does not ensure Iran will not produce nuclear weapons, and has weakened America's hand in the negotiations. JAMIE CARRAGHER: Yaya Toure ducked out of his

Article: Given the inexorable march of the past 12 months in one direction, perhaps it is only appropriate that Rory McIlroy should spend the eve of the Masters on Wednesday with a member of the celebrated boy band of that name. But it is not lookalike Harry Styles who will carry the Northern Irishman's bag in the par-three tournament but keen golfer Niall Horan as McIlroy looks for a little light relief before his first attempt to complete a career Grand Slam. One Direction released their debut album in 2011, the same year McIlroy won his first major, so you could say they have mirrored each other, hit for greatest hit. Rory McIlroy watches a tee shot during a practice round prior to the start of the 2015 Masters Tournament. McIlroy alongside his caddie Caroline Wozniacki during the 2014 Par 3 Contest  in Augusta. McIlroy celebrates with his  Wozniacki on the 9th hole during  the Par 3 contest at Augusta National Golf Club. At last year's Masters, McIlroy piqued the interest of one or two photographers when then fiancee Caroline Wozniacki donned the caddie's famous white boiler suit. He might find the curiosity levels are even greater this time, for One Direction are even more popular in the US than in Britain. Between them, Niall, an honorary member at Mullingar, Westmeath, and Rory might do more to stir up interest in golf among the young than any number of 'old fogey' initiatives. 'We met in Australia at the end of last year and he was saying he had never been to The Masters,' said McIlroy. 'I said if you're available on the Wednesday you're more than welcome to carry the bag. Niall's really excited.' Niall Horan will swap girls screams for Augusta greens as he caddies for golfer McIlroy. McIlroy hits a putt in the rain during a practice round prior to the start of the 2015 Masters Tournament. McIlroy looked more subdued than excited at his press conference yesterday, possibly because he knew what was coming. On the one hand, he feels as ready as he ever will for his tilt at history. On the other, he had to spend 30 minutes with journalists wanting to trawl over his poor record at Augusta. Here is a sample: Why is your record so bad on the par fives, Rory? Why have you never birdied either the first or the 10th holes? Why have you left here for the past five years with at least one 77 on your score card? What the hell's wrong given all the advantages offered by your length off the tee? McIlroy  walks over the Nelson Bridge with caddie J.P. Fitzgerald during a practice round. To be fair, he answered them all with politeness. After all, there was nothing there he had not analysed and dissected countless times himself. McIlroy knows better than anyone he has no chance unless he does better on the long holes. He brought up the point raised in the Sportsmail graphic from last Saturday, which compared his record on the par fives last year with that of winner Bubba Watson. 'Just look at the two par fives on the back nine on Sunday,' he said. 'I had a nine iron in my hand for my second shot on both and I walked off with two sixes. Two fours I'd have finished third. McIlroy waits under an umbrella during a practice round prior to the start of the 2015 Masters Tournament. 'It's something I've been thinking about a lot. Look at Bubba, who played them in eight-under for the week to my level par and beat me by eight shots. 'I've just been too aggressive at times. I had four sixes on par-fives last year, so if I can clean up those, I'll have a chance to win.' As for those 77s, he said: 'It's not like I'm having a bad 18 holes. It's always just a bad nine holes that causes the damage and it's usually on a Friday, like last year. But I am better equipped now to handle it if things don't go right way. Mentally, I'm in a far better place.' McIlroy conceded that the circus surrounding Tiger Woods's return had not been unhelpful and the draw has worked out pretty well, too. The place you do not want to be come Thursday is in one of the last two groups, like Woods, but McIlroy has been treated kindly, with a mid-morning threesome alongside Americans Phil Mickelson and Ryan Moore. 'I don't think I've played alongside Phil at Augusta so that's perfect,' he said. 'We always get along well and he has a great record here. It will be fun to watch him.' It was this time last week, while practising in Florida, that McIlroy pronounced himself ready to go. 'It's been great not to have to think of anything technical while I'm playing,' he said. 'I've been able to enjoy the build-up.' Rory McIlroy waits with his caddie Fitzgerald in the rain during a practice round  at Augusta National Golf Club. Asked who he saw as favourite, McIlroy went for Bubba — ironic given a recent ESPN survey among the pros ranked Watson as the least favourite. 'I take it as I need to improve as a man,' said Watson, with the sort of annoying comment that explains his unpopularity in the first place. As for McIlroy, he knows where he needs to improve. 'You look at this course and it should fit me perfectly from tee to green,' he said. After One Direction on Wednesday, it'll be his turn to generate some roars.

Article: Tracey Neville would say she has never lived in the shadow of her footballing brothers. She might not have enjoyed their fame or their financial success. At the peak of her career as an England netball player who won bronze medals at the Commonwealth Games and World Cup, she earned just £742 a month. But there has been no shortage of ambition and no lack of personality. She is Phil Neville's twin and I ask her which of them, back on January 21, 1977, emerged first. 'I don't think there was ever any way Philip was coming out before me,' she says in a broad Bury accent enriched by an endearing burst of laughter. Tracey Neville, pictured at Hotel Football in Manchester, is Phil Neville's twin and sister to Gary Neville. Neville gives a team talk to her Manchester Thunder players during a match with Surrey Storm last year. England coach and Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville poses with his sister Tracey and her friends. It might explain why it is Tracey who has risen to the rank of national head coach first, taking England's netball team to this summer's World Cup in Australia while her brothers continue to combine coaching and broadcasting. Gary has spent the past three years as assistant to England manager Roy Hodgson. Tracey was parachuted into the top job on an interim basis last month and will select a squad of 12 for the tournament in August. Winning it will be no easy task, even if England are ranked third in the world. They failed to win a medal in last year's Commonwealth Games and poor results in a recent Test series convinced netball chiefs to turn to 38-year-old Neville, who has performed impressively as the boss at Manchester Thunder. How England perform will impact on funding with up to £4million at stake. The pressure is on. She revived an ageing Thunder team with an injection of youth and has secured two Superleague titles in three years. They are top of the league and later this month will contest their Superleague semi-final at the Manchester Arena, with some suggesting there are echoes of a certain local football team. Like Gary and Phil, she was first capped for her country at 19, eventually making 81 international appearances before a knee injury forced her to retire — and she says her personality is probably a mixture of the brothers'. Sportsmail's Chief Sports Reporter, Matt Lawton, interviews Neville over breakfast at Hotel Football. Phil Neville, who now works as pundit with BT Sport and the BBC, takes a selfie with his twin sister. Neville celebrates with her Manchester Thunder team after clinching the Superleague title in April last year. 'I think we're all natural leaders,' she says as she tucks into a cooked breakfast at Hotel Football, which stands next to Old Trafford and counts her brothers and Manchester United's other 'Class of 92' players among its main investors. 'I'd say I'm quite intense, like Gary. He and I would clash quite a lot. Not to the detriment of our relationship. We're very close. But Philip would be the mediator.' So Phil's the nice one? 'I think I am,' she says, chuckling again. 'I'm probably not as intense as Gary and I'm not the mediator that Philip is. I'm somewhere in the middle. I have bits of both personality traits. 'But I can definitely hold my own with the two of them. I'm probably the one who winds Gary up, to be honest. Being a girl I probably know how to push his buttons.' She says she was never dazzled by the success her brothers enjoyed at United or by the fact that Gary's best mate was David Beckham. 'I knew them all when they were earning £29.50 a week in digs,' she says. And she claims never to have been the sister her brothers turned to for fashion or girlfriend advice. 'We never had those kind of conversations,' she says. 'And Gary and clothes? I don't think they are ever in the same conversation really (cue more laughter). Neville, who will manage England at the netball World Cup, believes she is a natural leader like her brothers. Gary Neville (left) leads Wayne Rooney, James Milner and Michael Carrick (L-R) in England training. Neville represents England at the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur aged just 21. 'But we have an awesome dynamic. We obviously all have a competitive edge but not to the detriment of each other. As kids we were like a pack of cubs. We always looked after our own and that's still the case today. We rely on that support system.' Even as kids, her brothers treated her as an equal. 'I was never a girl they put in the field when we played cricket or in goal when we played football,' she says. 'I was always pretty good at all sports and I would give it my all. 'I would have been a good footballer. I loved playing. My mum was the footballer in the family. She played as a striker. That didn't rub off because like Gary and Phil I was a defender. In the end the big decision I had to make was between hockey and netball. I'd made some good friends in netball so that was the option I took.' Understandably, there is what she describes as 'a certain connection' with Phil. 'We probably speak more,' she says. 'Because Gary's so busy I would see more of his family, his kids, than I do him. 'He never talks about himself. He won the award last week (best sports presenter at the RTS Awards) and nobody in the family even knew he was up for it. He wouldn't say he wants to be the next England manager because his focus will be on the job he's doing at the moment. And when I told Gary I'd got this job, it was just a one-word text response. 'Brilliant,' he said. There was more from Philip. 'Unbelievable. So proud.' I think he tweeted something. That's the difference.' Before Australia she will draw on the experience of both brothers. Phil spent a season as assistant coach to David Moyes at Manchester United. Given the opportunity she would also like to pick the brains of Sir Alex Ferguson. Neville would love to have a coffee with Sir Alex Ferguson and pick his brains before the netball World Cup. Phil Neville spent last season on the coaching staff at Manchester United, with 10 months under David Moyes. Neville has worked in hospitality and earned a maths degree in Bristol and sports science degree in Chester. 'If he wouldn't mind having a coffee with me I'd love to do that,' she says. 'But I've got 30 minutes booked in with Gary. 'There are certain challenges in our sport. It's difficult for the girls to be full-time, and often their jobs become more important because there isn't the financial support. 'I had some difficult financial times as a player. I had great support from my family but I had to take different jobs to support myself. 'I worked in hospitality and got into coaching education and I studied too. I got a maths degree in Bristol before studying for a sports science degree in Chester. These days I'm working with girls who are doctors, lawyers, zoologists. 'But I think I'm a better coach than I ever was a player. One of my strengths is the integration of young players and the way I build a team around a certain ethos. I also have a good understanding of the game.' The challenge is nevertheless significant, as Australia and New Zealand are the powerhouses in netball. 'The Sport England target is to get to the final but we've never made a final before,' she says. 'Last year we finished fourth in the Commonwealths. The team didn't perform to their best so it's my job to get them doing that. 'Ideally I'd like to have had longer to prepare. In a perfect world you'd get a four-year cycle. 'Right now the future beyond the World Cup is uncertain. We'll just have to see how it goes. But I had to take this opportunity. I've always had such passion for England.' She's certainly not alone there. lnformation on Manchester Thunder's semi-final at the Manchester Arena is at www.manchesterthunder.com.

Article: Substitute Eidur Gudjohnsen spared Bolton's blushes with virtually the final kick of the game and denied Blackpool a first away victory in 343 days in a 1-1 draw. Michael Jacobs' ninth-minute opener looked to have given the bottom-of-the-table Seasiders their first success on the road since they beat Wanderers' neighbours Wigan on April 26. But Bolton, who have repeatedly conceded late goals themselves in recent weeks, mustered an equaliser in the fifth minute of stoppage time when Emile Heskey, Neil Danns and Gudjohnsen combined to leave the visitors crestfallen. Blackpool's Michael Jacobs (left) scores against Bolton Wanderers. Bolton: Amos, Vela, Mills, McCarthy, Ream, Danns, Bannan, Feeney (Gudjohnsen 77'), Rochinha (Heskey 46'), Walker (Craig Davies 68'), Le Fondre. Subs not used: Bogdan, Moxey, Dervite, Trotter. Booked: Feeney, Vela. Goals: Gudjohnsen 90' Blackpool: Lewis, Hall, Clarke, O'Dea, Dunne, Cubero, O'Hara, Perkins, Orlandi (Barkhuizen 84'), Madine, Jacobs. Subs not used: Delfouneso, Oliver, Parish, Ferguson, Telford, Samuel. Booked: Clarke, Madine, Lewis. Goals: Jacobs 9' Referee: David Coote. Attendance: 17,076. It was at this very venue that Blackpool boss Lee Clark pulled off a great escape on the final day of last season at the helm of Birmingham, who scored in the third minute of stoppage time to prevent relegation into the third tier, but this time he was on the wrong end of some late drama. In recent weeks Clark had publicly accepted the Seasiders, who remain 16 points from safety, were doomed but Rotherham's defeat to Blues 24 hours earlier meant they kicked off knowing they would not be relegated at the Macron Stadium. That may have instilled a freedom to Clark's troops and the home crowd were stunned into silence by Jacobs' early opener. He collected a long, direct ball down the right, turned on the afterburners to accelerate away from Josh Vela and Paddy McCarthy and lashed beyond Ben Amos in the Bolton goal. Things could have been worse for the shell-shocked hosts too as Peter Clarke headed straight at Amos and an unmarked Andrea Orlandi glanced over from six yards. Clark's men continued to ask questions, with Jose Miguel Cubero's rising effort deflected narrowly away from the top corner of Amos' net. Bolton Wanderers' Josh Vela and Blackpool's Jamie O'Hara (right) vie for the ball. Tangerines stopper Joe Lewis made a couple of smart stops to deny winger Liam Feeney and centre-back McCarthy but there was a malaise about Bolton's play which Neil Lennon had been so keen to avoid pre-match. In the second half, Amos failed to clear a corner and Clarke leant back and skewed his effort over the top before Jacobs cut in from the left flank and bent a brilliant effort just wide. Lewis had been largely untroubled apart from a routine save from Tom Walker but he was stranded at the other end of his goal when Adam Le Fondre cut the ball across for an onrushing Barry Bannan, who somehow placed his side-footed strike against the outside of the post. Lennon had started with just one striker but introduced three off the bench by bringing on Heskey, Craig Davies and Gudjohnsen. The hosts' chance looked to have gone when Lewis stopped McCarthy's header and O'Hara scrambled Mills' try off the line but there was still time for a dramatic finale. Heskey looked certain to nod Bannan's back-post cross in but when he could not connect, the ball came back out to Danns, whose volley was helped in by Gudjohnsen on the line, with Blackpool fuming about an offside flag which never came.

Article: (CNN)Universal's "Furious 7" continues to build momentum at the Friday box office for a weekend debut in the $135 million-$138 million range, the largest opening in North America since fall 2013. That includes a projected Friday take of $58 million-$60 million. The final film featuring the late Paul Walker, "Furious 7" is opening around the globe this weekend and earned a record-breaking $60 million internationally on Wednesday and Thursday for a possible worldwide debut approaching or crossing $300 million by the end of Easter Sunday. "Furious 7" is getting the widest release in Universal's history. Domestically, it will be playing in 4,003 theaters by Good Friday. Internationally, it has booked more than 10,500 screens in 63 territories, although it won't open in China, Japan and Russia until later. The current record-holder for top April opening domestically is "Captain America: The Winter Soldier," which debuted to $95 million from 3,928 theaters last year. "Furious 7" is likewise poised to nab the biggest opening of 2015 to date. And it will easily beat the $121.9 million launch of "The Hunger Games Mockingjay — Part 1" in November 2104, making it the largest three-day opening since "The Hunger Games: Catching Fire" ($158 million) in November 2013. The movie enjoys massive awareness and interest, due to both the popularity of the street-racing series and Walker's death. The last film, "Fast & Furious 6," debuted to a franchise-best $117 million over the four-day Memorial Day weekend in 2012, including $97.4 million for the three days, on its way to grossing $788.7 million worldwide. Universal intended to open "Furious 7" on July 11, 2014, but production was halted in November 2013 when Walker died in a car crash during the Thanksgiving hiatus. After director James Wan, writer Chris Morgan and Universal pored over existing footage and tweaked the script, production resumed in April 2014. CGI and voice effects were used in some scenes featuring Walker's detective character, Brian O'Conner, with Walker's brothers, Caleb and Cody, used as stand-ins. "Furious 7" pits Vin Diesel's Dominic Toretto and crew (which includes Michelle Rodriguez and Tyrese Gibson, among others, as well as Walker) against Jason Statham's Deckard Shaw, out for revenge after the death of his brother. Dwayne Johnson also reprises his role as Hobbs. ©2015 The Hollywood Reporter. All rights reserved.

Murray plays a forehand against Djokovic  in the final during the Miami Open  at Crandon Park Tennis Center. ‘There’ll be no celebrities as such, I don’t have any celebrity friends so it wasn’t something that was planned,’ said Murray, before he flew back after his Miami Open final defeat to runaway world No 1 Novak Djokovic on Sunday. The one possible exception is comedian James Corden, although he is busy working in America. There will be quite a few friends prominent in British tennis — aside from anything Kim’s father Nigel has been one of the country’s leading coaches — but with the Monte Carlo Open beginning next Monday the bigger international names were always going to be otherwise engaged. Murray and Djokovic pose for a photograph prior to the mens final during the Miami Open. Djokovic holds the winners trophy after defeating Murray in the final of the Miami Open. In fact the only non-British player likely to attend is Jean-Julien Rojer, a doubles specialist from the Dutch Antilles who has a base in Miami. ‘Jules lives there and I spend quite a lot of time with him. Tim (Henman) will be coming. James Ward, Jamie Delgado (longstanding British player and coach). ‘We invited Kyle Edmund but he can’t make it because he’s playing,’ said Murray, who confirmed the couple will not cash in on photography rights to any magazines. Other tennis guests include coach Amelie Mauresmo, former assistant coach Dani Vallverdu and two of his three best men, brother Jamie and former Davis Cup player Ross Hutchins. The third is Carlos Mier, a friend from his days at the Barcelona tennis academy he attended. Kim Sears fiancee of Murray  watches him in action against Djokovic in the fierce Miami sun. ‘Everyone who we’re close to, people we’ve spent a lot of time with in the past and people that we see ourselves spending time with in the future. That’s how we came up with the list,’ said Murray. Rather than asking for wedding gifts, the couple have requested that guests make a donation to charities they support such as UNICEF and the World Wildlife Fund. ‘I’m going to go up to Scotland early and spend time with my family for a couple of days. I’m not going to hit any balls this week. Pretty much everything is done now and under control. I’m sure a few things will come up. World No 3 Murray is set to marry his fiancee Sears in Dunblane next Saturday. ‘Kim has pretty much controlled most of the important things and I’ve tried to help when she’s asked. I haven’t been overly involved but there’s things I enjoy doing, I did all the food and cake tasting which I actually loved.’ There will not be any honeymoon until later in the year. In the middle of next week Murray will head to Barcelona to train with incoming assistant coach, former Swedish player Jonas Bjorkman, before resuming his tournament schedule the week after that in Munich. Another change in the new rankings on Monday was Spaniard Rafael Nadal moving down to No 5.

Article: Going to any major sporting event these days is a pricey affair. There’s the cost of the ticket, getting to the venue and the all important souvenirs. That’s not to mention keeping fed and watered all day. But it seems patrons at the Masters can get themselves a decent meal for a reasonable price. You can get a taste of the south with a Bar-B-Que or Classic Chicken sandwich for $3 — which is about £2.05. The Masters is one few sporting events which offers food at reasonable prices for its punters. Shot of the day. Lee Westwood nearly got off to the perfect start with a stunning shot at the par-five second. After a perfect tee shot, he pinged a fairway wood 280 yards onto the green. It trickled towards the hole and looked to be heading in for an albatross, but it lipped out at the last moment. It was a high point for Westwood, though, who then made five bogeys in his next nine holes. New practice routine Padraig? Padraig Harrington has enjoyed a resurgence of form in recent months and the secret of his success could be down to his unusual practice technique. The Irishman was spotted on the driving range at Augusta with a rubber band wrapped around his knees and standing well away from the ball (1). He then takes a run-up at the ball (2), not dissimilar to that of Happy Gilmore — a character from a comedy film whose own run-up technique would see him regularly drive the ball more than 400 yards. Harrington’s might not travel quite as far, but the drill obviously helps him keep his form and balance nicely (3). Gary's still a player. At 79, and with a career grand slam behind him, you might forgive Gary Player for putting his feet up. But the South African is fit as a flea. After joining Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer as an honorary starter, he tweeted:. Time for a Texas takeover? Jordan Spieth has been the star and if the Dallas native wins from here, he would claim Texas’s 13th green jacket, more than any other US state. Same old for Sergio. After a 68 on day one, a 74 in his second round was a disappointment for Sergio Garcia. He tweeted:. Lost and found. Tiger Woods might have lost a touch of his genius in recent years, but he won’t be losing his putter any time soon — he has his name inscribed on it. And his precise practice sessions were clearly paying off as he finished with a 69, a four-shot improvement on round one. Tiger Woods has his name inscribed  on his putter and will hope it brings him  luck going into the weekend. 1.39. Despite his best efforts, Woods could not match the white-hot putting of Jordan Spieth. The 21-year-old has averaged 1.39 putts per hole, the best in the field.

Article: UEFA have set a potentially dangerous precedent by ruling that the final 18 seconds of England Women's U19 European Championships qualifier against Norway will be replayed after a refereeing mistake. The Elite Round Group 4 qualifier will be restarted at 9:45pm at Seaview stadium in Belfast on Thursday with the match resuming with England retaking a penalty in the 96th minute at 2-1 down. England's 3-1 Group 4 victory against Switzerland on Thursday afternoon means the Young Lionesses will qualify for the European Championships if the penalty is scored and the match is drawn 2-2. England are awarded a penalty during their European U19 Women's Championships qualifier in Belfast. Referee Marija Kurtes points to the spot as England are awarded a penalty in the 96th minute. Leah Williamson steps up to take a penalty in the closing stages of the match against Norway. Williamson runs forward to strike the ball but team-mate Rosella Ayane (circled) has entered the box. Williamson turns and celebrates as she slots the ball into the goalkeeper's bottom-right corner. German referee Marija Kurtes officiating a women's Bundesliga match in Munich last month. Jenna Dear scored twice at the Seaview Stadium while Leah Williamson, who is set to take the last minute spot-kick against Norway, earned some practice as she scored past Swiss goalkeeper Tania Chassot from 12-yards. Norway are second in the group following an impressive 8-1 win against Northern Ireland, but crucially have a slightly inferior goal difference meaning the spot-kick will give England a place in the European Championship finals in Israel. The astonishing decision has been taken for the first time in a UEFA competition following an FA appeal after the referee had wrongly denied England the opportunity to retake the penalty during Saturday's match following encroachment. England midfielder Williamson thought she had equalised after slotting the ball into the bottom-right corner but team-mate Rosella Ayane had entered the box too early and German referee Marija Kurtes disallowed the goal. However, instead of ordering it to be retaken, 28-year-old Kurtes - who was named Referee of the Year by the German Football Association (DFB) in 2014 - wrongly awarded an indirect free-kick to Norway. According to the laws of the game, a penalty should be retaken if it entered the goal after encroachment by team-mates of the player taking the kick. England players celebrate after they thought they had equalised against Norway. But referee Kurtes awards an indirect free-kick and the celebrations are cut short. Williamson has the ball back in her hands ready for what she thought would be a retake. But Williamson then realises the referee's decision and two Norwegian players are seen celebrating. German referee Kurtes is understood to have been sent home following her error on Saturday. April 4 - England 1-2 Norway (Match to be replayed from 96th min on April 9 at 9:45pm) April 4 - Switzerland 1-0 Northern Ireland. April 6 - Norway 2-0 Switzerland. April 6 - England 9-1 Northern Ireland. April 9 - Switzerland 1-3 England. April 9 - Northern Ireland 1-8 Norway. A scene of apparent confusion followed England's wild celebrations as Kurtes explained her decision. Williamson had grabbed back the ball to retake the penalty and placed it on the penalty spot before realising an indirect free-kick had been awarded. Two Norwegian players then embraced as they celebrated the decision. A UEFA statement read: 'The UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body has ordered the match to be replayed. 'The replay of the match should be carried out as follows:. 'The match will be replayed from the minute the penalty kick was awarded to the Football Association at the European Women's Under-19 Championship 2015 match between England vs Norway played on April 4, 2015, and extended according to the discretion of the referee. 'The penalty kick shall be retaken by the Football Association. 'According to the Laws of the Game (Law 14), a team-mate of the player taking the kick infringes the Laws of the Game:. - the referee allows the kick to be taken. - if the ball enters the goal, the kick is retaken. - if the ball does not enter the goal, the referee stops play and the match is restarted with an indirect free kick to the defending team from the place where the infringement occurred. 'As the ball entered the goal, the kick should have been re-taken. Thus the CDEB ordered that the remaining time of the match should be replayed in accordance with article 6 (e) and 7 (2) of the disciplinary regulations. Williamson scored from the penalty spot during England's 3-1 victory against Switzerland on Thursday. Jenna Dear (right) scores with a header as England inched closer to European Championship qualification. 'The match is scheduled to take place at the Seaview Stadium in Belfast on Thursday at 9:45pm local time with another referee. 'Teams must field the same players which were on the pitch at that moment. Any of these players can take the penalty kick.' An FA spokesperson said: 'After England Women U19s' match against Norway on Saturday, April 4, the FA lodged an appeal to UEFA following a disallowed penalty. 'Due to an incorrect application of the game's laws by the match referee, UEFA have ordered the match to be replayed from the point of the penalty. 'The remainder of the match will be played on Thursday at 9.45pm at the same stadium – Seaview, Belfast.' Williamson is congratulated by her England team-mates after scoring past Swiss goalkeeper Tania Chassot. Former Everton and England captain Mo Marley is head coach of the national women's U19 team. Although it will only last 18 seconds, officials, stewards and paramedics will all be required to attend. Admission is free. England, coached by former national captain Mo Marley, were 2-0 down to Norway on Saturday before substitute Ayane pulled one back in the 87th minute to give her side hope of claiming a point. However, Wiliiamson's penalty was disallowed and the match ended in defeat. England brushed off the disappointment on Monday, though, with a 9-1 win against Northern Ireland. Both England and Norway must start the match with the same 11 players who finished Saturday's match. However, a different player can take the penalty. The decision further complicates the already complex qualification process for July's finals after UEFA had announced that Norway had sealed their place. After an initial qualifying round last year, the Elite Round is comprised of six groups of four teams playing at locations across Europe. The six group winners and best-placed runner-up - decided by the best record against the first and third-placed teams in the groups - go through to join hosts Israel at the showpiece event in July. England women's senior head coach Mark Sampson tweeted: 'Difficult circumstances for our @england U19. I have been proud that in challenging circumstances you have conducted yourselves superbly & represented your country with great pride. 'Regardless of final outcome you should be very proud. We are very proud of you.' September 2005 - World Cup qualifier - Uzbekistan vs Bahrain. Uzbekistan had won the opening leg of the Asian zone fourth-round play-off 1-0 at home but were left incensed after a penalty was disallowed in the 38th minute for an attacking player encroaching. Rather than retaking the penalty, an indirect free-kick was wrongly awarded by Japanese referee Toshimitsu Yoshida to Bahrain and the game ended with a one-goal margin. Uzbekistan called for an investigation but were left furious after FIFA ordered the match to be replayed in its entirety with the result declared invalid. It proved to have a major impact as it was Bahrain who eventually went through with a 1-1 away goals victory, though they were later beaten in the AFC-CONCACAF play-off. Bahrain staff and players celebrate after beating Uzbekistan in an Asian World Cup qualifier in 2005.

Article: He has been a colossus of the game. He has made 700 professional club appearances and won 81 caps for England, six Premier League titles, the FA Cup and the Champions League. In his pomp, he was the stuff of strikers' nightmares, driving some of the world's greatest goalscorers to distraction with lightning-sharp reactions and an instinctive reading of the game. That's why it's such a shame that what is likely to be Rio Ferdinand's farewell year in the English game has fizzled out. Rio Ferdinand pictured in training at Queens Park Rangers last week. The 36-year-old defender started regularly in the first part of the season but has been unable to hold down his spot in the side. Ferdinand started the first seven matches of QPR's Premier League campaign before being dropped. Ferdinand has enjoyed a fantastic career, winning six Premier League titles, but a fairytale finish is unlikely. Ferdinand and Ryan Giggs lift the European Cup for Manchester United in Moscow back in 2008. Ferdinand also won 81 caps for England during his glittering career. He would love to be out there, hunting down and hassling opponents, robbing attackers of the ball, winning the aerial duels, playing his part in Queens Park Rangers' survival mission. Keeping them up would be a fitting curtain call. Instead, Ferdinand's season has been one spent on the margins - either suspended, benched or out of the squad altogether. Once again, the 36-year-old was forced to watch on from the sidelines as Rangers claimed a potentially crucial point away to Aston Villa on Tuesday night. Ferdinand had picked up a slight knock and was ruled out. He has played just five times since the start of October - not much of a swansong. On Sunday, he posted a Twitter picture of a pile of chicken bones after lunch at his mum's. He had not been involved in the 4-1 win at West Brom 24 hours earlier and it weirdly seemed to sum up his peripheral role at the moment. By contrast, Ferdinand had started QPR's first seven games of the campaign, lasting the full 90 minutes in all of them. Harry Redknapp had grand plans and the best of intentions last summer. Having called time on his Manchester United career after 12 trophy-laden seasons, Ferdinand moved to Loftus Road in what Redknapp described as a'remarkable coup for the club.' Harry Redknapp described Ferdinand's signing last summer as a'remarkable coup' for the club. But after initial promise, Ferdinand has largely spent the season on the bench. Premier League (6): 2002-03, 2006-07, 2007-08, 2008-09, 2010-11, 2012-13. FA Cup (1): 2003-04. Football League Cup (2): 2005-06, 2008-09. FA Community Shield (5): 2003, 2007, 2008, 2011, 2013. Champions League (1): 2007-08. FIFA Club World Cup (1): 2008. Even in his mid-thirties, Redknapp believed Ferdinand would bring 'quality, class, experience and know-how' as QPR returned to the top flight. He envisaged Ferdinand in a sweeper role, the central pivot of a three-man defence in an in-vogue 3-5-2 system. He would bring all that experience to bear, helping Clint Hill and Steven Caulker keep opposition attacks at bay. Unfortunately, it just didn't work. In their first seven Premier League games of the season, QPR won one, drew one and lost five. They leaked 15 goals and the scale of their task in staying in the top division was clear. Ferdinand was demoted to the bench, Richard Dunne and Nedum Onuoha were introduced and the dye was cast for the season. His suspension for using the word'sket' in a tweet didn't help and by the time that was served, Ferdinand was down the pecking order. Ferdinand has shown glimpses of his imperious best for QPR this season. But Ferdinand's farewell season in English football has not lived up to his expectations. Chris Ramsey has played Ferdinand on three occasions since taking over from Harry Redknapp. Queens Park Rangers find themselves two points from safety after their 3-3 draw at Aston Villa on Tuesday. As you would expect, Ferdinand has conducted himself like a model professional on the training ground, maintaining his fitness in case he was called upon. And there have been such occasions, notably the 2-0 win at Sunderland in February - Chris Ramsey's second game in charge after replacing Redknapp, that ended QPR's 11-game losing run on the road. Ferdinand may yet be called upon again in the run-in, with QPR sitting two points shy of safety, but the season so far will have fallen short of his hopes and expectations. That fairytale finale, with Ferdinand leading an heroic resistance to keep Rangers in the Premier League, seems unlikely. There are rumours that clubs in the money-soaked Qatar Stars League are preparing to tempt Ferdinand with one final payday but that remains to be seen. For now, Rio's farewell has sadly fallen a bit flat. The fixtures remaining for the bottom six in the Barclays Premier League.

Rio Ferdinand missed 3-3 thriller with Aston Villa through injury. He has featured in just five QPR matches since the start of October. Harry Redknapp initially wanted him to be at centre of a back three. But the plan backfired as Rangers made a poor start in Premier League. Ferdinand has found it difficult to regain his place in farewell year.

Article: (CNN)According to an outside review by Columbia Journalism School professors, "(a)n institutional failure at Rolling Stone resulted in a deeply flawed article about a purported gang rape at the University of Virginia." The Columbia team concluded that "The failure encompassed reporting, editing, editorial supervision and fact-checking." Hardly a ringing endorsement of the editorial process at the publication. The magazine's managing editor, Will Dana, wrote, "We would like to apologize to our readers and to all of those who were damaged by our story and the ensuing fallout, including members of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity and UVA administrators and students." Brian Stelter: Fraternity to 'pursue all available legal action' The next question is:. Can UVA, Phi Kappa Psi or any of the other fraternities on campus sue for defamation? The Virginia Supreme Court said in Jordan v. Kollman that "the elements of libel are (1) publication of (2) an actionable statement with (3) the requisite intent." "Actionable" means the statement must be both false and defamatory. Of course, the law of defamation must be balanced against the freedom of speech protected under not only the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, but also the Virginia Constitution. True statements cannot be defamatory. Neither can pure statements of opinion, because they theoretically cannot be either true or false. But the Rolling Stone article certainly purported to be fact, and it apparently is not exactly what the law considers "true." The individual members of the fraternity will likely be considered private individuals, and not public figures; the latter have a harder time proving defamation. A private person suing for defamation must establish that the defendant has published a false factual statement that is about the person and that it also harms the person's reputation. The private plaintiff also must show that the defendant knew that the statement was false, or believed it was true but lacked a reasonable basis, or acted negligently in checking the facts. At first blush, that sounds like it fits perfectly, right? The Columbia report may go a long way toward establishing at least a modicum of the required intent. But that's only half the battle. There are strict rules about who can be a plaintiff in a defamation action like this. The identity of the aspiring plaintiff matters. First, let's eliminate UVA. The university is a public university, and therefore it is a governmental entity. The Supreme Court has been clear on the issue of libelous statements about the government: The government cannot sue for defamation. There is no such cause of action in American jurisprudence. Now the fraternities, starting with Phi Kappa Psi. A fraternity is not an individual, but a group. A plaintiff in a defamation case must show that the statements were "of or concerning" the plaintiff. It sounds obvious, but if you're going to say a statement hurt you, you have to prove the statement actually was about you to begin with. When the statements are about a group without naming an individual, it's hard to say the statement is "concerning" the individual -- and groups generally cannot sue.  For example, you can be sued if you call a specific lawyer a thief, but that same person cannot sue you if you simply call all lawyers thieves. Defamatory statements about a group are therefore not actionable by the group's individual members, for the most part. Like all rules, however, there are exceptions. If the defamatory language is about "a comparatively small group of persons and the defamatory part is easily imputed against all members of the small group, an individual member may sue." If I said, "The 1980 Philadelphia Phillies infielders were a bunch of criminals" (they weren't),  the individual players could sue, because that mean statement is clearly about certain persons -- if I said that -- which I didn't. Phi Kappa Psi would likely argue that the "small group" exception fits it perfectly: Even if the individual members were not identified by name, the defamatory story has been imputed directly to individual members, who have suffered by their association with the group. On the other hand, Rolling Stone's lawyers would likely argue that the group is so large and fluid (after all, the membership changes somewhat every year), that even though the fraternity's reputation is tarnished, the members have suffered no individualized injury. As for the other fraternities on campus but not implicated in the story, that's likely a group that moves from the small category to large, and the members of Greek life generally will have a harder time bringing a lawsuit. Lawyers will tell you that a libel suit is one of those things that citizens often threaten each other with on Facebook, but that such cases are rarely actually filed. That's because a plaintiff usually has to show some kind of financial harm. So if your Aunt Edna calls you a loser on Twitter, you're going to have to spend money on an expert to explain to a jury how that actually damaged you financially. And since most of the people who waste time threatening each other with defamation suits  on Facebook live in their moms' basements and are "between jobs," these are not the kind of people who have money or reputation to damage in the first place. The UVA situation is not your run-of-the-mill defamation case. The university won't be able to sue, but if the members of the fraternity can get past some of the preliminary hurdles of a defamation claim, and they can make a tangible case for damages, then this could be one of those rare successful defamation cases.

Jack Wilshere is the latest man linked with a switch to the Etihad Stadium, where he would follow the likes of Emmanuel Adebayor, Bacary Sagna and Samir Nasri who swapped London for the North-West as City stormed towards Premier League and FA Cup glory. But times have changed. The Gunners are now ahead of City in the table and appear to be a club on the up, while the men from Manchester must rebuild. And if £30million or more is truly on the table for Wilshere, Arsenal must consider it. Manchester CIty are considering making a move for Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere this summer. Wilshere hasn't played for the first team since injuring his ankle against Manchester United in November. Alexis Sanchez cost Arsenal £30m, while Chelsea splashed out roughly the same amount to bring in Diego Costa. Those two forwards have a combined total of 33 league goals this season. And for all Wilshere's many talents, he would not be a game changer for Manuel Pellegrini, or whoever City's manager may be next season. He was touted as a future Arsenal and England midfielder when he burst onto the scene, showing the world what he can do in a Champions League tie against Barcelona, and possesses a technical ability which wouldn't see him out of place at the Nou Camp. His quick movement, superb touch and low centre of gravity is perfect for the sharp, driving style of play manager Wenger likes at the Emirates Stadium, as Wilshere's goal of the season against Norwich last season perfectly demonstrated. He has been doubted on several occasions, partly because of his lifestyle off the pitch, in the most part because of his treacherous injury record at the age of 23. The midfielder has picked up a total of 24 knocks during his seven-year professional career. He was tipped as a future Arsenal star and England international when he broke through the ranks in 2008. Wilshere is only 23 years old but has picked up 24 separate injuries during his professional career. But even as recently as this season, Wilshere was hitting form before going off against Manchester United. He was certainly more impressive than Aaron Ramsey and Santi Cazorla in the Arsenal midfield, and impressed for England in a deep-lying role. There now seems to be little space for the Stevenage-born schemer to fit in this starting XI. Ramsey, Cazorla, Sanchez, Francis Coquelin, and Mesut Ozil played behind Olivier Giroud in the recent thumping victory over Liverpool, and that's without the likes of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Tomas Rosicky, Theo Walcott and Danny Welbeck involved. Of course, the ideal state of play would be for Wenger to build a team around Wilshere, a man who is signed on for three more years, and not to consider any bids from divisional rivals at least. But Arsenal would be foolish to dismiss anything over £30m in today's market, especially considering the kind of players Wenger can now attract to the club. Wilshere impressed in a holding role for England in an international friendly against Scotland last year. He was in form before ankle surgery, scoring a fine goal against Manchester City in September. The midfielder fired past Brad Guzan to score the opening goal against Aston Villa last season. Wilshere's effort against Norwich was voted the 2013-14 Premier League Goal of the Season. Arsenal's relationship with City, who the club have never held a firm rivalry with, could also play a part. Any interest from fellow top-four clubs Chelsea or Manchester United would probably be dismissed immediately. The current Premier League champions are looking to rebuild under Sheik Mansour and need homegrown, young players to freshen up an ageing side. Wilshere is seen as a possibility along with Jordan Henderson in midfield. Raheem Sterling and Paul Pogba have also been linked with a summer transfer, with Nasri and Yaya Toure among many names who could leave. But with Liverpool set to hand Henderson the captain's armband after Steven Gerrard's departure, his stay would seem more likely despite his contract running down at Anfield. Arsenal fans would hate to see Wilshere go and he encapsulates the style at the Emirates. However, for a man who has scored five goals in his league career, and one who would not neccessarily push on close rivals to better things, it may be worth thinking about. Jordan Henderson is also a possibility for Manchester City as the club look for homegrown youngsters.

Manchester City considering bid for Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere. Jordan Henderson is also an option for the Premier League champions. Wilshere, 23, encapsulates Arsene Wenger's style of play in north London. But the England international is not necessarily a first-team regular. Any bids in excess of £30m should be considered by Arsenal.

Article: Wigan Warriors forward Ben Flower admitted that he regrets his attack on Lance Hohaia in the Super League Grand Final every day. The 27-year-old is coming to the end of a six-month ban and is preparing to return to rugby league, but he is mentally scarred by the events at Old Trafford in October. In front of over 75,000 spectators in Manchester, Flower shocked the world when he landed punches on Hohaia during the final between Wigan and St Helens. Ben Flower said that he regrets every day his attack on Lance Hohaia in the Super League Grand Final. Flower landed a sickening blow on Hohaia in front of 75,000 people at Old Trafford and with the world watching. The sickening moment was seen worldwide and went viral on the internet, leading to Flower receiving abuse and death threats. But Flower promised that he was a changed man and wants to come back and make a positive impact on the pitch when he returns, which could be this week against Warrington. He told the Guardian: 'I regret it every day. I was very shocked. It was horrible. 'I hated myself for what I did. It's brutal and it's something you don't do naturally. I'm not that person. I've not really watched it since then. Flower was handed a six-month ban for his brutal attack and was the first man to be sent off in the Grand Final. Flower feared he may go to prison, but promised that he is now a changed man after the incident. 'People were talking about the police getting involved which was really worrying me because you can go to prison for what I'd done. St Helens then put out a statement saying they supported me. It was real nice to know they had my back. 'It's definitely changed me. It changes the way you look at life. 'What I do next will hopefully define me as a player. I need to come back with a positive role on and off the pitch.'

Article: (CNN)One of Tokyo's most prominent districts has taken a small, but potentially significant step to recognizing same-sex unions in Japan. The government of Shibuya ward, one of the capital's most famous shopping and trendy entertainment districts, passed ordinance on Wednesday paving the way for "partnership certificates" for same-sex couples, allowing them some of the rights of married heterosexual couples. Same-sex partners who are registered with the district's ward office will be able to hold visitation rights in hospitals and co-sign tenancy agreements. Other advantages that heterosexual married couples enjoy, such as joint filing of taxes, are controlled by the federal government and are outside the remit of individual municipalities. The measure was proposed in February by Shibuya's mayor, Toshitake Kuwahara. While the certificates will not be issued until later in the summer and are not legally binding, proponents of marriage equality in socially conservative Japan say that the ward's decision is a step in the right direction. "It is not a marriage license and advantages will be limited but still better than nothing," Gon Matsunaka, a gay rights activist, told CNN. While Shibuya's decision does not yet equate to heterosexual marriage, the hope is that the move will be the beginnings of promoting marriage equality for gay communities. "What is important for the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) community in Shibuya is the ruling will make us visible in society,"  Matsunaka said. "It could be a strong driver for Shibuya citizens to learn and know what kind of problems LGBT people are facing." Taiga Ishikawa, Tokyo councillor and the first male gay local assembly member in Japan, told CNN the ordinance was a "big first step for the protection of human rights." He called the decision "happy" but said that it must go alongside education about alternative lifestyles. He said that the most important part of today's announcement is that it "should be actually put into practice, as should education for understanding (LGBT individuals) especially they suffer as they find out their sexuality when they are young." Neighboring Setagaya ward has indicated that it would look into following Shibuya's lead. However, former councilor Ishikawa cautioned against taking the movement's momentum for granted. "To realize equal rights for gay couples, a national law has to be made," he said. While outright discrimination against the LGBT community is rare in Japan, its effects can be hidden and gay people often find themselves at a disadvantage. Many hide their sexuality from their employers, co-workers, families and friends. But the tide may be turning. A recent poll found that a slight majority at 52.4% oppose gay marriage, but support amongst young adults in their 20s and 30s is as high as 70%. An editorial in the Asahi Shimbun newspaper, which commissioned the poll, welcomed the Shibuya decision, calling it "a bold and important step forward." Only traditional marriages are recognized under Japan's constitution, but the wording is vague enough to open it to interpretation, according to Mari Miura, a professor of gender and politics at Sophia University in Tokyo. "The constitution does not rule out same-sex marriage, so an interpretation can be made that it is constitutional," Miura told Bloomberg Business. While Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party "don't like the idea of same-sex marriage, but at the same time the issue is gaining momentum." Conservative groups were vocal in their opposition, with one, known as the Network Pushing for Normalization of Education, telling the Japan Times that granting same-sex couples the same rights as all other Japanese citizens would degrade the "familial system and practice that heterosexual unions have long preserved in human history." While Shibuya's registration system will be a first for Japan, Yodogawa ward in the western Japanese city of Osaka was the first in the nation to recognize and support the LGBT community. In 2013 the ward government pledged to give consideration to the issues that the community faced, and to train staff to accommodate needs specific to LGBT individuals. Journalist Chie Kobayashi contributed reporting from Tokyo.

Article: Sunday's trip to Loftus Road marks Chelsea’s 700th game under the ownership of Roman Abramovich, a period Jose Mourinho says has been positive not only for the club but for English football as a whole. Some would quibble with the second part of that statement, but Mourinho says that too will change. If the first 699 games under Russian rule has established Chelsea at the top of English and European football, Mourinho believes the next 700 will see them supply more players for the English national team as they implement Abramovich’s demand to follow Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules. Sunday's trip to Loftus Road marks Chelsea’s 700th game under the ownership of Roman Abramovich. Abramovich (right) celebrates with Frank Lampard (centre) and John Terry after Chelsea clinch their first Premier League title under his ownership in 2005. The Russian finally got his hands on the Champions League trophy following Chelsea's success in 2012. Mourinho also believes Chelsea’s adherence to FFP — ‘compared with other clubs and owners who didn’t want to play under the rules’, he pointed out in a thinly veiled dig at Manchester City — positions them as standard bearers for the English game. There can certainly be no doubt Chelsea are in a far stronger position than when Abramovich bought the club from Ken Bates for £140m on June 1, 2003. In the intervening 12 years he has spent in the region of £842.9m on transfer fees, winning three Premier Leagues, four FA Cups, three League Cups, one Europa League and one Champions League, but now, Mourinho says, Abramovich’s rule will benefit England as well as Chelsea. Jose Mourinho, seen here with Abramovich in 2004, has has been in charge of Chelsea for almost five of the Russian's 12 seasons at Stamford Bridge. The Blues have won three Premier Leagues, four FA Cups, three League Cups, one Europa League and one Champions League since 2004. ‘He has been good for Chelsea, good for English football, good for European football,’ said Mourinho, who has been in charge for almost five of those 12 seasons. ‘Chelsea after him became strong, a top club in the country and a top club in Europe. I think that’s very, very good. I think it’s important and I think it’s also important the message Mr Abramovich and this club are passing now. ‘The decision to accept the [Financial Fair Play] rules and play under the rules I think is a big decision compared with other clubs and other owners that didn’t accept the rules and didn’t want to play under the rules. Chelsea are in a far stronger position than when Abramovich bought the club from Ken Bates in 2003. ‘Will the next 700 games under him be good for the English national side? I believe so. In the first team, we had some important players in the national team. 'John Terry, Ashley Cole, Joe Cole, Frank Lampard, Wayne Bridge, Shaun Wright-Phillips. We had a nucleus of four, five players that were always in the national team. ‘Now we are going through a period where it’s just about Gary Cahill. But we have some young boys coming into the first-team. Ruben [Loftus-Cheek] is already here. Normally, in a few years they should be there [in the national side].’ Gary Cahill (above) is now Chelsea's only senior England international in the current first team squad. Mourinho believes the likes of Ruben Loftus-Cheek (left) and Dominic Solanke will represent Chelsea and England for years to come. Mourinho did not name them, but Dominic Solanke, Patrick Bamford, Lewis Baker and Isaiah Brown are thought to be highly-rated at Chelsea, who supply many of the players in England’s age-group teams. The question is whether their young English players will be given the chance in the first team at a club who can take a huge step towards the title by winning at QPR today. It is a game Chelsea go into mindful of decisive slips in last season’s title race but with the title firmly in their own hands now, Mourinho is confident no mistakes will be made. Chelsea are on the verge of a domestic double after picking up the Capital One Cup in March. Mourinho has won seven major trophies while in charge of the west London club. He added: ‘Don’t make me remember the game against Sunderland because that was the game which stopped us fighting for the title. I don’t want to speak again about that game. ‘Last season we were depending on others. We needed this team to lose a couple of points here, a couple of points there. This situation is different. ‘Now we are in a position where we can be isolated of everything. We don’t have to be watching Man City against Man United. We don’t have to be waiting for what they are going to do. It’s just us.’ Fabio Borini celebrates scoring the winning goal during Sunderland's 2-1 win against Chelsea last season. Mourinho believes last season's defeat against Sunderland'stopped' Chelsea from fighting for the title.

Article: Jose Mourinho insists Eden Hazard is in a one-horse race to scoop the player of the season award. The Chelsea forward has been outstanding this season and will be a leading contender to claim both the PFA and Football Writers' awards next month. The Belgian will face stiff competition, namely from Tottenham's Harry Kane, but Mourinho claims anyone who tips a player other than Hazard is merely making mischief. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho is backing his forward Eden Hazard (right) to win Player of the Year awards. Mourinho believes that 'it shouldn't even be a debate' that Hazard should claim the top prizes this season. Hazard has been in superb form for Chelsea this season and instrumental to their title charge. Mourinho insists that Hazard will be able to fend off competition from the likes of Spurs' Harry Kane (centre) 'It shouldn't even be a debate,' said Mourinho. 'If somebody throws other names on the table, it's because he wants to sell papers, get more clicks or throw some sand into people's eyes, because this player is by far the best player in the season.' Hazard is likely to feature at Queens Park Rangers on Saturday but Diego Costa will miss four weeks after aggravating a hamstring injury against Burnley last weekend. It means the striker will miss clashes with Manchester United and Arsenal. Mourinho is prepared to risk the availability of Cesc Fabregas and Nemanja Matic — both one booking away from a two-match ban — for the matches against Chelsea's rivals, saying: 'We try not to get a yellow card during the match, to play football. We know (the risks), but the game is a three-point game.' Meanwhile, Chelsea defender Wallace — on loan at Vitesse Arnhem — has been arrested on suspicion of an offence in a nightclub. The Dutch club refused to comment on the nature of the alleged offence, but a police spokesman was quoted by local media stating it was'sexual'. Wallace was later released without charge. Chelsea striker Diego Costa is set to be out of action for four weeks after aggravating a hamstring injury. Mourinho will risk playing Cesc Fabregas for Chelsea's matches with their rivals, despite his yellow card tally.

German ace Gomez has been linked with a move to the Nou Camp, however the 29-year-old insists even the lure of playing alongside the likes of Lionel Messi and Neymar could not tempt him away from the Stadio Artemio Franchi. Gomez, who has scored four league goals so far this season, told Rai Sport: 'I'm in the sights of Barcelona? The rumours do not interest me, I want to stay in Florence. Mario Gomez (right) has committed his future to Fiorentina by insisting he is keen to stay at the Viola. Gomez, pictured against Tottenham, left Bayern Munich to join Fiorentina for over £17million in July 2013. 'I came Fiorentina to win, I have a goal that I have not yet reached.' The striker joined Fiorentina in July 2013 for a fee believed to be in the region of £17.2million.

Article: (CNN)Blue Bell ice cream has temporarily shut down one of its manufacturing plants over the discovery of listeria contamination in a serving of ice cream originating from that plant. Public health officials warned consumers Friday not to eat any Blue Bell-branded products made at the company's Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, plant. That includes 3-ounce servings of Blue Bell ice cream from this plant that went to institutions in containers marked with the letters O, P, Q, R, S or T behind the coding date. The warning by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not affect other Blue Bell ice cream, including other 3-ounce servings, not made at the plant. But Blue Bell has recalled other products. The company is shutting down the Broken Arrow facility "out of an abundance of caution" to search for a possible cause of contamination. It is the third time Blue Bell has taken action in light of a listeria outbreak at a Kansas hospital that served the company's ice cream. Listeria monocytogenes was recently found in a cup of ice cream recovered from the hospital. The cup contaminated with the bacteria was produced at the Broken Arrow plant in April 2014, Blue Bell said. And, according to the CDC, listeria bacteria was found in additional samples of the same product that were recovered from the plant. The bacteria in the hospital sample and the factory sample appeared to match each other genetically, the CDC said. But they did not appear identical to listeria samples taken from patients infected in the Kansas outbreak. In a separate outbreak in Texas, the CDC did find that listeria samples taken from patients who came down with listeriosis between 2010 and 2014 in a hospital that served 3-ounce Blue Bell cups matched the listeria in recovered samples. None of this means the ice cream is the source of either spate of the infections. "Investigation to determine whether these illnesses are related to exposure to Blue Bell products is ongoing," the CDC said. In early March, in light of the Kansas listeria outbreak, Blue Bell recalled a group of products made at a plant in Texas. It later added 3-ounce cup servings to the recall. Five people were infected and three died in the past year in Kansas from listeria that might be linked to Blue Bell Creameries products, according to the CDC. All five of them were hospitalized at the same hospital before developing listeriosis, the CDC said. At least four of them had consumed milkshakes made with Blue Bell ice cream before developing the infection. "We are devastated and know that Blue Bell has to be and can be better than this," Paul Kruse, Blue Bell CEO and president, said in a statement. "Quality and safety have always been our top priorities. We are deeply saddened and concerned for all those who have been affected." The CDC advises that individuals and institutions should check their freezers for the recalled products and throw them away. In a statement on its website, Blue Bell said "this recall in no way includes Blue Bell ice cream half gallons, pints, quarts, 3 gallons or other 3 oz. cups." This has been the first product recall in the 108-year history of Blue Bell Creameries, the company said. Listeriosis is a serious infection caused by eating food contaminated with listeria, and primarily affects the elderly, pregnant women, newborns and people with weakened immune systems, according to the CDC. Symptoms of a listeria infection are fever and muscle aches, sometimes associated with diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. In the United States, an estimated 1,600 people become seriously ill each year, and approximately 16% of these illnesses result in death. Cervical infections caused by listeriosis in pregnant women may result in stillbirth or spontaneous abortion during the second or third trimesters. CNN's Debra Goldschmidt, Amanda Watts and Jacque Wilson contributed to this report.

Article: Siem de Jong played 45 minutes for Newcastle Under 21s on his comeback from a collapsed lung. The 26-year-old made way at the break after coming through the first half of United's 2-0 defeat to Derby County at St James' Park. De Jong has made just one Premier League start since his £6million arrival from Ajax last summer. Newcastle midfielder Siem de Jong played 45 minutes for Peter Beardsley's Under 21 side on Wednesday. Farrend Rawson (third from right) is congratulated by his team-mates after scoring at St James' Park. He tore his thigh muscle in September and was days away from returning in February when, for the second time in two years, he suffered a collapsed lung and underwent surgery. De Jong was expected to miss the remainder of the season but now has an outside chance of featuring in the final six matches. However, on the evidence of a subdued half against the Rams, Sunday's visit of Spurs will almost certainly come too soon. Newcastle striker Adam Armstrong (right) is pulled back by Derby's Max Lowe. Armstrong (left) heads a cross towards Derby's goal but his effort flies wide of the post. Meanwhile, forgotten man Facundo Ferreyra replaced De Jong at the break. The 24-year-old Argentinian striker arrived on a season-long loan from Shakhtar Donetsk last summer but is yet to make his senior debut having been plagued by a string of injuries. Derby's victory arrived courtesy of second-half goals from Alefe Santos and Farrend Rawson.

Article: Arsenal are trying to find a cure for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's persistent groin problems in a bid to prevent surgery. Arsene Wenger revealed the attacking midfielder has suffered a setback in his bid to return from a hamstring strain that has sidelined him since the FA Cup win over Manchester United on March 9. However, it is the recurrence of a long-standing groin problem that has caused the delay in Chamberlain's return to action, not the hamstring. Arsenal are trying to find a cure for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain’s persistent groin problems. Oxlade-Chamberlain has been struggling with an ongoing groin problem for several months. The groin injury has been an ongoing problem for the England international for several months, but he, together with the club's medical staff, have managed it throughout the season. The root cause of the complaint remains unclear, with club doctors trying to establish a permanent cure for the problem. Arsenal are keen to surgery and are exploring other treatment methods to rid the former Southampton man of his groin discomfort. However, the option of an operation isn't being ruled out, though any procedure would only take place in the summer. Arsene Wenger has revealed the attacking midfielder has suffered a setback in his bid to return to fitness. The 21-year-old should play again this season but the fear is that the problem could recur. Oxlade-Chamberlain will miss at least two more weeks, meaning he will not be available for next weekend's FA Cup semi-final against Reading. The 21-year-old should play again this season, but the fear is that the problem could recur. Surgery would mean another busy summer for Oxlade-Chamberlain as he'd be required to complete a rehabilitation programme before pre-season. He was involved in Roy Hodgson's World Cup squad last year, but didn't feature owing to a knee injury. Fitness permitting, Oxlade-Chamberlain is also likely to be part of Hodgson's squad for Euro 2016 at the end of next season. Arsenal are close to signing 16-year-old Maxi Romero from Velez Sarsfield for £4.5million. 'It is taking a bit longer than I thought because he has a groin inflammation,' confirmed Wenger. 'I hope it does not become a long-term problem but he faces a hurdle this week in training. 'We will see if he has recovered, so the end of the week and the start of next week are important to see if he got rid of that inflammation. Meanwhile, Arsenal's chief negotiator Dick Law has flown to Argentina in an attempt to rubber-stamp the £4.5million capture of 16-year-old forward Maxi Romero from Velez Sarsfield. The deal has been held up by third-party ownership issues - and Law has travelled to South America to resolve the problem.

Article: Mark one up for the future of golf over its past and present as 21-year-old Jordan Spieth took the first-day honours with a stunning opening round of 64 on a spectacular day of scoring at the sun-baked 79th Masters. For much of the day it looked as if he might have to share top billing with 34-year-old Justin Rose and 45-year-old Ernie Els, as the Englishman and the South African posted scores of 67 to tie Charley Hoffman, an American representative of the rank and file. Last man out Jason Day would join them in the evening shadows. But by then Spieth had separated himself from the field to become the youngest first-round leader in Masters history with a fabulous run of six birdies in seven holes before adding a wonderful flourish at the 18th, where he brushed in a 25-foot birdie putt. Runner-up on his debut last year, he now owns a three-shot lead going into day two. Jordan Spieth sinks his birdie put on the 18th at Augusta to take a three-shot lead into the second round. Justin Rose made the early running with an impressive five-under-par 67. Rose consoles Gunn Yang after the amateur finished his round on 13 over. Most of the favoured names left Augusta National feeling reasonably content, as Rory McIlroy and defending champion Bubba Watson shot 71, while Dustin Johnson and Masters specialist Phil Mickelson opened with rounds of 70. Whether they will be feeling quite so content at falling so far behind such an awesome talent as the brilliant Texan is another matter. Spieth has barely been off a leader-board all year and there was no chance of him being off this one during this round where he hit flagsticks, holed putts from everywhere and enjoyed the requisite amount of fortune as well as a wayward drive at the 13th bounced off the Georgia pines into the middle of the fairway. It meant when he stood on the par-five 15th tee he was eight under after a scarcely credible 10 single putts on these treacherous greens. At that moment anything seemed possible — even a 62, thereby setting a new standard for scoring in the 155-year history of majors. Only once all day did he act his age and it was here on this risk-reward par five, as he ran up a six. Naturally, Spieth was not about to get greedy. ‘I made a mistake but a 64, my first score in the sixties on this course, I have nothing to complain about,’ he said. A packed crowd watch Rose on the 10th green during the first round. Rose and Charley Hoffman (above) made the early running at Augusta with a 67. South African Ernie Els rolled back the years with a superb 67 on Thursday. Rose in full bloom on day one is a sight as familiar as the glorious azaleas. In nine previous starts Rose has led on three occasions after the first round. Here he equalled his best Masters score, recorded on the opening day in 2004. That year he went on to hold the 36-hole lead as well, while in 2007 he was lying tied second going into the final round, eventually finishing tied fifth. Add all those memories of good days here to the fact he’s now a proven major champion following his US Open triumph in 2013, and there must be the hope this will prove rather more than an excellent opening gambit. Certainly that is how he is seeing it. ‘I’ve learned plenty from those previous occasions, like not getting ahead of yourself,’ he said. ‘I’ve learned that the hard way and now I can’t see any reason why I shouldn’t keep executing the gameplan. You’ve got to believe in yourself, especially when you’re a major winner.’ Els used his ball-striking skills to get out of trouble on the 17th hole during the first round. Rory McIlroy appeared relaxed as he walked down the ninth fairway with Phil Mickelson, right,. McIlroy recovered from a shaky start to finish the first round on one-under-par. Rose wasn’t the only Englishman to prosper, as in-form Paul Casey shot 69. ‘I played with Paul last week and he strikes me as a man with something to prove,’ said Rose. After Greg Norman, Els might be the great hard-luck story when it comes to fabulous players who never quite got it done here. Given how good he was at 25, he represents a cautionary tale for those who believe it inevitable McIlroy will win the Masters one day. Els is still trying, at 45, and what a joy to see one of the great ball-strikers roll back a decade or two rather than the years to post his five-under score. A wonderful eagle three at the 15th was followed by a superlative sand save from a buried lie at the 17th. Only at the last was there a modicum of disappointment. Two putts and it would have been his lowest score in 71 rounds at Augusta. But he took three. McIlroy recovered from a nervously played front nine with some familiar Augusta failings resurfacing as he failed to birdie either par five. Two clunked chip shots at the third and sixth also betrayed a level of tension that illustrated fully the momentous nature of the achievement he is trying to complete in shooting for the career grand slam. American Jordan Spieth celebrates with his caddie Michael Greller on the 18th. Defending champion Bubba Watson struggled to find his rhythm in opening round. Tiger Woods feels the heat with the world No 111 struggling to get under par during the opening round. Woods reacts to a poor chip shot on the third hole as the pressure begins to tell. There were also two encouraging moments during that front nine, however, when he turned what would have been double bogeys in the past into mere bogeys. At the par-five second he drove into a hazard and was staring an ugly seven in the face for openers until he got down in two blows from 100 yards. At the sixth, his mis-hit chip came back down the steep slope but he didn’t panic. He decided to take his putter for the second attempt and got down in two. The value of limiting the damage was emphasised further when he notched his first birdie of the day at the next. On the back nine, it was more like it from the 25-year-old. Over the front nine he had given up three shots on the par fives alone to playing partner Mickelson, but here he got the two birdies on offer at the 13th and the 15th. ‘I left myself in some awkward spots but I holed some good putts on the back nine,’ he said. ‘I was a little nervous on the front nine but mostly just too excited. It was a decent opener.’ The day as a whole was a lot better than that. One to savour, in fact.

Jordan Spieth carded a 64 to claim the lead on -8 after the first round. Jason Day, Ernie Els, Justin Rose and Charley Hoffman three shots behind. Rory McIlroy kept alive his hopes of claiming career grand slam with 71. Injury-hit Tiger Woods recorded a 73 in just his third start of the year.

Article: (CNN)The classic video game "Space Invaders" was developed in Japan back in the late 1970's -- and now their real-life counterparts are the topic of an earnest political discussion in Japan's corridors of power. Luckily, Japanese can sleep soundly in their beds tonight as the government's top military official earnestly revealed that the country's Air Self Defense Force (ASDF) had never encountered an extraterrestrial unidentified flying object. Responding to a query from flamboyant former wrestler-turned-lawmaker Antonio Inoki, Defense Minister Gen Nakatani told the Diet, Japan's parliament, that his jets had, to date, never come across any UFOs from outer space. "When the Air Self Defense Force detects indications of an unidentified flying object that could violate our country's airspace, it scrambles fighter jets if necessary and makes visual observation," Nakatani said. He continued: "They sometimes find birds or flying objects other than aircraft but I don't know of a case of finding an unidentified flying object believed to have come over from anywhere other than Earth." Inoki has appeared in the U.S.-based WWE -- which describes him as "among the most respected men in sports-entertainment" -- and is the founder of the New Japan Pro Wrestling organization. He entered Japan's Upper House for a second stint in politics in 2013. He also famously fought Muhammad Ali in 1976, in one of the first-ever mixed-discipline matches, which would later pave the way for today's wildly popular Mixed Martial Arts contests. Before his return to politics he was a regular fixture on Japanese TV variety shows and has promoted a slew of products, from hot sauce to banks. The maverick politician also traveled to Iraq in 1990 to try to secure the release of Japanese hostages, and has more recently attempted to replicate former NBA star Dennis Rodman's "basketball diplomacy" by staging a wrestling tournament in North Korea. He reportedly converted to Islam in the 1990s, although he says he practices both Islam and Buddhism. The lawmaker, who is universally known in Japan for his colossal chin and once-ever-present red scarf -- these days often replaced with a red necktie -- as much as for his political achievements, had asked a Upper House Budget Committee meeting if aircraft were ever scrambled to meet extraterrestrial threats, and if research was being done into alien visitors, prompting Nakatani's response. Inoki also claims to have seen a UFO with his own eyes, but admitted that he didn't know personally if aliens existed. The exchange wasn't the first time Japanese politicians have discussed the implications of visitors from another planet. In 2007 then-Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba pondered the legal ramifications, under Japan's pacifist constitution, of a defense against an invasion from outer space.

Article: Sport's propensity to play mind games with its protagonists was rarely more obviously stated than after qualifying for the Chinese Grand Prix, when Nico Rosberg cursed his Mercedes team. Hamilton, the world champion, was relaxed and delighted having taken pole but Rosberg, his team-mate, was grim-faced, demoralised and made his first public criticism of his team. Nico Rosberg will start behind pole-sitter Lewis Hamilton with Sebastian Vettel third on the grid in China. Rosberg cut a frustrated figure in the paddock after he missed out on pole to Hamilton by just 0.042secs. Rosberg was only four-hundredths of a second behind the Briton and will start second on the grid. Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari is third, nearly a second adrift of Hamilton. But Rosberg was visibly angry after the Mercedes pit-wall brains put him under unnecessary ‘pressure’. The German was the last driver out for his final flying lap, meaning he had to rush to get in a competitive time. Rosberg, who is customarily gracious in defeat, fell slightly short of Hamilton’s mark and was grumpy afterwards. He said: ‘It was not ideal to put me under pressure like that. I don’t think it cost me anything, but even the mind-set to know that I have to speed up a bit — we need to look into that. Sparks fly off the back of Rosberg's Mercedes during qualifying for Sunday's race in Shanghai. The German has now been out-qualified by Hamilton at each of the three races this season. ‘Other than that the lap was good  and it is very annoying as the lap is never perfect, so four hundredths is always in it. Tyre degradation is going to be a big issue for the race as we are going to take the tyres right to the limit. So there are many opportunities.’ Poor old Rosberg was cock of the walk in the early and middle parts of last season, but he seems terribly lacklustre since Hamilton won the title. Even his Mercedes boss, Niki Lauda, said he should ‘sort himself out’ — a statement on Rosberg’s psyche rather than his work ethic. Whether he has the speed to match Hamilton may be at the centre of his anger. The Briton set his fastest time on his penultimate lap. It was enough. Rosberg, though, got closer to Hamilton than he has recently. McLaren will again be towards the back of the grid with Jenson Button 17th and Fernando Alonso 18th. Barely a hair’s breadth separated the former champions. Button said: ‘I guess we hoped we might be just a bit closer than we were today. In practice, we’d looked a bit more competitive, certainly. ‘We’d found a reasonably good balance with the car, in fact, but the lap-time isn’t quite there yet.’ Hamilton will start from the front of the pack as he bids to win his fourth grand prix in China.

Nico Rosberg was the last driver out of the pit-lane and was forced to turn in a quicker out-lap than he would have liked ahead of his final shot at pole. The German narrowly lost out  to his team-mate Lewis Hamilton. Rosberg was just 0.042secs slower than his Mercedes rival. Rosberg also said: 'Oh, come on, guys', over the team radio after he was informed he'd missed out on pole for Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix.

Players are able to vote in the end-of-season awards for the first time, with titles such as 'Man of the Year' being handed out,. But while they may not be able to vote for themselves, James seems to think his influence with the Cavaliers deserves recognition. LeBron James seems to have decided who deserves the NBA MVP award at the end of the season. LeBron goes up for a slam dunk (left) during the victory against the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday night. When asked  who would his vote be for MVP this year by ESPN, James replied'myself', before adding: 'Guys are going to be able to recognise the guys they play against every night and what they do for their franchises.'

Article: Stuart McCall expects Shane Ferguson to be fit and ready to aid Rangers’ play-off push towards the Premiership. The Northern Ireland international finally joined up with his Ibrox team-mates this week, more than two months after he was one of five Newcastle players sent north on loan to the Championship side. Ferguson has not played since his country’s 2-0 European qualifier win over Greece in Athens in October and the 23-year-old’s knee injury had been expected to keep him out for the season. Rangers manager Stuart McCall takes a training session at Murray Park on Tuesday morning. But McCall revealed: ‘Shane’s been out for five months but the good thing about him is his mental state. I spoke to him on Monday and I was really impressed. Do I get the impression he is he is here to play? Yes, definitely. ‘I liked the way he was talking, he wants to get straight into it. He’s a naturally fit lad and he seems really focused too, so that was pleasing. ‘He trained really hard on Monday and on Tuesday and he’s on his way to a quick recovery, which would be positive news for us. ‘If our Under-20 game (against Dundee United on Tuesday) had not been on astro turf, he might have got an hour under his belt. ‘But if you’ve been out that long you’re going to need four to six weeks to get back on track. So he certainly won’t be ready in the next two weeks but hopefully he will play his part in the back end of the season.” Newcastle United loanee Shane Ferguson takes part in the training session. Rangers were controversially loaned players from Newcastle in January, when St James’ Park and Sports Direct supremo Mike Ashley was still calling the shots in the Ibrox boardroom ahead of the Dave King-led takeover. Then-manager Kenny McDowall sensationally revealed he had been ordered to play all five when fit. But with Rangers believed not to have carried out medicals, Kevin Mbabu and Ferguson have not featured through injury and fitness, while Gael Bigirimana is believed to have a blood disorder. Defender Remie Street went off injured after 44 minutes of his debut and has not been seen since,. Only Slovenian Haris Vuckic has been a success, scoring six goals in his last seven games. But McCall now hopes he can call on a player who impressed last summer in friendlies for Northern Ireland against Chile and Uruguay. ‘I’ve spoken to a couple of lads like Dean Shiels, who know Shane from Northern Ireland, and it’s all positive,’ said McCall. ‘I also spoke to Northern Ireland manager Michael O’Neill about him. He’s filled in at left-back for them but probably his best position is one up on the left. He’s certainly a good crosser of the ball, he’s shown that in the sessions we have done. Ferguson (right) finally joined up with the Rangers squad in Glasgow this week. ‘I went through his Wikipedia last night and I think he’s played 23 games for Newcastle in the Premier and 30 for Birmingham. You don’t play that number unless you’ve got something about you.’ Rangers must pay Newcastle an extra £500,000 over and above wages for the loan players if they go up through the play-offs but McCall would be delighted if that happens. ‘It was a surprise to everyone when the news about that came out, because it’s quite a lot of money, especially when only one of the (loan players) is playing,’ said McCall. ‘But if it was me - and it’s not because it’s not my money - I’d love to give Newcastle £500,000 because that means we have got promotion.’ Defender Darren McGregor echoed his manager’s views and insisted that promotion was all that mattered after what has been a roller-coaster season. Rangers defender Darren McGregor trains as the club look to claim promotion to the Scottish Premiership. ‘A lot of fans would accept it has been a bad year and all the boys will hold their hands up and say it has not been good enough,’ said the 29-year-old. ‘But if we do get promoted, it would be seen as a successful season. I know that’s quite hard to comprehend but from where we were a couple of months ago, to actually get up would be good. ‘Winning the league would have been great but the aim was always to get promotion. And the way the season has panned out for us, it will now need to be through the play offs.’ Hibs and Rangers are currently locked on 61 points, with Wednesday's match at Livingston representing the Ibrox side’s game in hand. The Easter Road club have a better goal difference of +2 but McGregor is happy that Rangers remain in control of their destiny with Dumbarton away and Falkirk at Ibrox their remaining two matches after their visit to the Energy Assets Arena on Wednsday. Rangers players prepare for the trip to bottom-of-the-table Livingston on Wednesday night. ‘We know our goal difference is short at the moment, but we also know if we keep winning game it’s in our hands to finish second,’ said McGregor. ‘If we beat Livingston, we are three points clear. ‘We want to finish second because that would give us one week more preparation for the play-offs. So we want to win every game until the end of the season. ‘We’ve shown a glimmer of what we are capable of lately and we need to bottle that and take it to Livvy.’

Article: (CNN)Residents of central Sanaa, the Yemeni capital, have learned the hard way that key strategic bombing targets are located in their neighborhoods: Detonating ordnance has been shattering their windows and doors. And fighting has killed hundreds of people in less than two weeks. The Saudi-led coalition smashed parts of Yemen's Defense Ministry Central Command in the capital over the weekend, senior Yemeni officials said. Under the rain of coalition bombs, the Houthis, who are Shiites in a majority Sunni country, still control Sanaa. But the airstrikes have hurt them and destroyed a lot of infrastructure. The electricity has gone out on 16 million Yemenis living in Houthi-held areas, the Yemeni officials said. Many fear they will lose access to clean water as well. Yemen's deposed President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi heaped scorn on top of the airstrikes. He fired his former Army chief of staff, Hussein Khairan, on Sunday. The firing had no practical effect, since Khairan had switched sides weeks ago and is the Houthi rebels' acting defense minister. Hadi is holed up in Saudi Arabia, which is working to defeat his enemies and reinstall him. Fighting has ended dozens of lives each day. On Monday, more than 50 people died in the port city of Aden alone, where Houthis and their allies are battling troops loyal to Hadi on the ground, Agence France-Press reported. Since the bombing campaign and intense fighting began just over a week ago, some 600 people are estimated to have been killed. Many more have been wounded, and tens of thousands have fled the country. The International Committee of the Red Cross has cried out for a humanitarian ceasefire to let aid in. "Otherwise, put starkly, many more people will die. For the wounded, their chances of survival depend on action within hours, not days," said Robert Mardini, the ICRC's head of operations in the Near and Middle East. "Medical supplies need to be here yesterday," said ICRC spokeswoman Marie-Claire Feghali from Sanaa. "We need to save the lives that can be saved." Saudi Arabia signed off on letting the ICRC into Yemen via two aircraft -- one with medical supplies, the other with workers. But flying in will be hard, since most airlines have canceled their flights, and airstrikes have taken out many airfields. On Monday, the flight loaded with 48 tons of medical supplies was grounded in Djibouti, Feghali said. The ICRC is hoping to fly out in a day or two. Following the ICRC's call, on Saturday the U.N. Security Council discussed the humanitarian situation at Russia's behest. Moscow submitted a draft resolution calling for a halt to the airstrikes by the nine-country regional coalition. The meeting adjourned with no decision announced. One diplomat said the draft was missing key elements. It didn't call for the Houthis to stop fighting or for political talks between the belligerents, the diplomat told CNN on condition of anonymity. Yemen has been descending into chaos in the weeks since Houthi rebels -- who have long complained of being marginalized in the majority Sunni country -- forced Hadi from power. The Houthis put Hadi under house arrest when they overtook Sanaa in January. But Hadi escaped in February, fled to Aden and declared himself to still be president. Houthis and their allies, including those loyal to Hadi's predecessor, then fought Hadi's forces in the Aden area. Hadi fled Aden in late March, ultimately for Saudi Arabia, when the rebels and their military allies advanced on the city. The conflict prompted Saudi Arabia, a predominately Sunni nation and Yemen's northern neighbor, and other Arab nations to intervene with force. The Houthis are allied with Iran, Saudi Arabia's bitter rival across the Persian Gulf, and Riyadh does not want an proxy of Iran in power on its border. Complicating matters in Yemen is the fact that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula -- not the Houthis or the forces loyal to Hadi -- holds sway in the country's east. AQAP is considered one of the most ruthless branches of the terrorist organization. It has taken advantage of the chaos to overrun one city and break prisoners out of jail. Hadi's government had cooperated with the United States to fight AQAP, but with the Houthi takeover, that arrangement has evaporated, and the terror group operates generally unchecked.

Article: A youngster admiring his catch was left surprised when the fish jumped up and slapped him in the face. Quinn Patrick was on a fishing trip with his dad at Snow Lake, Indiana when the pair caught a bowfin, videoed lying lifeless on a concrete dock. Crouching over the fish, Quinn deliberates whether someone should put it back in the water. When suddenly the Bowfin propels itself from the ground and slaps the youngster straight in the face with its large tail. The sound of the fish making impact with the youngster’s face is not dissimilar to a sound effect used in a cartoon. Recoiling, Quinn stumbles backwards in shock as his dad begins laughing – prompting the youngster to laugh along with him. Quinn Patrick was on a fishing trip with his dad at Snow Lake, Indiana when the pair caught a Bowfin. The young boy then states: ‘Dad there’s blood on him,’ and his father replies by gently explaining that the fish got hurt. Worried, the youngster replies rather sweetly: ‘By me?’ Before his dad reassures him that he is not to blame. The video concludes with the father discussing the size of the Bowfin’s teeth. The Bowfin propels itself from the ground and slaps the youngster straight in the face with its large tail. Bowfin are native to North America and are commonly found in east America, south Ontario and Quebec. They are demersal freshwater fish, which means they live and feed at the bottom of lakes and seas. And are piscivore, which means they are carnivorous and predominately eat other fish. Common names for the fish include mudfish, dogfish, mud pike, griddle, grinnel, cypress trout and choupique. The sound of the fish making impact with the youngster’s face is not dissimilar to a sound effect used in a cartoon.

Article: Dundee have vowed to stand by Paul McGowan after the bad boy midfielder was spared jail for a third assault on a policeman. But the Dens Park bad boy will miss two forthcoming games against former club Celtic because he is under house arrest. The 27-year-old has been placed on a 16-week restriction of liberty order which confines him to home between the hours of 7pm and 7am. And the Dark Blues face Ronny Deila's night next Wednesday night – before a Friday night trip to Parkhead on May 1. McGowan was handed his third conviction for assaulting a police officer at Airdrie Sheriff Court. As a St Mirren player he was sentenced to 130 hours of unpaid work and handed a one-year supervision order in January 2014 after admitting kicking two officers. The court heard McGowan 'charged towards' two police officers after a disturbance in Airdrie in the early hours of November 23 last year. He later kicked another officer on the body while being detained at Coatbridge police station. Paul McGowan avoided a prison sentence after a third assault on a policeman. Sheriff Derek O'Carroll spared the Dens star a prison sentence after hearing he had was undergoing counselling through PFA Scotland, the players' union, for a gambling problem in addition to social work sessions. In a statement Dundee vowed to support their player through his problems saying: 'The club does not condone the behaviour which has led to this and wouldn't from any member of our staff. 'We fully respect the decision made by the court and Dundee FC will be standing by the player. 'Paul is an integral part of the club and we will be working alongside the PFA with him as he bids to positively resolve his off the field issues. 'With the support of his manager, his teammates and club staff we hope Paul will be able to move forward and be part of another successful season next year at Dens Park. 'The club will be making no further comment on the matter.' His solicitor, Liam O'Donnell, told the court that social work reports 'finally give some indication that the accused is getting it in terms of his offending. He added: 'He was not in any trouble from the age of 16 to 23. At age 23 he separated from his partner. The reason he separated has been attributed to an underlying gambling problem. The 27-year-old Dundee midfielder pictured in action against Dundee United last week. 'This gambling problem seems to be the root of his offending. When he takes alcohol his anger about the gambling problem seems to come out through aggression.' O'Donnell revealed the former St Mirren player was undergoing voluntary counselling each week through the Paisley-based RCA Trust, which helps people with alcohol and gambling addictions. 'He is fully supported by his club,' he added. 'The managing director of Dundee Football Club is present in court to indicate his support because he is addressing matters.' After listening to the address, Sheriff O'Carroll reminded McGowan of the previous occasions he had been convicted of offences, in 2010 and 2013. 'And here you are again facing similar charges,' O'Carroll added. 'It's quite correct to say that you are on the cusp of custody and certainly that's in the thoughts of the court.' However, he proceeded to sentence McGowan to the tagging order provided he continues with the counselling. 'If you breach the order you will be brought back here and I have already advised you what the outcome will be,' the sheriff added. Dundee managing director John Nelms, who was accompanied in court by players including captain James McPake, declined to answer questions outside court. McGowan also declined to comment but O'Donnell said afterwards: 'He is relieved with the outcome and he knows he needs to modify his behaviour. He appreciates the support of his club and others.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Paul McGowan avoided a jail sentence after police attack. Midfielder under house arrest and will miss two games against Celtic. The 27-year-old is on a 16-week restriction of liberty order.

Article: James McClean's reaction said it all. As Scott Carson's long, hopeful punt downfield floated harmlessly out of play, the talented winger spun in disgust, shook his head and threw open his arms. Wigan are better than this, and they know it. They were 2-1 down at that point, two moments of genius from Ross McCormack and Matt Smith the difference. They rallied to come away from Fulham with a point - it was a night in which new manager Gary Caldwell certainly saw enough to build on - but all at the club know their stay in the Championship is unlikely to be extended beyond May. It is an infuriating situation, the damage inflicted by an ultimately doomed appointment of Malky Mackay incurable this season. Fulham captain Scott Parker (right) is hassled for the ball by Wigan's Gaetan Bong (left) at Craven Cottage. Fulham striker Ross McCormack lets fly with a shot to score his side's opening goal against Wigan on Friday. The ever industrious Parker (left) dribbles away from the challenge of Wigan's Kim Bo-Kyung (right) Wigan winger Jermaine Pennant (left) scores a stunning free-kick to level the scores 1-1 against Fulham. FULHAM (4-4-2): Bettinelli, Grimmer, Turner, Burn, Husband, Hoogland, Tunnicliffe, Parker, Kavanagh (Ruiz 73), Smith (Woodrow 63) McCormack (Stafylidis 94) Subs not used: Kiraly, Hutchinson, Kacaniklic, Rodallega. Booked: Burn, Kavanagh. Scorers: McCormack 4, Smith 35. WIGAN (4-1-4-1): Carson, Boyce (McCann 70), Maguire, Pearce, Bong, Kvist, Perch, Pennant (Murphy 84), McClean, Kim Bo-kyung, Fortune (Waghorn 57) Subs not used: Mckay, Ojo, Barnett, Al Habsi. Scorers: Pennant 22, Pearce 69. Referee: Mick Russell. Attendance: 15,994. Caldwell must hope he has the character to build next year if they do fail to perform the improbable and remain in this division. Seven points is now the difference, Wigan having played at least a game more than their rivals with just four games to play. Their band of supporters in one corner of Craven Cottage recognise this is not the fault of Caldwell and are actually excited about what the future may hold. No Malky, no problem. But as McClean's annoyance indicates, they are all too aware that this impending relegation should not have been allowed to happen. The frustration is that their squad is more than capable of challenging under the right guidance, but probably won't have the opportunity to do so. Wigan showed guts and dug in for Caldwell, whose more patient style in possession was referenced by the Latics' official Twitter account midway through this. It felt like a sly dig to his predecessor. Matt Smith scores Fulham's second goal to restore their lead against Wigan at Carven Cottage on Friday. Smith slides to his knees as he celebrates putting the home side back in front in the Championship match. And to come from behind twice shows qualities they just did not possess under Mackay. Caldwell, a rugged central defender, will be unhappy with the ease with which McCormack opened the scoring after just four minutes; Harry Maguire's header was a poor one, straight into the path of Sean Kavanagh, who fed the Scot and he was afforded the time to pick a spot and curl beyond Scott Carson. In a game lacking genuine chances, there were then two moments of real class. Firstly Jermaine Pennant levelled for Wigan, bending a wicked 25-yard free-kick away from the despairing Marcus Bettinelli. He ran the full length of the pitch to celebrate in front of the travelling hundreds. Wigan utility player James Perch (left) jumps for the ball and is challenged by Fulham's Sean Kavanagh (right) But anything the winger could do, lanky Smith would match. Fulham's target man - again in too much space - looked up from the same distance and marvellously clipped over Carson to net just his third goal for the club since a summer move from Leeds. Those flashes from the front two rather masked what was a disjointed display by the Cottagers, still smarting from their derby humiliation against Brentford last week. Fans were furious at Kit Symons' lack of tactical imagination, further compounded when Jason Pearce gambled at the back post to equalise for the visitors in the 69th minute. Smith had been taken off six minutes previously to a chorus of boos and chants of 'you don't know what you're doing' rained down on Symons. The same when McCormack was hooked for defender Kostas Stafylidis. Much like against Brentford, Fulham's paying customers did not shirk away from telling him exactly what they thought. These are testing times for Symons, whose relationship with the fans is at its lowest ebb since he took over earlier this season. How he must've prayed Scott Parker didn't fluff his lines in stoppage time. Compare that to Wigan who, even though they will almost definitely join Blackpool in League One, are pulling in the same direction. Their new chairman David Sharpe, grandson of Dave Whelan, spoke of a long-term vision on appointing Caldwell on Tuesday, and that is something which has galvanised the place. Had Pennant's late header not been superbly blocked by Dan Burn, the talk might have been of an unlikeliest of survival miracles. Wigan's Jason Pearce (right) is congratulated by Pennant (left) as he scores the second equaliser for his side.

Wigan twice came from behind to force a draw. Ross McCormack gave Fulham an early lead on four minutes. Jermaine Pennant equalised for Wigan with a stunning free-kick. Matt Smith restored Fulham's lead before half-time. Jason Pearce pulled the visitors level from a corner after the restart.

Article: (CNN)Film director David Lynch has confirmed he will no longer direct the revival of "Twin Peaks" -- a cult 1990s television show that was set to return in 2016. The offbeat TV series, created by Lynch and Mark Frost, featured a quirky FBI agent who went to the Pacific Northwest town of Twin Peaks to investigate the mysterious murder of a high school girl named Laura Palmer. The groundbreaking series is considered one of the most influential shows in television history. Lynch broke the news about his departure in a series of tweets, saying that the show's third season will continue without him. He said he felt the network was not offering enough money to produce the show "the way it needed to be done." Lynch also wrote that he had personally called the actors over the weekend to let them know he would no longer be directing. Showtime Network, which will air the nine-episode comeback, released a statement saying they were "saddened" by Lynch's decision. "We were saddened to read David Lynch's statement today since we believed we were working towards solutions with David and his reps on the few remaining deal points," read the statement. "Showtime also loves the world of Twin Peaks and we continue to hold out hope that we can bring it back in all its glory with both of its extraordinary creators, David Lynch and Mark Frost, at its helm." Showtime announced they would produce a third season in October last year. Actor Kyle MacLachlan, who played the coffee-obsessed FBI agent Dale Cooper in the original series, had confirmed he would reprise the lead role for the new season.

Article: Graeme McDowell insisted he would never consider not playing the Masters despite another frustrating experience at Augusta National. McDowell carded a final round of 73 on Sunday to finish six over par and is now a combined 24 over for his eight appearances in the year's first major championship. 'I can't imagine not coming here,' the former US Open champion said. 'It would be sacrilege not to play here no matter how much it frustrates you as you have to enjoy it for what it is. Graeme McDowell tees off on the third hole during the third round at Augusta on Saturday. 'It is a celebration of golf on my favourite golf course in the world. It is. I love it. But it's unrequited. 'Once I feel like I have got one up on this course it takes two back. I walk away still disappointed a little that I can't score as well as I feel I should round this course. I threw away shots like confetti all week. 'I think it's a puzzle you can solve. I realised my style of putting is not suited to Augusta. I'm going to have to work on a type of speed putting that's going to be suitable. McDowell carded a final round of 73 on Sunday to finish six over par for the tournament. 'You have to be a 'front-edge' putter like Bubba (Watson), I've never seen anyone roll in putts from six feet slower than Bubba. You have to drop them in and I have to adapt to do that round here.' McDowell's score could have been even worse after he was initially given a one-shot penalty for moving his marker as he attempted to swat a bee away from his ball on the third green. However, European Tour chief referee John Paramor rescinded the penalty a few holes later and McDowell added: 'I said could he follow me the rest of the day because he was the first guy who has saved me a shot in a while.' It would be sacrilege not to play here no matter how much it frustrates you,' McDowell said on Sunday.

As his team-mates roared wildly around him Lewandowski did not celebrate against his former club. 'The first 10 minutes were completely fine,' Klopp told Sky.

Article: By the time Andy Murray ties the knot next Saturday he will hopefully have forgotten the utter frustration at becoming Novak Djokovic's Easter bunny. The 27-year-old Scot has lost his last seven matches to the Serb, this one the Miami Open final 7-6 4-6 6-0 on a brutally punishing afternoon, suffering the undeserving ignominy of conceding another love set against his old rival. He pushed him hard and had enough early chances to have won it in straight sets. In fact Murray pushed Djokovic so hard that, at the end of the second set, the furious Serb wrenched his towel off a startled ballkid and screamed at his box on his way to the chair, gaining a warning as his mask of statesmanship slipped. Novak Djokovic raises his arms aloft after claiming victory over Andy Murray 7-6 4-6 6-0 in the Miami Open. Djokovic poses with the Butch Buchholz trophy on the beach at Key Biscayne after his Miami Open win. The Serb gives the thumbs up as he shows off the glass trophy on the beach in Miami. The Serbian world No 1 jumps for joy as he celebrates his success over Andy Murray in the final. Djokovic kisses his fifth Miami Open winner's trophy after an emphatic finish to the match on Sunday. A deflated Murray holds his runners-up trophy alongside Djokovic after the pair battle the heat of Florida. A fired-up Djokovic battled to a three-set victory over Murray for his fifth Miami Open winner's trophy. Djokovic snatches his towel from a ball boy at the end of the second set, claimed by Murray. The Serbian yells after Murray broke his serve to claim the second set and take the match to a decider. Murray has had a good enough week to walk down the aisle with Kim Sears having got back to world No 3, but it is now ten out of eleven defeats against the world No 1. How to seize the moment against this phenomenal competitor is a hugely pressing issue for him and everyone else. As for Djokovic, he will now be holding that distinction for the 141st week of his career on Monday, putting him on sixth equal in the all-time list with Rafael Nadal. In some ways this was a truncated version of their Australian Open final. A forlorn Murray reflected afterwards: 'Game wise, I feel like in the couple of the matches we played this year I've been able to hang with him, but just not quite for long enough unfortunately. Murray celebrates his first break of Djokovic's serve in the opening set at Crandon Park Tennis Center. World No 1 Djokovic powers a forehand back at the Scotsman during their clash in Key Biscayne, Florida. Murray plays a slice backhand during a tight first set that included four breaks of serve before the tie-break. Murray takes a moment in the shade as the Miami sun beams down on the finalists. Djokovic (left) and Murray launch into a forehand and backhand respectively as they battle it out in Miami. 'I need to try to work out why that is. I played well for two sets and was struggling physically in the third. I don't feel like I can do loads more than what I'm doing to get myself in the best condition possible, I do push myself very hard.' The first set was notable for Murray's early aggression that brought him a break in the third game and should have seen him open up a 3-1 lead. But it transpired that it was desperately difficult playing into the fierce lunchtime sun. Nobody actually held at the city end of the court until the eleventh game when the Serb managed it. Murray forced the tiebreak but, beginning on the more difficult side, could not recover from 0-4 down as he hit several forehands long. Djokovic dives desperately at the net as the first set goes the distance in the blazing heat. Murray shows his frustration as his two breaks in the first set are immediately countered by the Serbian. Both stars struggled serving into the sun with all four breaks in the first set coming from the same end. Djokovic had been starting to blow hard – rather like he did in Australia – and just like in Melbourne it all proved to be irrelevant as he took it 7-3. Gauging how the 27 year-old Serb is feeling is an extremely inexact science, and you could only speculate as a brutally punishing second set unfolded in more level fashion than the break-filled opener. Murray became more and more agitated as he failed to gain the breakthrough but held on until 5-4 when Djokovic dissolved into a ball of Balkan anger. Murray broke him to love and the Serb angrily snatched his towel off the ballboy, apologising later:'I'm sorry, because I didn't pay attention to the ball boy and I just screamed at my box,' he said.

There was also a volley of abuse, Murray style, towards Boris Becker and his support team up in the box, but it only seemed to galvanise Djokovic. Murray had to hold at the start of the decider to set him on his way to what would have been a massive victory in the context of his season, the first time he had won a Masters level event since his Wimbledon triumph of 2013. The first three games of the decider were long and hard before – helped by some wonky Murray overheads – Djokovic just cracked his opponent's body and spirit.

Article: Queens Park Rangers manager Chris Ramsey has revealed he will have no problem shaking John Terry’s hand in light of the racist comments the former England captain directed at former Rs defender Anton Ferdinand four years ago. Terry, who will line up against Ramsey’s side, was banned for four games and fined £220,000 for the remarks made in October 2011 during Chelsea’s 1-0 defeat at Loftus Road. But Ramsey, the Premier League’s only black manager, thinks the issue has been dealt with. ‘Ultimately, John Terry is a player of Chelsea. I am a manager of QPR. As a man, as a person, I would shake his hand,’ Ramsey said. ‘I don’t know what his feelings are towards me. As long as there wasn’t anything on the field that was unprofessional by him, I would shake his hand. Queens Park Rangers manager Chris Ramsey speaks to the media on Friday ahead of the Chelsea match. Chelsea captain John Terry controls the ball during last weekend's Premier League match against Stoke. Ramsey arrives for Friday's pre-match press conference as QPR prepare to host Chelsea at Loftus Road. ‘The whole episode for British society sat uncomfortably. It’s not something we want to highlight in football. It happened and it’s being dealt with. We have to move on. And hopefully everyone has learned something from it.’ Ramsey revealed that Rio Ferdinand, who labelled Terry an idiot for the abuse aimed at his brother, won’t be fit in time for a reunion with the Chelsea skipper this weekend. But the 52-year-old suspects his player’s one-time England colleague will be on the receiving end of a hostile welcome from the home fans on his return the scene of the unsavoury incident. 'Rio has unfortunately got an injury, he’s had a knock, and it’s recurring, he keeps trying to train,' Ramsey continued. 'He will train this morning. He’s something we miss immensely. We miss his leadership qualities on the pitch. Unfortunately, he won't be involved in the game. ‘Fans are fans, aren’t they? (Terry’s return) is a subject that brings up a lot of different emotions. So it would be odd to think that there isn’t going to be an extra feeling towards that situation.’ QPR defender Anton Ferdinand avoids shaking hands with Terry before a league match in September 2012. Ferdinand and Terry argue during QPR's 1-0 victory against Chelsea at Loftus Road in October 2011. Rio Ferdinand, brother of Anton, will not be fit for Sunday's match against Chelsea.

Article: A group of black attorneys have called for the second officer connected to the fatal shooting of South Carolina father Walter Scott to be arrested. National Bar Association officials said that Officer Clarence Habersham, 37, who was the second policeman to arrive at the dead man's body after shooter Michael Slager, should be fired and prosecuted for filing a false report. The call comes after Slager, who has been fired from the North Charleston police and charged with murder last week, is thought to have falsified reports on the circumstances that led to Scott's death. Warning: Graphic Content Below. Scroll down for video. The National Bar Association is calling for North Chareston officer Clarence Habersham, 37 (right) to be arrested for falsifying a report about the actions of  Michael Slager, 33 (left), during the death of Walter Scott. Habersham (right) was the second office to arrive at the body of Scott, 50, and did not report Slager's actions leading up to the shooting. Scott, 50, a Coast Guard veteran,  was pulled over for a broken tail light last Saturday by Slager, who shot him five times in the back as he ran away from the traffic stop. The father of four's death sparked nationwide debate about police brutality and bias against black people after a witness published video contradicting the police account of the event. Slager, 33, who is white, said that he felt 'threatened' by Scott, who is black, during a confrontation over his Taser, but video shows the civilian running away before being shot. Habersham, who approached the body after Slager went to go grab the Taser that fell, can be seen examining Scott. Slager then drops the Taser next to the dead body in the presence of Habersham. Habersham then used his radio to report that Scott had gunshot wounds to his chest, right side, and backside. However, the black officer gave a two-sentence supplemental report and said that he tried to render aid to the body, which no one in the video does. On April 4, 2015 I Officer Habersham responded to the empty Lot behind Mega Pawn in reference to the above incident. I (Habersham) attempted to render aid to the victim by applying pressure to the gunshot wounds and directing the best route for EMS and fire to take to get to the victim faster. Video released after Slager's account into the death shows Scott (left) running away from the traffic stop when he is shot. Mourners have placed flowers at a memorial to the veteran (right) over the past week. Slager said after the incident that he 'felt threatened' by Scott, though video shot by Feidin Santana contradicts his report. Officers in the video are seen walking around and checking the pulse of the body. Sergeant James Gann wrote in his report that he helped Habersham administer first aid and CPR.. Feidin Santana, who filmed a widely circulated video of the incident, said he did not any officers giving Scott CPR. The National Bar Association, the country's oldest group of black lawyers, said that Habersham 'deliberately left material facts out of his report' and left it 'incomplete'. The group said it was 'outraged' by the incident and that any other officer of the seven that quickly arrived on the scene should be indicted if they filed a false report. Police are interviewing all officers involved, a police source told CBS News. Chief Eddie Driggers said that he would not comment because the investigation is ongoing. POLICE VERSION. Police officer Michael Slager said in a statement earlier this week that his encounter with Walter Scott began at around 9.30am on Saturday. He said he pulled Scott's Mercedes over as a routine traffic stop for a broken brake light. He said Scott then ran away into a vacant grassy lot where, at some point during the chase, the victim confronts Slager. The officer then tried to use his Taser to subdue Scott, but claims the suspect grabbed the stun gun during the struggle, according to the statement. According to police reports, Slager fired the stun gun, but it did not stop Scott. At that point, the officer fired at Scott several times because he 'felt threatened,' Slager's statement said. He added that his actions were in line with procedure. Police then said Slager reported on his radio moments after the struggle: 'Shots fired and the subject is down. He took my Taser.' His department said the officers then performed CPR and delivered first aid to the victim. WHAT THE VIDEO SHOWS. Slager's account has been called into question after the video appears to show him shooting Scott in the back. The footage begins in the vacant lot apparently moments after Slager fires his Taser. Wires which administer the electrical current appear to be extending from Scott's body. As Scott turns to run, Slager draws his pistol and, only when he is 15 to 20 feet away, starts to fire the first of the eight shots at his back. The video shows Slager handcuffing Scott's lifeless body. Footage then appears to show Slager jogging back to the point where the Taser fell to the ground, bringing it over to Scott's body around 30 feet away and dropping it next to him. It is only after two-and-a-half minutes that Slager is seen placing his hand on Scott's neck in an apparent attempt to check his pulse. A black colleague then arrives and puts on blue medical gloves before handling the body, but is not seen performing first aid. They are joined by a third officer, who also does not appear to tend to the victim. Relatives of Scott say their goodbyes to him on Saturday at a funeral that was was so widely attended that hundreds were left outside. Habersham was accused of excessive force by another black South Carolina resident, Sheldon Williams, 47, according to the Guardian. Williams, who has multiple criminal convictions, said that he was pinned to the ground, handcuffed and had his face stomped on during a 2011 arrest. He said he did not resist arrest. Scott was laid to rest today, his casket draped in an American flag and accompanied by his distraught mother. So many people came to the service that hundreds were left waiting outside. US senator Tim Scott (R-SC), Congressman Jim Clyburn (D-SC), state senator Marlon Kimpson, Charleston County Sheriff Al Cannon, and Elder James Johnson of the National Action Network all attended. Slager is being held without bail and faces punishments as serious as the death penalty if convicted. Judy Scott, the mother of Walter, leaves the funeral for her son in Charleston, South Carolina. The service was also attended by a number of the state's politcians. Scott, who was remembered as a beloved father, had his coffin draped in an American flag during Saturday's funeral ceremony.

Article: Ferrari, who are Ferrari? Lewis Hamilton sauntered to pole position for the Malaysian Grand Prix, nearly one second ahead of Sebastian Vettel’s third-fastest Ferrari. That said, Ferrari are stronger over a long run and may yet provide a threat to Hamilton’s supremacy. Hamilton was four-hundredths of a second ahead of his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg – ‘the blink of an eyelid’, as he, the German described it. Rosberg will start second. Lewis Hamilton waves to the crowd after claiming pole for the Chinese Grand Prix. He will start ahead of Nico Rosberg and Sebastian Vettel.

'Come on, guys,' he moaned over the team radio after he was informed he'd missed out on pole. Hamilton was relaxed. Vettel was downcast, but said that the race may be a different story from qualifying. Hamilton set his fastest time on his penultimate lap. It was enough. Rosberg, though, got closer to Hamilton than he has recently, perhaps heeding the advice of Niki Lauda, his team chairman, who told him via Sportsmail to ‘sort himself out’. McLaren will be towards the back of the grid. Jenson Button will start 17th and Fernando Alonso 18th. Barely a hair’s breadth separated the two former champions. A naturally disappointed Button said: 'The car didn't feel bad so it's interesting when you find a good balance but the lap time is not there. We've made good improvements this weekend, but qualifying just wasn't for us. 'Hopefully we'll be racing the cars in front tomorrow, but we hoped to be competing with them in qualifying as well.' Sebastian Vettel qualified third but could threaten Hamilton's supremacy with the Ferrari stronger than Mercedes over a long run. Rosberg waves to the crowd after qualifying on the front row, but the German was clearly frustrated to have missed out on pole position. Hamilton's impressive lap on his first run on Q3 was enough to claim his third successive pole at the Chinese Grand Prix. Vettel starts ahead of Williams pair Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas, with Ferrari team-mate Kimi Raikkonen down in sixth place as he struggled in Q3, with his best lap in Q2. Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was seventh quickest ahead of the Lotus of Romain Grosjean, with Sauber pair Felipe Nasr and Marcus Ericsson performing superbly to claim ninth and 10th. Pastor Maldonado lines up 11th, missing out on a place in the top 10 by seven thousandths of a second, with Daniil Kvyat a surprisingly lowly and disappointing 12th in his Red Bull. Jenson Button out-qualified Fernando Alonso for the second consecutive race, but will only start 17th for McLaren. Fernando Alonso starts 18th in Shanghai and will have the Manor cars of Will Stevens and Roberto Merhi for company at the back of the grid. Toro Rosso rookies Max Verstappen and Carlos Sainz Jr start 13th and 14th, with Sergio Perez 15th in a Force India that is off the pace as the team's financial issues means they will not have their new car on the grid until June. From the initial 18-minute session, Force India's Nico Hulkenberg led the list of departees, finishing three tenths of a second behind team -mate Perez. For the first time this season Manor had both cars taking part in qualifying, with both also comfortably finishing within the 107 per cent rule. Will Stevens, forced to sit out qualifying and the races in Australia and Malaysia due to issues, finally enjoyed a one-lap session. The 23-year-old Briton will start 19th, eight tenths of a second ahead of Roberto Merhi, albeit three seconds behind Alonso, underlining that whilst Manor are fighting, they still have a lot of work to do.

Lewis Hamilton claimed his third straight pole position of the season with a scintillating lap in Shanghai. Nico Rosberg was just 0.042secs slower than his Mercedes team-mate.

Article: (CNN)The FBI has confirmed that one of its most wanted terrorists, the Malaysian bomb maker known as Marwan, was killed in an otherwise disastrous raid in the Philippines in January. Marwan, whose real name is Zulkifli bin Hir, was believed by the FBI to a member of southeast Asian terror group Jemaah Islamiyah's central command. The FBI said in February that a DNA sample -- understood to be from a severed finger -- taken from a man killed in a raid in the southern Philippines showed a link with a known relative of Marwan. But the FBI now says tests have confirmed that the dead man was the wanted Islamic extremist. "After a thorough review of forensic data and information obtained from our Philippine law enforcement partners, the FBI has assessed that terrorism subject, Zulkifli Abdhir... is deceased and has been removed from the FBI's list of Most Wanted Terrorists," David Bowdich, assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles field office, told CNN in a statement. The FBI had been offering a $5 million reward for information leading to Marwan's capture in the wake of his 2007 indictment on terror charges in a California court. It accused him of being a supplier of IEDs to terrorist organizations, and having conducted bomb making training for terror groups, including the Philippines-based Abu Sayyaf. Marwan had previously been falsely reported dead after a raid by Philippine security forces in 2012. The Philippines has been fighting an insurgency in the predominantly Muslim south for years, and last year signed a peace agreement with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), the largest rebel group in the region. But in January it launched a surprise raid in pursuit of Marwan at Mamapasono, in the southern province of Maguindanao. The mission went disastrously awry. Forty-four members of the police's elite Special Action Force (SAF) unit were killed in the assault, targeting an area controlled by the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) -- a hardline splinter group which has rejected the peace deal with the Philippines government. According to a report released by the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict (IPAC) last month, the BIFF faction sheltering Marwan had sworn allegiance to ISIS. In the immediate aftermath of the assault, the SAF company charged with executing Marwan came under fire, before another SAF company stationed in nearby MILF territory as a "blocking force" became engaged in an eight-hour firefight with MILF fighters. According to the IPAC report, the SAF "blocking" company eventually ran out of ammunition and only one of their number survived,. Eighteen MILF fighters were killed and a number of BIFF fighters may also died. The clash shattered a three-year ceasefire with the MILF, authorities said. A national day of mourning was declared as the men were laid to rest. Bowdich expressed the FBI's "sincere condolences to the brave officers of the Special Action Force who lost their lives while attempting to apprehend this dangerous fugitive." While an SAF superintendent said at a eulogy for the fallen commandos that their sacrifice had been worth it, controversy has dogged the botched mission in the Philippines. The IPAC report argued that the "single-minded focus" of authorities on killing Marwan has threatened the peace agreement with the MILF, which is yet to cross the final hurdle of being passed into law by the Philippines Congress. "The best chance the southern Philippines has ever had for peace may now be in jeopardy," read the report, which argued that the Mamapasano fiasco was the result of a misguided emphasis on killing Marwan. The report argued that, although Marwan had aided terror attacks and provided funds and equipment to MILF and Abu Sayyaf, he was not "the master bomber that his reputation suggested." Yet for the Philippines authorities and their U.S. allies, killing Marwan had become such a priority that security forces bypassed the mechanisms that had been established to alert the MILF to such operations, for fear of word leaking to their target. The report quoted an anonymous Indonesian associate of Marwan's who described the Malaysian as "a little snake who has been blown up into a dragon."

The match was being held as part of a lavish series of events celebrating the 103rd birthday of Kim Il-Sung, the young leader's grandfather, which falls on Wednesday. North Korea designates the 'Day of the Sun' as a rare two-day national holiday, with art performances, exhibitions and sporting events, and pilgrimages to the late leader's birthplace in Pyongyang. A former member of the North's Unhasu Orchestra, Ri was last seen in public in December 2014, when she and her husband attended a ceremony to commemorate the third anniversary of the death of Kim Jong-un's father, Kim Jong-Il. Their marriage was only revealed in July 2012 when pictures emerged of a young woman accompanying Kim at official events in a break from the past, when the North's first ladies were kept out of the limelight. She was pictured wearing stylish, expensive-looking outfits and on one occasion sported what appeared to be a Christian Dior handbag, in a country plagued by chronic poverty. Their marriage was only revealed in July 2012 when pictures emerged of a young woman accompanying Kim at official events. But Ri has been out of the spotlight since December for unknown reasons. The Kim dynasty has ruled the isolated state for nearly seven decades with an iron fist and pervasive personality cult. Kim Il-Sung led North Korea from its establishment in 1948 until his death on July 8, 1994. He was succeeded by his son, Kim Jong-Il, who also ruled until his death in December 2011 when power was transferred to his son and current leader Kim Jong-un. KCNA said 'an endless stream of people' was visiting, Mangyongdae, the birthplace of Kim Il-Sung, as the 'Day of the Sun' draws near. The images of the couple at a podium flanked by top party officials were published in state media. On Sunday more than 800 runners took place in an international marathon watched by hundreds of fans, including some 600 from abroad, as part of the celebrations. 'Attending the race were more than 600 marathon fans from dozens of countries including Malaysia, Singapore, Sweden, Finland, UK and Italy,' KCNA said. The North announced in February that the April 12 marathon would only be open to domestic runners this year, because of lingering concerns over the Ebola epidemic in west Africa. But it last month reversed a ban on foreigners taking part in the annual run, after lifting strict travel restrictions aimed at keeping out the Ebola virus. Ri Sol-ju here is seen wearing a wedding ring and her husband Kim Jong-un an expensive watch.  Last week he appeared to be wearing a bandage on the same wrist after sustaining an injury. It has now been removed.

Article: Brendan Rodgers has insisted that Raheem Sterling will not be sold this summer, even if he fails to agree a new long-term contract at Anfield. But as we've seen in the past - with Luis Suarez's move to Barcelona a prime example - that sort of promise isn't always kept. Here, Sportsmail takes a look at five possible destinations for the England man. Raheem Sterling, pictured in training on Thursday, has attracted interest from a number of big clubs. ARSENAL. The Gunners have a genuine interest in the Liverpool wonderkid and believe they have the financial capabilities to pull off a mega-deal. But when push comes to shove, can they emerge victorious in what could turn out to be an auction? Sterling has rejected a contract worth £100,000-a-week and could look to force a move away from Liverpool. CHELSEA. The big question is how would Sterling fit into Jose Mourinho's plans given his wealth of attacking talent. But when the best players become available, the best clubs are always in the market. It is no different with the Blues. London will also be a major pull for Sterling. MANCHESTER CITY. City are always in the market for the best British talent as they try to keep up with homegrown quota regulations. Sterling will, perhaps, be the best available British player in the market this summer. Expect City to make their move early in the transfer window. Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has insisted that the club will not sell Sterling this summer. MANCHESTER UNITED. Would Sterling do it? Would Liverpool sell to United? It would certainly a bold move should he join Liverpool's fiercest rivals. They certainly have the finances to make a deal happen. United are looking for superstars this summer. This would be a super transfer. BAYERN MUNICH. Pep Guardiola is understood to be a big fan of the 20-year-old. But would Sterling be up for playing abroad at such an early stage of his career? If he is, then expect Bayern to be in the running for his signature this summer. Bayern Munich boss Pep Guardiola is believed to be keen on Sterling and could make a move for him.

Raheem Sterling could leave Liverpool in the summer transfer window. Arsenal and Manchester City are both interested in signing him. Chelsea could make a big money move if Sterling becomes available. Bayern Munich boss Pep Guardiola is believed to be an admirer.

Article: (CNN)The presence of a harmful pesticide at a luxury villa in the U.S. Virgin Islands may have resulted in the illness of a Delaware family, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Friday. Paramedics were called last week to a rented villa at the Sirenusa resort in St. John after the family of four fell ill. They had rented the villa from March 14 to March 22, and were later hospitalized. The illness was reported to the EPA on March 20. "Our preliminary results do show that there was a presence of methyl bromide in the unit where the family was staying," said Elias Rodriguez, an EPA spokesman. Exposure to methyl bromide can result in serious health effects, including central nervous system and respiratory system damage, according to the EPA. The use of the pesticide is restricted in the United States because of its acute toxicity. It's not allowed to be used indoors. Only certified professionals are permitted to use it in certain agricultural settings. "It's an ongoing investigation; we're still on the island doing our assessment," Rodriguez said. "We have been doing different types of air sampling and wipe sampling." Final test results were expected next week. The EPA is working with local government agencies to investigate whether the family was made ill after a fumigation at the resort on March 18 and whether any environmental regulations or laws were violated. "Pesticides can be very toxic, and it is critically important that they be applied properly and used only as approved by EPA," said Judith A. Enck, a regional administrator for the EPA. "The EPA is actively working to determine how this happened and will make sure steps are taken to prevent this from happening to others at these vacation apartments or elsewhere." Depending on the season, the luxury villa where the family stayed rents between $550 and $1,200 per night. Sea Glass Vacations, which acts as a rental agent for several units at Sirenusa, said that the unit directly below the one where the family stayed was recently treated for pests, but that their unit was not treated. The company said it licensed an outside company, Terminix, for the pest control services. "Sea Glass Vacations does not treat the units it manages for pests but instead relies on licensed professionals for pest control services," the company said in a statement. The U.S. Department of Justice has initiated a criminal investigation into the matter, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing made Monday by ServiceMaster Global Holdings, the parent company of Terminix. In an email to CNN, a spokesman for Terminix wrote that the company is "committed to performing all work... in a manner that is safe for our customers, employees, the public and the environment" and is "looking into this matter internally, and cooperating with authorities." "We're thinking about the family, and we join the community in wishing them a speedy recovery," Terminix wrote. James Maron, an attorney who has been a spokesman for the family, has not responded to requests for comment. The SEC filing described the injuries to the family members as "serious."

Article: Chelsea's Eden Hazard and Arsenal's Santi Cazorla are set to reach a Premier League milestone this weekend when they each make their 100th appearance. Both players have been hugely influential since they moved to London in the summer of 2012, but who has been the most exciting import to watch? Here, Sportsmail's reporters choose the player they most enjoy seeing in action. Eden Hazard (L) and Santi Cazorla are both set to make their 100th Premier League appearance this weekend. Lee Clayton. Cazorla has wonderful balance. So does Hazard. Cazorla scores important goals. So does Hazard. Cazorla is two-footed. So is Hazard. Cazorla dances past opponents. So does Hazard. So, while there is not a lot to choose between them and Hazard is likely to get the most picks in this article, I am going for Cazorla. It's a personal choice. He is a wonderful footballer. I have paid to watch them both (and I will pay to watch them both again), but the little Spanish magician edges it for me. VERDICT: CAZORLA. Cazorla, pictured in action against Burnley, has been an influential part of Arsenal's midfield this season. Ian Ladyman. I remember when Manchester City baulked at paying Hazard's wages when the Belgian was up for grabs in 2012. Back then City thought the young forward had a rather high opinion of his own worth for a player who was yet to play in a major European league. In the early days of his time at Chelsea, it looked as though City may have been right. He showed flashes of brilliance but also looked rather too easy to push off the ball. Roll forward to 2015, however, and the 24-year-old has developed in to one of the most important players in the Barclays Premier League. Brave, strong and ambitious, Hazard plays on the front foot and with only one thought in this mind. Rather like Cristiano Ronaldo, he has also developed in to the type of player ever defender hates, simply because he gets back up every time he is knocked to the ground. He would get in every team in the Premier League and is one of the reasons Chelsea will win the title this season. VERDICT: HAZARD. Hazard controls the ball under pressure from Stoke midfielder Stephen Ireland at Stamford Bridge. Dominic King. It has to be Hazard. I saw him play for Lille twice in the season before he joined Chelsea – once against St Etienne, the other was what proved to be his final appearance against Nancy. He scored two in the first match, a hat-trick the latter and played a different game to those around him. He hasn't disappointed since arriving here and I love the nonchalance with which he takes a penalty, his low centre of gravity and the way he can bamboozle defenders. If there is such a thing as £32million bargain, it is Hazard. VERDICT: HAZARD. Hazard celebrates after scoring a fine individual goal in Chelsea's 3-2 win against Hull in March. Nick Harris. Now this is a tricky one because while Eden Hazard will frequently embark on a dribble or dink in a pass that will make you nod in appreciation, he'll also miss a penalty and make you groan. Whereas the older Cazorla, less flashy but no less of a technical master, is to my mind more of a fulcrum, more important relatively to the sum of Arsenal's parts than Hazard is to Chelsea. You'll gasp at Hazard but Cazorla's wow factor is richer. That's not to dismiss either: both are brilliant footballers, contributing goals, assists and flair. Any neutral would bite your hand off to have either playing in your team. Forced to pick though, it's Cazorla, for his consistency and crucially doing it in the biggest games. Exhibit A would be Manchester City 0 Arsenal 2 in January; goal, assist, all-round brilliance, against a big team, at an important time. VERDICT: CAZORLA. Cazorla scores from the penalty spot in Arsena's 2-0 away win at Manchester City in January. Riath Al-Samarrai. Eden Hazard for me. Cazorla is an utter delight, a little pinball of a man who is probably the most two-footed player I've seen. Put him in a tight space and then you see what makes him rare among the best. But Hazard is the top player in the Premier League, in my opinion. This is the sixth of his eight seasons as a professional where he has reached double figures and yet he offers so much more than goals (36 in 99 in the Premier League for Chelsea). He can beat a man and, better still, you sense he likes doing it. Technically, his passing and shooting are excellent and he also has a mind capable of sussing out the shapes and systems in front of him. That intelligence, more specifically his speed of thought, is probably what makes separates the good from the brilliant. A complete player who doesn't yet seem to have the complete ego. VERDICT: HAZARD. Hazard gets away from Manchester City duo Fernando (left) and Martin Demichelis at Stamford Bridge. Laurie Whitwell. Has to be Hazard for me. The way he carries the ball through ever tightening spaces and emerges the other side is a joy. Like one of those Indiana Jones impossible escapes from a sliding door or rolling boulder. And his penalties are mesmeric. I could watch them again and again not working out how he does it. VERDICT: HAZARD. Belgium international Hazard scores a header past West Ham goalkeeper Adrian at Upton Park. Sami Mokbel. Both are marvellous players, but I could watch Santi Cazorla all day. When he first arrived in England I remember, whilst sitting in the Upton Park press box, trying to work out whether he was left or right footed. He was wonderful that day as Arsenal cruised to a 3-1 win; it was one of the most complete performances I've seen live. In truth, I've still got no idea whether he's left or right footed. He's that natural on either. Hazard is a phenomenon, but aesthetically no on can touch Cazorla in the Premier League. VERDICT: CAZORLA. Cazorla grins after scoring Arsenal's fourth goal against Aston Villa at the Emirates in February. Jack Gaughan. From a purely artistic sense, Santi Cazorla is probably the most graceful individual on the ball in the entire Premier League. But Eden Hazard provides moments to really stick in the memory. He glides past opponents effortlessly and regularly chips in with important goals - plenty of them stunning in their execution. Worth the ticket alone. The one blot from Cazorla's point of view is that his genius can be fleeting. VERDICT: HAZARD. Sam Cunningham. Jose Mourinho has told him to add more goals to his game to move on a par with Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo and, three years younger than the Argentine and six than the Portuguese, he is not far from doing that. I've watched Hazard countless times at Stamford Bridge this season and he makes the game seem like an art form with his movement, dribbling and passing. Cazorla can excite at times, but he is nowhere near consistently reaching Hazard's level. For me there is no contest between the pair. VERDICT: HAZARD. Hazard tucks home yet another penalty during Chelsea 2-1 win against Stoke City last weekend. Craig Hope. I would far rather have Hazard in my team, but I can't help but feel the excitement has been stripped from him under Jose Mourinho. Efficient, technically brilliant, effective and hard-working he most certainly is - and he will be crowned PFA Player of the Year - but he is no longer the daring dribbler of whom we heard so much about during his teenage years in France. He is, though, arguably a better player for Mourinho's influence. Cazorla, meanwhile, would never thrive under Mourinho, there is too much of Juan Mata about him. But there is no doubt he is thrilling to watch on his day - it's just a shame those days aren't as frequent as they should be for a player of his calibre. VERDICT: HAZARD. RESULT: HAZARD 7-3 CAZORLA. Hazard has been voted as a more exciting player than Cazorla in Sportsmail's survey.

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence.
Chelsea star Eden Hazard is set to make his 100th top-flight appearance. Santi Cazorla should hit the same milestone when Arsenal meet Burnley. Both players have impressed since moving to the Premier League in 2012. Hazard has more goals this season but Cazorla has one more assist. Sportsmail's reporters choose the player who has excited them the most.

Article: Darren Bent pounced in stoppage time to rescue a 1-1 draw for Derby against Brentford at the iPro Stadium. The Bees controlled the game for long periods after going ahead through Alex Pritchard's brilliant strike - but missed chances in the second half came back to haunt them when Bent grabbed his 10th goal for the Rams. Derby went into the game knowing they needed to win to keep their slim hopes of automatic promotion alive and Tom Ince twice went close in the opening seven minutes. Alex Pritchard celebrates his stunning strike with his Brentford team-mates, after putting his side ahead. Derby: Grant, Keogh, Albentosa, Forsyth, Warnock (Whitbread 78 mins), Russell (Dawkins 46), Bryson (Lingard 78), Hendrick, Ince, Bent, Martin. Subs not used: Ward, Roos, Hanson, Thomas. Booked: Bryson. Goal: Bent 92. Brentford: Button, Odubajo, Dean, Tarkowski, Bidwell, Douglas, Diagouraga, Jota (Dallas 70), Pritchard (Toral 86), Judge, Gray (Smith 80) Subs not used: Craig, McCormack, Bonham, O'Connell. Goal: Pritchard 21. Booked: Tarkowski. Referee: Graham Scott. The on-loan Hull winger was caught by Toumani Diagouraga in the fifth minute and curled the 25-yard free-kick over the wall and just past David Button's left post with the goalkeeper desperately scrambling to get across. Button had to plunge to his right two minutes later when Ince curled a shot from the edge of the box but Brentford hit back in the 14th minute when Jota's header set up Moses Odubajo for a shot that Lee Grant pushed away. Grant was relieved to see a free-kick from Alan Judge whistle past his left post after Pritchard was tripped by Raul Albentosa just outside the area in the 22nd minute - but he was beaten by a quality goal six minutes later. Diagouraga tackled Jeff Hendrick deep in his own half and found Jonathan Douglas who quickly released Judge, before Pritchard went past Richard Keogh and Craig Bryson and bent a right foot shot from the edge of the box past the despairing dive of Grant. Pritchard again found space just outside the area but this time he shot straight at Grant before Ince ran down the left of Brentford's defence to drive in a low shot which Button saved diving to his left. Alan Judge strikes a free kick over the Derby wall, but it flies just over the crossbar. Brentford were good value for their half-time lead and they came close to increasing it in the 51st minute when Bryson's attempted clearance spun back to Andre Gray - but Albentosa deflected his shot wide. Gray had another chance four minutes later when Douglas played him in but fired wide from eight yards, then the home fans found their voice when sub Simon Dawkins played Bent in but Button raced off his line to make the save. There was a big let-off for Derby in the 68th minute when Jota pulled the ball back from the edge of the six-yard box to tee up Douglas - but his shot was cleared off the line by Craig Forsyth. Brentford had another chance in the 73rd minute when Stuart Dallas crossed to the back post, where Gray headed over at full stretch and the Rams nearly made them pay when Zak Whitbread flicked on a corner and Button made an instinctive save to push the ball behind. But Derby grabbed a goal they barely deserved in the second minute of stoppage time when Hendrick fired in a low shot and Bent pounced to stab home an equaliser that was tough on Brentford. Jonathan Douglas, who had a second-half shot cleared off the line, challenges Jeff Hendrick. Thomas Ince takes on Harlee Dean as Derby struggled to get level in the promotion clash. Darren Bent, who scored the last-minute equaliser for Derby, challenges for a header with Dean.

Alex Pritchard puts Brentford ahead with stunning curling shot. Brentford dominate but fail to take chances to add second goal. Darren Bent pokes home from close range in 92nd minute.

Article: (CNN)Comedian Chris Rock made light of racial disparities in police treatment of whites and blacks with a tongue-in-cheek guide to not being beaten by the police. He encapsulated the frustration and grief caused by a New York grand jury's decision not to indict a white police officer in the death of a black man with a simple tweet: "This one was on film." Now, he's stirring things up again with a series of tweets documenting three traffic stops in seven weeks. "Stopped by the cops again wish me luck," he posted early Tuesday, along with a photo showing him behind the wheel of a car with what looks like blue police lights in the background. He posted similar photos in February. Many African-Americans have long bemoaned the phenomenon of being pulled over for no apparent reason, calling it "driving while black." Blacks are about 30% more likely to be pulled over by police than whites, according to figures reported by the Bureau of Justice Statistics in 2013. And in amid increased conversation over race and policing after the high-profile deaths last year of Eric Garner in New York and Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, the issue is even more sensitive. Rock hasn't commented on the tweets and didn't say how the police stop turned out. He got lots of support on Twitter. "My heart legit dropped, no kidding," one Twitter fan posted. Many praised him for documenting the stops. Some accused him of race-baiting. But one bit of advice in particular lit up social media. Actor Isaiah Washington urged Rock to "#Adapt" to avoid racial profiling. "I sold my $90,000.00 Mercedes G500 and bought 3 Prius's, because I got tired of being pulled over by Police," Washington tweeted. Some saw that as a sell-out, saying Rock shouldn't have to take steps others might not have to as a way to avoid being pulled over. "Let me guess..you also make sure your pants are pulled up as well?." Twitter user YeshaCallahan posted. Appearing on CNN, Washington defended the tweet, saying he wanted to "excite a conversation." Years ago, Rock filmed a sketch for his "Chris Rock" show on HBO in which he detailed ways to avoid being beaten by police as a black man. Besides obeying the law, he suggested bringing a white friend along for the ride. He did just that last year in a segment of "Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee" with Jerry Seinfeld. The two chat as Seinfeld drives an orange Lamborghini. And what happened? They get pulled over after Seinfeld goes a bit heavy on the gas. "Here's the crazy thing," Rock tells Seinfeld as the police officer stops the duo. "If you weren't here, I'd be scared."

Article: Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has said he hopes Burnley escape relegation after seeing his side have to fight to gain a narrow 1-0 victory at Turf Moor. Wenger has been praised by Burnley boss Sean Dyche this season and last night the Gunners boss repaid the compliment by saying: 'It would be a shame for Burnley to go down.' Arsenal were made to fight hard for their eighth win in a row and Wenger said: 'I understand now why they took points from other teams like Chelsea and Manchester City. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has said he hopes Burnley escape relegation from the Premier League. Burnley manager Sean Dyche shakes hands with Wenger following Arsenal 1-0 victory at Turf Moor. 'When you see their performance tonight (Saturday), I am surprised by their plight near the bottom. They have a great solidarity and organisation in their side. Burnley have won only once in 11 games, a famous 1-0 victory against City, but Dyche still believes they can escape the drop. They are currently two points from safety but face three fellow strugglers Hull City, Leicester City and Aston Villa in their final six fixtures. They have played seven teams at the top of the table in their last eight games. Aaron Ramsey (right) scored the only goal of the game, but it was enough to secure three points. The Welsh midfielder points to the sky as he celebrates putting Arsenal into a early 1-0 lead. 'We have six big games coming and we have shown this season we can score goals,' he said. 'We are not naïve. We are willing and have an appetite to succeed.' 'The outside world thought we might not take anything from our last seven games. There are teams around us who are having an awkward time and maybe they feel the next matches more than us. 'It could well go do the wire. I am only concerned about us. I know if our performances are right, we will win games. I think we have measured ourselves well against the top sides and now there are going to be different type of games, edgy games.' Burnley were unlucky not to draw level after this acrobatic attempt was saved by David Ospina.

Article: The omens are looking good. After taking the big race on the opening day of the Grand National festival, AP McCoy repeated the trick on Don Cossack to the delight of a huge Ladies’ day crowd. McCoy, who will ride hot favourite Shutthefrontdoor in the Crabbie’s Grand National on Saturday, struck on day one in the Doom Bar Aintree Hurdle with Jezki. If the trend continues, McCoy will be celebrating another victory in the biggest race of all. And if he wanted a further sign that the cards are falling in his favour, the last time he won the Melling Chase – on Alberta’s Run in 2010 – he followed up the next day in the Grand National on Don’t Push It. AP McCoy celebrates after winning the Melling Chase race at Aintree on Friday. McCoy rode Don Cossack to victory as he prepares for his final Grand National on Saturday. There may have been some fortune attached to Jezki’s victory as favourite Arctic Fire fell at the last flight when poised to challenge. Here, though, there was no luck involved. Don Cossack was mighty impressive in running away with The Grade One Betfred Melling Chase, prompting his trainer Gordon Elliot to talk of a challenge for the Cheltenham Gold Cup next year. This was one of the more straightforward successes in McCoy’s career, as once he took up the running three fences from home the result was never in doubt. Don Cossack ridden by McCoy (second left) leads the field on the way to victory at Aintree. McCoy jumps the final fence on Don Cossack as he rides to victory in the Melling Steeple Chase. In the end, there was a yawning 26-lengths back to second placed Cue Card, with John’s Spirit back in third. Elliott, who won the Grand National in 2007 with Silver Birch, said: ‘The horse is the apple of my eye. I was delighted to see him sent on when he was, as we know that he stays. It is nice having a winner for AP, as well. He is a genius. He has ridden a good few winners for me over the years.’ This has been a memorable meeting for Elliott, who saddled a first day double with Clarcam and Tagliatelle. He saddles Cause of Causes in the big one and hopes are high of a bold show. ‘When I won the National last time, I didn’t really appreciate it, ’said Elliott. ‘We are looking forward to tomorrow (Saturday).’

Article: Arsene Wenger has challenged his squad to put any dreams of a late charge for the Barclays Premier League to bed and focus instead on the cold reality of winning at Burnley on Saturday. Arsenal head to Turf Moor in search of what would be an eighth straight league victory, following on from last weekend's 4-1 triumph over Liverpool. Despite their superb run, which has seen confidence grow after some 15 wins in the last 17 through all competitions, the title remains Chelsea's to lose, as the leaders currently hold a seven-point advantage and also a match in hand. Nacho Monreal, Theo Walcott, Hector Bellerin and Olivier Giroud appear in good spirits during training. Mesut Ozil shares a joke with Monreal at Arsenal's training HQ while Alexis Sanchez has his shorts rolled up. Santi Cazorla is set to make his 100th Premier League appearance while Abou Diaby is back from injury. While some Gunners fans may have allowed themselves a little bit of fantasy football results over the run-in, which will see Chelsea come to the Emirates Stadium on April 26 and also play both Manchester United and Liverpool, Wenger remains very much focused on the job in hand. 'I have enough experience to know that I have to live with reality and reality is points and the next game,' he said. 'The dreams are for everybody - we all have dreams at night, but when I wake up in the morning I have to come here and make sure we give everything to win the next game.' Wenger continued: 'Chelsea have a difficult schedule, we have a difficult schedule, but what we can only do is master our own schedule. 'What we want is to go as high as we can until the end of the season, give our best and we are also in the semi-final of the FA Cup. 'So we are at an important moment of the Premier League season and it is a period where you show your quality by focusing on the next game and maintain the quality. 'Of course we want to continue to progress and improve - we can learn from victory as well and everything was not perfect in our last game.' Mathieu Flamini, Ozil and Sanchez are pictured at Arsenal's London Colney base on Friday. Laurent Koscielny is put through his paces on Friday as he bids to return to full fitness. Jack Wilshere hasn't played since November but is in line to feature at Burnley on Saturday evening. Arsenal's injury problems look to have finally eased, with midfielders Mikel Arteta, Jack Wilshere and Abou Diaby all having stepped up their rehabilitation from injury, along with full-back Mathieu Debuchy. England international Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, though, continues to be hampered by an inflamed groin, while centre-half Laurent Koscielny will face a fitness test on his thigh problem ahead of Saturday's match. Burnley continue to scrap at the other end of the table, currently second bottom, but only two points from safety. With Manchester City having gone down 1-0 at Turf Moor last month and Tottenham then held to a goalless draw, Wenger is not taking the trip to Lancashire lightly. He said: 'You shouldn't look at the table because they started slowly, but recently they have played very well against all the big teams in the league and are quite efficient at home. 'You have to be at their level of physical performance, because they will be there. 'On the rest, you want to produce the quality of performance that is expected from us on the technical side, but you have first to fight with them physically, that's for sure. 'We have to make sure we produce the expected performance on the commitment, on the focus and on the quality of our game.'

Article: Hong Kong (CNN)Six people were hurt after an explosion at a controversial chemical plant in China's southeastern Fujian province sparked a huge fire, provincial authorities told state media. The plant, located in Zhangzhou city, produces paraxylene (PX), a reportedly carcinogenic chemical used in the production of polyester films and fabrics. The blast occurred at an oil storage facility Monday night after an oil leak, though local media has not reported any toxic chemical spill. Five out of six people were injured by broken glass and have been sent to the hospital for treatment, Xinhua news agency reported. More than 600 firefighters were sent to battle the blaze and the fire is now under control, the Zhangzhou fire department wrote on their official microblogging account Tuesday morning. Residents living close to the plant had heard the explosion and took to Weibo to post photos of the fire. One user wrote that he heard a loud blast and felt slight tremors. The plant was hit by another explosion in July 2013, although there were no reports of casualties or toxic leaks at the time. Though demonstrations are illegal in China, the construction of PX plants has sparked protests, which have occasionally turned violent, in several cities in recent years. The Zhangzhou plant was slated for Xiamen -- a densely populated city in the southeast of the country. However, it provoked an angry backlash in 2007 due to pollution concerns and prompted the local government to relocate the factory to its current, more remote location.

Article: Arsenal are the form team in Europe at present, winning 10 games out of their last 11, including seven in a row. Their recent success can probably be explained by a number of reasons. Players have returned from injury at the right time, Olivier Giroud can't stop scoring, Hector Bellerin and Francis Coquelin have emerged, while Arsene Wenger seems to have found his drive once again. But could there be something else? With the Gunners preparing for the Premier League trip to Burnley on Saturday, one of their partners Europcar have revealed how some of the first-team stars motivate themselves on the team bus with some interesting and uncharacteristic selections included. Arsenal players have revealed their ultimate pre-game playlist ahead of their Premier League tie with Burnley. Olivier Giroud selected Coldplay's 'Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall' as his selected track. For instance, who would have guessed Giroud was a Coldplay fan? And can you picture Laurent Koscielny nodding along to Pharrell Williams' hit 'Happy' before defending at Turf Moor? And that's not all. Nacho Monreal opts for Dance DJ legend David Guetta's lead single from his sixth album 'Dangerous', David Ospina will even find time for some Colombian rap with J Balvin's track 'Tranquila' pre-game. Santi Cazorla has been in sparkling form in recent months with his languid style of creating from deep. So it is perhaps no surprise that the Spanish playmaker opts for something a bit softer - with pop singer from his homeland Melendi giving the 30-year-old all he needs before setting foot off the bus. Cazorla's track choice may be slightly more old school, but that's nothing compared to Theo Walcott. The England forward is obviously Loungin' before games with his selection of LL Cool J's 1996 summer hip-hop tune, which doesn't quite posses the fast pace we expect from Walcott on the pitch. Santi Cazorla's style of music seems to suit him - selecting Spanish pop star Melendi's slow track. Nacho Monreal appears to be a fan of up-beat dance music, opting for David Guetta track 'Dangerous' Laurent Koscielny may prepare for defending at Turf Moor by listening to 'Happy' by Pharrell Williams. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Calum Chambers, Danny Welbeck, Aaron Ramsey and Kieran Gibbs are the youngest players on the list, so it is perhaps no surprise they go for recent and more mainstream hits. Phillip George's house track 'Wish You Were Mine', Macklemore's smash record 'Can't Hold Us', 'End Credits by drum and bass duo Chase and Status (ft Plan B), the Arctic Monkeys' indie toe-tapper 'Arabella' and Royal Blood's 'Figure It Out' are there respective selections. The light-hearted activity is designed to bring fans closer to their heroes, giving an insight into day in the life of a Premier League footballer before an important game. 'As Arsenal's official car and van rental partner, we wanted to bring travelling fans closer to their heroes so they can be inspired by the player's ultimate playlist which will get them fired up for another important game this weekend,' explained Ken McCall, Managing Director, Europcar UK Group. 'It's certainly an eclectic playlist. 'We wish Arsenal the very best of luck in the match.' Burnley are desperate for three points at the bottom of the table, while the Gunners are looking to keep their faint title chances alive with a win in the Saturday evening fixture. Colombian goalkeeper David Ospina selected a rap song from his home country - J Balvin's 'Tranquila' Theo Walcott opted for a 1996 summer jam - LL Cool J's laid back R&B song 'Loungin''

Article: England's premier bowler Jimmy Anderson suffered a frustrating day in his bid to become his country's all-time leading wicket taker in his 100th Test appearance in Antigua. But pace attack colleague Chris Jordan believes the Anderson family celebration party is 'just around the corner' as West Indies fell to 155 for four in response to England's first-innings total of 399. Anderson, watched by his parents, wife, two daughters and agent and needing four wickets to overtake the great Sir Ian Botham's haul of 383, claimed only one early victim in West Indies opener Devon Smith in his 13 overs, which went for 24 runs and eight maidens. Jimmy Anderson moved to within two wickets of Sir Ian Botham's record of 383 Test wickets. Anderson could only take the one wicket on day two of the first Test in Antigua. But even the England back-room staff were surprised that Anderson bowled just four overs in the last session of play with team-mates Jordan, Stuart Broad and James Tredwell sharing the other wickets to fall. It could have been better but a Ben Stokes wicket was ruled a no ball. Jordan took a stunning slip catch off Tredwell to dismiss West Indies vice-captain Kraigg Brathwaite, who claimed after play that he thought Anderson'looked tired'. But Jordan said: 'Jimmy got us off and running with the first wicket and the rest of us tried to back that up, which I thought we did pretty well. If he keeps doing that and bowling the way he does those wickets are just around the corner. Chris Jordan jumps for joy after taking the wicket of Darren Bravo on the second afternoon. Jordan appeals for an lbw against West Indian batsman Kraigg Brathwaite, but it was unsuccessful. 'The stat is obviously there but I don't think Jimmy or any of us are going about our cricket or thinking about things differently. 'We're just trying to group balls as a bowling unit and create pressure. 'As a group we try and win every session, so we'll come back as hard as we can to break this partnership then make inroads into the tail.' Ironically, No 11 Anderson and Jordan were the pick of the lower-order England batsman in a last-wicket partnership of 38 as the West Indies bowling attack, inspired by a talk from bowling coach Sir Curtly Ambrose, captured the last five wickets for 58. West Indies opener Brathwaite did a good job of seeing off Anderson in a challenging first spell and though he eventually fell for 39, he enjoyed the test. Jordan later took a stunning catch at first slip off Tredwell's bowling to dismiss Brathwaite. 'Obviously when Anderson started with the new ball it was moving a lot, so facing him then was a little more challenging. 'But obviously he bowled a couple of overs before lunch as well so I don't know if maybe he was a little bit tired. 'It was a good challenge facing him when the ball is swinging both ways. The key is to keep as still as possible.' Brathwaite's knock would probably have lasted longer had anyone other than the athletic Jordan been stationed at slip, where he claimed a superb one-handed catch inches off the ground. Jordan is, of course, Barbados born - a fact not lost on Brathwaite. 'It was CJ who caught me, a fella from here, so it was quite unlucky.' About his catch, Jordan said:'It was a reaction one but it rivals my best at this level.'

Jimmy Anderson claimed his 381st Test wicket on Tuesday in Antigua. The 32-year-old dismissed Devon Smith for 10 on day two of first Test. Anderson is still two wickets behind Sir Ian Botham's record of 383. Chris Jordan says that the record is 'just around the corner'

Article: (CNN)The United States Department of Justice has named a new defendant in the war on drugs, and the charges are serious indeed. A 15-count indictment filed in federal court in California bristles with accusations of conspiracies, transporting prescription pharmaceuticals dispensed with illegal prescriptions, violations of the Controlled Substances Act, misbranding charges, and money laundering charges. Who is this menace to society? FedEx. Yes, the courier delivery service. Wait, can companies even be charged with crimes?  Where would a FedEx be incarcerated?  Is there a corporate Shawshank Prison?  How does one fit a company for a prison jumpsuit? It turns out a corporation can indeed be prosecuted like a person. It's a practice the Supreme Court has approved of for over a century. In fact, in many ways they are easier to prosecute than people.  Corporations don't have all the same inconvenient constitutional rights as citizens accused of crimes. Imprisoning convicted citizens is expensive, but corporate convictions, on the other hand, turn tidy profits for the U.S. government, with zero prison overhead. Even if corporations can be held criminally liable, should a courier service like FedEx be held liable for "possessing" what bad guys may send through the service? The answer, according to FedEx, is not just "No," but a "No" so conclusive that this case should never see a courtroom. The company maintains that it is innocent. It has a point. "Possession" is an elusive concept.  When it comes to drugs, the law recognizes two kinds of possession: actual and constructive. Actual possession is when you have physical control over the contraband. When you have a gun in your hand or drugs in your pocket, you "actually" possess those things. The somewhat hazier concept of "constructive possession" means you can "possess" something without even having it on your person, as long as you have ownership, dominion or control over the contraband or the property where it is found. For example, the government would argue that while you may not have actual possession of the 5,000 OxyContin pills in the trunk of your car parked in your driveway, you "constructively" possessed them. Conversely, sometimes you can be holding something in your hand or have it in your vehicle, but not "possess" it either actually or constructively, in the eyes of the law. Such is the case with couriers who routinely drive to your home, walk up to your door and hand you a package, completely ignorant about what is inside it. It's hard to argue the UPS guy intentionally "possessed" your subscription to porno mags, in their nondescript brown packaging. That is the idea behind the "common carrier" exception to possession, and a large part of FedEx's compelling legal argument. A "common carrier" is one who offers its services to members of the public -- without much discretion -- and is engaged in the business of transporting persons or property for compensation. The public policy reasons behind "common carrier" exemptions make sense; the industry simply couldn't function if every driver, courier and handler who touches a valid shipment of OxyContin had to obtain a prescription for opiates to be legally allowed to deliver it to your front door. That would lead to an absurd result. That's why the Controlled Substances Act and the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act allow common carriers to lawfully possess controlled substances, so long as it is in the usual course of their business. Of course, this is not a permission slip for drug runners to avoid liability by calling themselves "common carriers." That's why the "usual course of business" language acts as an additional safety measure. In court papers, FedEx's lawyers offer the example of an airline whose sole activity was flying controlled substances from Jamaica to Miami. This would not be acting in the usual course of business of a common carrier, since this imaginary airline is not offering its services to the public, generally. On the other hand, FedEx argues that it is indeed a common carrier, performing the normal duties of a common carrier, because (a) it is engaged in the business of transportation of property and (b) it offers its services to the public generally. It's hard to imagine extending liability to common carriers for possession of contraband. Does this mean a Greyhound bus driver becomes liable for marijuana possessed by a passenger? The bus driver would argue he has no reason to know if a particular passenger is carrying drugs. But if the guy boards the bus with a Grateful Dead T-shirt and a set of bongos, shouldn't the driver at least have a hunch? That seems dangerously close to profiling. Is this another illogical straw man argument? Maybe. Obviously, the Department of Justice disagrees, which is why it has brought this criminal prosecution. According to the indictment, from at least as early as 2004, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Food and Drug Administration, and members of Congress put FedEx on notice that illegal Internet pharmacies were using its shipping services to distribute controlled substances and prescription drugs in violation of the Controlled Substances Act, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and numerous state laws. The indictment alleges that as early as 2004, FedEx knew that it was delivering drugs to dealers and addicts. FedEx's couriers in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia expressed safety concerns that were circulated to FedEx senior management. The DOJ is making the argument that even though FedEx carries and delivers whatever is handed to it by the public, FedEx knew or should have known in specific instances that it was involving itself in suspicious drug activity. It raises a larger question, though: Why do we prosecute inanimate objects that we can't even incarcerate? The answer is the same reason that the drug dealers deal drugs, and drug smugglers smuggle them: Money. Power. The government in these cases gets to impose its will and policy upon large corporations -- in this case, it would be to force FedEx to help law enforcement in policing shady pharmaceutical transportation. The government also gets to extract gargantuan sums of money from corporations in "deferred prosecution agreements." The reason you don't see a lot of corporate trials is because most companies prefer to enter into such agreements; for a company, a public prosecution alone would be tantamount to a death sentence, whether or not it's found guilty. Still, every defense attorney would love to offer the option to his or her human clients of avoiding felony conviction and a potential life sentence -- by agreeing to pay some fines. Don't get me wrong: I'm all about prosecuting the black market, especially if that means prosecuting the guys who send us those spam emails to our work accounts with "V1AGRA" in the subject line, for our co-workers to see while we go to the bathroom. I want those guys locked up for sure. I'm just not sure that FedEx has anything to do with the kingpins of the "FR33 CYALIS" email campaign. The DOJ's underlying intentions are noble enough -- this is an attack on the supply line of the illegal drug market by attacking the actual supply chain. It makes good strategic sense. It might seem like good financial sense in the short run, with the millions in fines extracted from corporations, but that money has to come from somewhere. It's just a matter of time before that trickles down to job cuts and less leg room on our flights. It probably doesn't make good legal sense either. Yes, we have been treating corporations as fictional "persons" for centuries in some ways -- but it's silly to treat them as persons in all ways. FedEx has a strong argument for dismissal in this case, but even if not, it won't be swapping its logo orange for prison orange anytime soon.

Article: Brazilian teams are on alert because of a dengue fever outbreak that has already affected some of the country's top clubs. Three players were diagnosed with the mosquito-borne disease this week, including Corinthians striker Paolo Guerrero. Players have been forced to use insect repellent during practice sessions and clubs have asked health officials to check their training centres for mosquito breeding sites. Brazilian football clubs have been put on alert after a dengue fever outbreak. In addition to Guerrero, Palmeiras reserve goalkeeper Aranha and young Santos striker Leo Cittadini also have been diagnosed with the disease and won't be able to help their teams in the final stages of the Sao Paulo state championship this month. 'We have to find a way to stay away from this little mosquito,' Palmeiras midfielder Arouca said. Guerrero, Corinthians' top striker, will also miss his team's last two games in the group stage of the Copa Libertadores, Latin America's top club tournament. The Peruvian has been hospitalized since Saturday and there is no word on when he will be released. Corinthians striker Paolo Guerrero is one of three players that have already been diagnosed. The players affected will need about two weeks to fully recover from the disease, which causes extreme joint pain and headaches. There is no cure, but is rarely fatal. Cases of dengue fever have increased significantly across Brazil this year, with most of them reported in Sao Paulo state. Brazil's health ministry said there have been more than 460,000 cases of the disease in the country in 2015, which accounts for almost 5,000 cases a day. More than 130 people have died so far this year, the ministry said. Corinthians midfielder Renato Augusto said some players have been practicing with pants and long sleeves to try to avoid the mosquitoes. 'We are afraid, of course,' he said. 'It turns out it's not only the defenders we have to worry about these days.' Guerrero, who used to play for Bayern Munich, in action for Corinthians in a Copa Libertadores match. Another Corinthians player, defender Rodrigo Sam, was hospitalized for two weeks after getting the disease earlier this year. Health officials inspected Corinthians' training center this week and said there were no signs of breeding sites for mosquitoes carrying dengue. The popular Brazilian club said the players were likely infected while away from the team's premises. Still, doctor Ivan Grava said players would continue to use insect repellent and, when possible, the team would not practice during times mosquitoes were more likely to appear. Another top Brazilian club affected by dengue fever this year was Sao Paulo. One of the team's doctors had the disease, and players recently expressed their concern about having to play a match in a city where the disease had spread quickly.

Article: Given the inexorable march of the past 12 months in one direction, perhaps it is only appropriate that Rory McIlroy should spend the eve of the Masters on Wednesday with a member of the celebrated boy band of that name. But it is not lookalike Harry Styles who will carry the Northern Irishman's bag in the par-three tournament but keen golfer Niall Horan as McIlroy looks for a little light relief before his first attempt to complete a career Grand Slam. One Direction released their debut album in 2011, the same year McIlroy won his first major, so you could say they have mirrored each other, hit for greatest hit. Rory McIlroy watches a tee shot during a practice round prior to the start of the 2015 Masters Tournament. McIlroy alongside his caddie Caroline Wozniacki during the 2014 Par 3 Contest  in Augusta. McIlroy celebrates with his  Wozniacki on the 9th hole during  the Par 3 contest at Augusta National Golf Club. At last year's Masters, McIlroy piqued the interest of one or two photographers when then fiancee Caroline Wozniacki donned the caddie's famous white boiler suit. He might find the curiosity levels are even greater this time, for One Direction are even more popular in the US than in Britain. Between them, Niall, an honorary member at Mullingar, Westmeath, and Rory might do more to stir up interest in golf among the young than any number of 'old fogey' initiatives. 'We met in Australia at the end of last year and he was saying he had never been to The Masters,' said McIlroy. 'I said if you're available on the Wednesday you're more than welcome to carry the bag. Niall's really excited.' Niall Horan will swap girls screams for Augusta greens as he caddies for golfer McIlroy. McIlroy hits a putt in the rain during a practice round prior to the start of the 2015 Masters Tournament. McIlroy looked more subdued than excited at his press conference yesterday, possibly because he knew what was coming. On the one hand, he feels as ready as he ever will for his tilt at history. On the other, he had to spend 30 minutes with journalists wanting to trawl over his poor record at Augusta. Here is a sample: Why is your record so bad on the par fives, Rory? Why have you never birdied either the first or the 10th holes? Why have you left here for the past five years with at least one 77 on your score card? What the hell's wrong given all the advantages offered by your length off the tee? McIlroy  walks over the Nelson Bridge with caddie J.P. Fitzgerald during a practice round. To be fair, he answered them all with politeness. After all, there was nothing there he had not analysed and dissected countless times himself. McIlroy knows better than anyone he has no chance unless he does better on the long holes. He brought up the point raised in the Sportsmail graphic from last Saturday, which compared his record on the par fives last year with that of winner Bubba Watson. 'Just look at the two par fives on the back nine on Sunday,' he said. 'I had a nine iron in my hand for my second shot on both and I walked off with two sixes. Two fours I'd have finished third. McIlroy waits under an umbrella during a practice round prior to the start of the 2015 Masters Tournament. 'It's something I've been thinking about a lot. Look at Bubba, who played them in eight-under for the week to my level par and beat me by eight shots. 'I've just been too aggressive at times. I had four sixes on par-fives last year, so if I can clean up those, I'll have a chance to win.' As for those 77s, he said: 'It's not like I'm having a bad 18 holes. It's always just a bad nine holes that causes the damage and it's usually on a Friday, like last year. But I am better equipped now to handle it if things don't go right way. Mentally, I'm in a far better place.' McIlroy conceded that the circus surrounding Tiger Woods's return had not been unhelpful and the draw has worked out pretty well, too. The place you do not want to be come Thursday is in one of the last two groups, like Woods, but McIlroy has been treated kindly, with a mid-morning threesome alongside Americans Phil Mickelson and Ryan Moore. 'I don't think I've played alongside Phil at Augusta so that's perfect,' he said. 'We always get along well and he has a great record here. It will be fun to watch him.' It was this time last week, while practising in Florida, that McIlroy pronounced himself ready to go. 'It's been great not to have to think of anything technical while I'm playing,' he said. 'I've been able to enjoy the build-up.' Rory McIlroy waits with his caddie Fitzgerald in the rain during a practice round  at Augusta National Golf Club. Asked who he saw as favourite, McIlroy went for Bubba — ironic given a recent ESPN survey among the pros ranked Watson as the least favourite. 'I take it as I need to improve as a man,' said Watson, with the sort of annoying comment that explains his unpopularity in the first place. As for McIlroy, he knows where he needs to improve. 'You look at this course and it should fit me perfectly from tee to green,' he said. After One Direction on Wednesday, it'll be his turn to generate some roars.

Article: He was, as one ECB board member put it, just too accident-prone for a role that has seen him flounder in the face of the bitter fallout from an Ashes whitewash. Paul Downton was brave enough to make huge decisions in his first 14 months as England’s managing director but the jury is still out on all of them at a time as the clamour for change has grown louder. It was Downton who made the big call to sack Kevin Pietersen and reappoint Peter Moores as England coach. Paul Downton has left his role as managing director of England and Wales Cricket Board. The move came a day ahead of an ECB board meeting that was meant to discuss the future of Downton. OCTOBER 2013. Downton, a former England wicketkeeper, is appointed managing sirector of England and Wales Cricket Board, with his position taking effect from February 1, 2014. FEBRUARY 2014. After the Ashes whitewash, Kevin Pietersen and head coach Andy Flower are sacked. After days of silence, the official line on Pietersen’s dismissal is that the ECB wanted to ‘create a culture’ in which captain Alastair Cook had ‘the full support of all players’. MARCH 2014. England suffer a humiliating 45-run defeat to Holland in the World T20. Ravi Bopara top-scored for England with just 18. APRIL 2014. Downton appoints Peter Moores, who had spent the previous four seasons as head coach at Lancashire, for a second spell as England head coach. MAY 2014. Downton and the ECB issue an apology to Pietersen for claiming he appeared ‘disinterested’ and ‘distracted’ during the fifth Ashes Test in Sydney. JUNE 2014. England lose a Test series at home to Sri Lanka. The south Asian side had previously won on English soil in 1998 — in a one-off Test match. JULY-AUG 2014. England lose the second Test against India, but come back to win the home series 3-1. In the fifth Test, England inflict upon India their third heaviest defeat in history. DECEMBER 2014. Cook is sacked as one-day captain and replaced by Eoin Morgan, marking the end of a sorry year for England in which they won just 18 of their 48 matches across all formats. FEBRUARY-MARCH 2015. England endure a dreadful World Cup campaign, failing to advance from the group stage and finishing behind Bangladesh, who sealed their exit with a 15-run victory. APRIL 2015. Downton departs as ECB managing director. The ECB are to create a new role of ‘director of England Cricket’ ahead of the Ashes series. He also had to back the decision to replace Alastair Cook as one-day captain on the brink of the World Cup even though it was the selectors who drove it. But, most of all, it is England’s humiliating World Cup that led the 14 members of the ECB management board to unanimously back the sacking of Downton when new chief executive Tom Harrison rang them on Wednesday morning. So acute was the embarrassment at England going out in the first round of the World Cup that any hopes Downton had for an extended stay in office proved impossible. To the new regime he had to go. ‘Hugh Morris (his predecessor) stayed in the background but Paul became far too high-profile,’ one board member told Sportsmail on Wednesday night. ‘He was always on the outfield before games. The bottom line is that he was just too accident prone.’ Downton is the most high-profile casualty so far of that new broom sweeping through English cricket, led by Harrison and chairman-elect Colin Graves but he will not be the last, unless England are successful in their busiest of all years. James Whitaker, the national selector, is the most vulnerable, not least because a change of job description for Downton’s successor to director of England cricket looks likely to make the new man an all-round supremo. Moores and captain Alastair Cook now need to beat the West Indies in the three-Test series starting in Antigua on Monday if they are to feel secure. They must then carry on winning when they face New Zealand, Australia, Pakistan and South Africa over the next 10 months in Test cricket alone. Whether this makes a difference to Pietersen’s future remains to be seen. Clearly the removal of the man who sacked him and an ECB chairman Giles Clarke who was firmly against Pietersen must increase the odds on one of the most unlikely comebacks in sport history happening this summer. Much may depend on who replaces Downton because there is still no real appetite within the ECB, and certainly not among senior members of the England team, for Pietersen to return. His best chance may be if Michael Vaughan is appointed by a man he is known to be close to in Graves. The former England captain  said on Wednesday that he would like to talk to the ECB about the role. Vaughan was the England captain who brought the best from Pietersen, admittedly when he was young and far less likely to cause trouble, and has made no secret of his encouragement for his return. Yet Vaughan, a constant critic of Downton and Moores, has a myriad of interests, both cricketing and otherwise, that he presumably must shelve if he is to return to the ECB now. A more likely scenario is for another former England captain in Andrew Strauss to take up a role that would appear made for him. There were many at the ECB who wanted Strauss to succeed Morris, not least the Welshman himself, but he ruled it out at the time, saying it was too soon after the end of his playing career. Since then he has dabbled in commentary with Sky but may now think the time is right for what seems a natural progression to administration. Downton's job description has been abolished as a result following England's dismal World Cup showing. Downton leaves his role as ECB managing director following England's shameful performance at World Cup. Former England captain Michael Vaughan  said on Wednesday he would like to talk to the ECB about the role. Kevin Pietersen (left) could return for England while Andrew Strauss (right) is another that could take the role. Pietersen was uncharacteristically coy when asked on Twitter for his thoughts on Downton’s departure. Alec Stewart is another candidate who, presumably, would have a more open mind about recalling Pietersen as he has just re-signed him for Surrey. He is the third man on the most likely three-man short-list. The best brains in English cricket are undoubtedly Hussain and Atherton so Harrison and Graves should be doing all they possibly can to encourage one of them to return to the national cause. Hussain has already refused and it is extremely unlikely Atherton would be tempted either. Downton has become a derided character but he does not deserve to be the figure of ridicule he has become as frustration has grown at the national team. He was a respected wicketkeeper-batsman with England who had to play much of his Test cricket against the West Indies at their peak and was widely admired for his bravery and gutsy character. His return to cricket after a career in the City came at a time when Morris assured him that everything was in place for a bright future. England’s catastrophic collapse in Australia changed everything. The decision to ditch Pietersen was, as far as I am concerned, absolutely right while Moores may yet prove to be the coach Downton and others believe him to be. But a fall-guy was needed for the World Cup and Downton was the obvious candidate. It remains to be seen how many follow.

Downton speaks with Sir Ian Botham  at Lord's Cricket Ground on May 31, 2014. Meanwhile, here in Basseterre, Jonny Bairstow picked a bad day to remind England that he is a player of real potential despite being jettisoned after the winter’s Ashes disaster. England’s decision to turn their second warm-up game into a practice session saw Bairstow, Jonathan Trott, Gary Ballance and Joe Root bat for an extremely weak St Kitts Invitational XI against their own team. Trott fell third ball to Jimmy Anderson, fending a ball outside off stump to third slip, while Ballance still looked out of touch in being dismissed for 17. Yet Bairstow, the back-up keeper on this tour, made the most of his chance to score 98 before falling to the impressive Ben Stokes. There was an early worry when Stuart Broad slipped in his delivery stride and fell clutching his ankle. He went off for treatment but later returned to bowl and looked no worse for the accident. Root was also struck flush on the helmet fielding at short leg but came out later to bat for St Kitts. England will bat for the whole of Thursday before leaving for Monday’s first Test in Antigua. Alastair Cook. Downton was a supporter of Cook as Test captain but was persuaded to sack him as one-day captain three weeks before the disastrous World Cup campaign. The new ‘Director of England cricket’ might think Cook needs to go back to scoring runs at the top of the order after failing to convince as a tactician. Verdict: Vulnerable. Alastair Cook was suppoerted by Downton before being sacked as one-day captain before the World Cup. James Whitaker. The chairman of selectors and former Leicestershire captain has been involved in one of the grimmest periods in English cricket. Selections have been difficult to fathom at times and a series of well-publicised clangers have alienated the selector from players, spectators and media. Verdict: Sure to follow Downton out the door. England selector James Whitaker (left) and former managing director Downton during a nets session. Peter Moores. An atrocious World Cup heaped even more pressure on the coach, whose reappointment last year by Downton has been mitigated only by last summer’s Test series win against India. Described as ‘the outstanding coach of his generation’ by Downton, Moores’ position is now as weak as it has been. Verdict: Vulnerable. Peter Moores’ position is now as weak as it has been following Downton's dismissal at the ECB. Kevin Pietersen. It is almost inconceivable that barely six months after publishing one of the most vitriolic books in the history of sport, this high-maintenance player could be on the brink of a return. But Downton’s removal, and Giles Clarke’s departure, means the path is now clear for Pietersen if he scores runs for Surrey. Verdict: Return possible. Kevin Pietersen's path is now clear to return if he scores runs for Surrey and he tweeted just as much.

Article: Forget Swansea, Stoke City and West Ham, the top seven would be seriously challenged by 'Team Pardew' should this manager have had a full season in charge at one club. That is after Crystal Palace, managed by Alan Pardew, beat Manchester City 2-1 at Selhurst Park on Monday night, the English manager's ninth win  in South London since leaving his role at Newcastle at the end of December. His former club have since plummeted in the Premier League while Palace now find themselves threatening the top half, and combining his records at both clubs this season would see 'Team Pardew' sit in eighth place, just five points behind Southampton. Alan Pardew could be a candidate for manager of the year with his record at Newcastle and Crystal Palace. The Premier League table with Team Pardew in - as well as a team complied from pre/post Pardew results. Newcastle fans were calling for Pardew's head for many years, seen as owner Mike Ashley's puppet, and were sitting in 10th place when the 53-year-old returned 'home' to Crystal Palace. The Eagles were in the relegation zone along with Burnley and Leicester City, struggling to pick up points following Neil Warnock's sacking. But while John Carver has picked up just nine points in his 12 games in charge at St James' Park, Pardew's Palace now have 39 points and are comfortably above the drop zone. A team compiled with Newcastle and Crystal Palace's stats pre/post Pardew would be sitting in 19th (albeit with 22 Premier League clubs now technically involved). A top-half finish is now the aim for Pardew and his men, as Toon supporters still fear relegation following a 1-0 derby defeat to Sunderland on Easter Sunday. Pardew celebrates with his Newcastle team and Moussa SIssoko after his goal against QPR in November. Newcastle fans hold a banner calling the removal of Pardew in a Premier League game at Stoke in September. John Carver's Toon side are not safe from relegation yet after a 1-0 defeat at the hands of Sunderland. It all started with a 4-0 win at Dover Athletic in the FA Cup and now Crystal Palace have won four in five, most recently beating the champions. His stock will continue to rise with this table, which would put him just six points adrift of Liverpool in fifth. Pardew has recently insisted he would perform at a top club, better than Monday's counterpart Manuel Pellegrini at least, while he is definitely a contender for Premier League Manager of the Year award. And nobody would have predicted that in 2014. Glenn Murray celebrates after netting the opening goal during Crystal Palace's victory over Manchester City.

Crystal Palace beat Manchester City 2-1 at Selhurst Park on Monday. South London side are  11th in Premier League table and look to be safe.

Article: Their clubs have experienced contrasting fortunes on the pitch in recent weeks but Danny Welbeck and several of the Liverpool squad appear to share a mutual fondness for Nicki Minaj. The Gunners forward was spotted arriving at the Manchester Arena on Monday night to watch the pop star perform, two days after his side thrashed the Reds 4-1 at the Emirates. Liverpool full back Jose Enrique was also in attendance at the concert along with team-mates Alberto Moreno and Mamadou Sakho.

And while the the Liverpool players might have been enjoying Minaj's 2014 hit 'Anaconda', Brendan Rodgers would almost certainly have still been reeling from a heavy defeat that strangled the life out of the club's hopes of reaching the Champions League. Enrique, who took to Instagram to share a few snaps from the night out, was pleasantly surprised at how much he enjoyed the performance. 'Great night at #nickiminaj concert. Better than I expect it. Really enjoy it. Good night,' the Spanish defender wrote on the social media site. Mesut Ozil is congratulated by his team-mates after scoring during the 4-1 win on Saturday. Alexis Sanchez celebrates with Olivier Giroud after his stunning strike from just outside the penalty area. Hector Bellerin, Mesut Ozil, Alexis Sanchez and Olivier Giroud struck to condemn Liverpool to their second consecutive Premier League defeat as Jordan Henderson netted for the Reds.

Article: England must have played against worse teams than this St Kitts Invitational XI but, after a day that descended into near farce, it is difficult to think of any. Warm-up games can be low-key affairs but there cannot have been many times when an international side have been pitched against a team as bad as this. St Kitts were simply shambolic, so bad that Chigwell Cricket Club could give them a decent game, and an almost tragic example of the steep decline of Caribbean cricket. They were simply not fit for purpose. Jos Buttler appeals for a stumping as England dominated the second day of a farcical match in St Kitts. Mark Wood looked lively in his early spell after he was brought in for his first bowl for England. The statistics will say that England, having bowled St Kitts out for 59 on the first day of their opening two-day tour match, rattled up 379 for six declared with both Alastair Cook and Ian Bell retiring out. Then St Kitts, given just one session to hang on, capitulated again and finished on 76 for seven, narrowly avoiding handing England a hollow victory. The match was drawn, just about, and it should also have been hung and quartered. The modern fixture madness that will see England play 17 Tests in the next 10 months makes proper warm-ups almost impossible and is one of the main reasons why home teams nearly always win Test series these days. But when they are as meaningless as this it is questionable why it is even worth bothering. England may have spent time in the middle but they may as well have just turned up in Antigua next week to play the first of three Tests. Wood celebrates his first England wicket, but he is probably still a way off getting a first Test cap. Alastair Cook acknowledges the crowd after making a century, shortly before being retired out. Jos Battler had a short go at attacking the home bowlers before England declared with a mammoth 320 lead. For what it is worth, Bell and Joe Root made untroubled half-centuries yesterday after Cook had moved to his first century for England since the Ashes warm-up in Hobart 18 months ago and promptly retired. Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler then had a bit of a bash before England declared at the fall of Stokes just before tea, the small matter of 320 ahead. Then, in a move which further devalued the authenticity of the ‘contest,’ England brought Liam Plunkett and Mark Wood into the match for a work out. Wood, the Durham fast bowler, looked lively in his first bowl for England off his minimalist run-up and earned his first wicket when he bowled Shane Jeffers but it is unlikely to be enough to earn him a first Test cap just yet. Gary Ballance looked out of touch, the only real problem for England in a very comfortable match. Liam Plunkett charges in as England reduced their hosts to 24 for six in farcical circumstances. When St Kitts plummeted to 24 for six and almost had a batsman timed out before he emerged just in time with the Velcro on his pads barely fastened, the home side’s embarrassment was almost complete. Yet at least they regained a semblance of pride by holding on as England gave their two spinners a decent bowl, Akeem Saunders and Leon Clarke doing most to keep England at bay. The only place in England’s first Test team yet to be decided, it seems, is between Adil Rashid and James Tredwell for the sole spinner’s slot and Tredwell was the clear winner here, taking three wickets to Rashid’s one. The Yorkshireman will need to have a very good second match to edge out Tredwell. James Tredwell (left) outperformed Adil Rashid in the contest to be England's Test spinner next week. Buttler makes an unconventional stop as England came close to winning the game in just two days. The only concern for England will be the form of Gary Ballance who looked out of touch before falling for 16, the legacy perhaps of a World Cup where he somehow became a symbol of England’s unimaginative one-day thinking. England’s desperate attempt to get as much as they can from the second of these two warm-ups will tomorrow see them bowl 90 overs at St Kitts whatever happens and then bat for 90 overs on Thursday. The first cricket score of 225 for 25 could be recorded at Warner Park tomorrow and the once proud reputation of Caribbean cricket will most likely take another hit. Truly, it is a sad state of affairs.

England reduce Invitational XI to 24 for six after amassing lead of 320. Hosts hold out for a draw, but the game had descended into a farce. England will learn little from glorified net against woeful opposition. James Tredwell out-bowls Adil Rashid in contest to be Test spinner.

Article: (CNN)Authorities identified and charged a man Monday in connection with the discovery of human remains in a duffel bag in Cambridge, Massachusetts, over the weekend. Carlos Colina, 32, was arraigned on charges of assault and battery causing serious bodily injury and improper disposal of a body, the Middlesex District Attorney's Office said in a statement. "This was a gruesome discovery," said District Attorney Marian Ryan. "Detectives are continuing to analyze evidence and awaiting information from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner so that we may determine if additional charges are warranted." Police were notified Saturday morning about a suspicious item along a walkway in Cambridge. Officers arrived at the scene, opened a duffel bag and found human remains. After that discovery, police say, a surveillance video led them to an apartment building, where more body parts were discovered in a common area. That location is near the Cambridge Police Department headquarters. The remains at both locations belonged to the same victim, identified Monday as Jonathan Camilien, 26. Camilien and Colina knew each other, according to authorities. The next scheduled hearing in the case is set for April 14. CNN's Andreas Preuss contributed to this report.

The French defender was limping heavily and clutching his hamstring after a clearance on the edge of his own penalty area before being withdrawn after just 28 minutes at Ewood Park. Sakho was replaced by Kolo Toure, who partnered Dejan Lovren in a threadbare four-man defence with Emre Can and Martin Skrtel already unavailable. Mamadou Sakho limped off early on in Liverpool's 1-0 FA Cup sixth round replay win over Blackburn Rovers. Frenchman was limping heavily and clutching his hamstring after a clearance on the edge of his penalty area. German midfielder-cum-defender Can was serving a one match ban for a red card against Arsenal on Sunday, while Skrtel still has one game left of his three-game suspension for stamping on Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea last month. Sakho will undergo scans on Thursday to determine the extent of the injury but he is already a doubt for Liverpool's Barclays Premier League clash with Newcastle United on Monday. Rodgers, who has tended to select three central defenders before the FA Cup replay, will be hoping the 25-year-old can return to action as soon as possible.

Article: Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure is a dream target for Inter Milan, according to general director Marco Fassone. The Italian giants are keen to sign the 31-year-old this summer, a player Inter coach Roberto Mancini knows well having guided him from 2010 until 2013 at the Barclays Premier League club. Gazzetta dello Sport claim Inter are prepared to submit an offer of 60million euros (£43million) for the Ivory Coast international, who is under contract with the Blues outfit until June 2017. Serie A side Inter Milan hope to sign Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure (front) this summer. Inter general director Marco Fassone fears City's asking price and Toure's wages could be too much. 'Who doesn't dream of having a player like him? Toure would give our midfield line something that we are lacking,' Fassone told Italian sports newspaper Tuttosport. 'But his wages and City's asking price might be a big obstacle.' Toure has scored seven goals and set up one more in 22 Premier League appearances this term for City. Inter are also working on new deals for their Argentina forward Mauro Icardi and Croatia midfielder Mateo Kovacic. Icardi is Inter's top scorer this season with 15 goals and is tied to the Nerazzurri for a further three seasons, while Kovacic, who is a reported target of Liverpool, is under contract with inter until June 2019. Inter striker Mauro Icardi is on the verge of signing a new contract with the club, according to Marco Fassone. Mateo Kovacic, pictured celebrating a goal against Cagliari, is also in talks over an extended deal. 'We are almost there with respect to Icardi's contract extension,' Fassone said. 'We want to keep him just as we want to keep Kovacic. 'We will evaluate with great care (their) eventual offers. 'It's clear that if we want to sign three players (this summer) we will need to evaluate those that will depart.' Inter's priority right now is to tie Inter goalkeeper Samir Handanovic to a long-term contract. Goalkeeper Samir Handanovic, pictured against Napoli, has been linked with Roma and Manchester United. The Slovenia international has been linked with Roma as well as Manchester United and becomes a free agent next season. 'Handanovic's renewal is an issue that we must resolve at once,' Fassone said. 'We need to understand what he wants. 'We cannot go into next season knowing that our goalkeeper's contract expires.' Inter are currently 10th in Serie A with 10 league games remaining.

Article: Rangers insist that their fans have no cause for alarm over badges and other trademarks being registered with Sports Direct — as they will return to the club when a £5million loan is repaid. The Ibrox board last week launched a probe into claims Mike Ashley’s firm had taken ownership of intellectual property, including the club’s famous crests. However, they are satisfied the position stems solely from the security attached to the loan from Sports Direct, accepted by the former regime in January. ‘It has been widely reported that the trademarks, the iconic symbols of our club, are now in the possession of Sports Direct,’ said a club statement. ‘Although the trademarks are registered in Sports Direct’s name, the position is not as alarming as it may first appear. Newcastle owner Mike Ashley is a divisive figure north and south of the border. ‘Rangers remain the rightful and legal owners of their trademarks and interim chairman Paul Murray has clarified this position with Sports Direct. Both parties will come together within the next two weeks for talks. ‘Confusion over ownership arose last week when it was noticed on a Government Intellectual Property site that they appeared to be the possessions of Sports Direct but this was as a consequence of the loan facility entered into by the previous board. In return for the loan, Sports Direct took security over all Rangers assets — but not Ibrox — including intellectual property owned by the club. ‘In England, it is possible to secure such rights by a fixed charge, but in Scotland, the equivalent of an English fixed charge can only be granted over heritable property — land and buildings. The Rangers board have reassured fans that the club still owns trademarks and the badge. ‘Accordingly, a practice has developed of lenders taking absolute transfers subject to a back-letter setting out that the transfer is in security and the property will be returned when the facility has been repaid. This is a common device adopted by most of the UK banks and lenders. ‘Rangers supporters can be reassured that Sports Direct fully accept that all of the IP rights registered in their name will be returned to the club when the loan facility of £5million is repaid.’ Kenny Miller wears the club's famous badge on his shirt as he gestures during an outing for Rangers.

Henderson and Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet both played their 47th game of season in the 2-0 win over Newcastle United on Monday night, equalling the record for appearances by any player in the top five European leagues so far this campaign.

'We knew it was an important game for us,' Henderson said 'Obviously the last couple of weeks in the Premier League have been disappointing both with performances and results. We knew today we needed to put that right and I think we did that with a great result for us. 'We've got ground to make up but we'll just keep going, keep winning in games and putting in performances. Come the end of the season, you never know.'

Article: (CNN)This is the end. Beautiful friend, the end. For the 1960s, the end arrived with -- depending on your ideals and your tribe -- either the Rolling Stones' Altamont fiasco in December 1969, the Kent State shootings in May 1970 or Richard Nixon's 1972 re-election. For "Mad Men," the "end of an era," as its slogan has it, begins Sunday. Over the past eight years, the show about a 1960s advertising agency and its collision with changing times has become part of the national fabric, if never a huge ratings hit. Stores have created fashion lines inspired by the show; there have been "Mad Men" cocktails and "Mad Men" museum exhibits and even "Mad Men" presidential references. Don Draper, the creative director played by Jon Hamm, has become a symbol of the times -- his and, sometimes, ours. Its subjects have taken the show to heart. In March, a "Mad Men" bench was unveiled in front of New York's Time & Life Building, where the fictional firm of Sterling Cooper & Partners has its headquarters. The end of a TV series brings with it some risk. "The Sopranos," "Mad Men" creator Matthew Weiner's former employer, divided fans with its famous cut-to-black finale. On the other hand, "Mad Men's" former AMC stablemate, "Breaking Bad," was saluted for an almost perfect landing. Speaking of landings: The last season -- technically, the first half of season 7 -- ended with the moon landing in July 1969. Though Weiner and his cast have been typically tight-lipped -- Weiner even hid the finale from his cast at first -- it's reasonable to assume the new season will pick up soon afterward. What's going to happen? Here are some educated guesses. With the '60s screaming towards their conclusion, "Mad Men" probably won't jump ahead much. The latter half of 1969 included the Manson murders, the Woodstock festival, a New York mayoral campaign and the Vietnam War moratorium demonstrations -- plenty of fodder for the characters to interact with, if only tangentially. Who knows? The show might even mention the Miracle Mets. It would be a nice way to acknowledge the agency's late Lane Pryce. Of course, Weiner might have a different idea; he's from Baltimore. "Mad Men" is generally a show about disintegration, reflective of the '60s themselves. The old orders are falling apart: white-shoe WASP firms like Sterling Cooper giving way to the ethnic pace-setters such as Doyle Dane Bernbach; grimy New York replaced by sunny Los Angeles; the "Good War" generation butting heads with the "Make Love, Not War" cohort; vacuum tubes and ledger books being displaced by a sleek, solid-state IBM world. It's all an ad agency can do to keep up. Last season saw plenty of intraoffice turmoil, thanks to the ill-fitting merger between Sterling Cooper and former rival Cutler Gleason and Chaough. Though the agency survived, it's now without Bert Cooper (Robert Morse) and under the ownership of (real-life) Madison Avenue titan McCann Erickson. That's not a recipe for long-term survival, and expect a number of longtime characters -- Ken Cosgrove (Aaron Staton), Harry Crane (Rich Sommer) and perhaps even Joan Harris (Christina Hendricks) -- to look for an exit. Roger Sterling -- the wisecracking executive played by John Slattery -- might find an exit as well, but not one he's anticipating. He's suffered two heart attacks. He drinks to excess. He's never grown up. Bet on a sudden and shocking departure. On the other hand, Peggy Olson's star has continued to rise (much like one of the character's models, advertising wunderkind Mary Wells Lawrence). She left Sterling Cooper once; indeed, she wouldn't have returned if her new agency hadn't merged with her old one. If Olson, played by Elisabeth Moss, bolts the firm, it will probably be to head her own agency -- and possibly get married. That is, if she's still interested in such an old-fashioned tradition. In recent seasons, Don's ex-wife, Betty (January Jones), has lost herself amid all the turmoil. She sees herself through the eyes of her spouses, and though husband Henry Francis (Christopher Stanley) has been far more supportive than Don, he's a busy man. And Sally, Don's daughter (Kiernan Shipka), is proving to be a handful. On the one hand, she's obviously bright; on the other, she's a teenager and starting to rebel. In recent seasons she's run away and started sneaking cigarettes, and she's always fighting with her mother. You could see her hitchhiking to Woodstock, or at least dropping out of school. Anything's possible, but given all that the character has been through -- divorces, affairs, office politics, morose late-night rides with Glen Bishop -- it's a bit on the nose, isn't it? Instead, try this: It's April 1, 1970. Richard Nixon is signing legislation banning cigarette ads on radio and television, reminding Don of the day 10 years earlier when he came up with the Lucky Strike campaign that began the series. No fool, he had seen this day coming years before. He'll fix himself a drink, ponder buying an avocado-colored refrigerator, clean out his ashtray and leave the show the way he arrived: on top of the zeitgeist, unable to accept his past and utterly, inscrutably alone.

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence. The final season of the TV series "Mad Men" is set to premiere on Sunday, marking the end of an era for the show's characters and the 1960s. The show's creator, Matthew Weiner, has been tight-lipped about the finale, but

Article: Kevin Pietersen is being urged to make the England selectors' lives difficult after his barnstorming start to the summer. England's exiled record run-scorer made 170 off 149 balls against MCC Universities Oxford at The Parks on Sunday, at the start of Surrey's three-day fixture. Former England captains Alec Stewart, Pietersen's boss as Surrey director of cricket, and Nasser Hussain have since both had their say on the 34-year-old's chances of a return to the Test arena. Kevin Pietersen in action for Surrey on day two of the three-day match against Oxford MCCU. Pietersen (centre) pictured with his Surrey team-mates at The Parks on Monday. Stewart is hoping Pietersen can further his quest when Surrey face Glamorgan in their first LV= County Championship fixture next week - while Hussain insists England's selectors need to clarify with a'very public decision' once and for all whether the controversial South Africa-born batsman has any prospects of playing for his adopted country again. Pietersen's impressive return to long-form cricket 14 months after his England sacking was timely, on the eve of the first Test against the West Indies which began 4,000 miles away in Antigua on Monday. Stewart said: 'Anyone who scores runs will ask questions of the selectors. 'Kevin shouldn't look any further than the next innings, whether it's here or down at Cardiff. 'If he strings hundreds together - and the reason we signed him is because we want him to score hundreds, double-hundreds, help us win games and be successful - it will be interesting to see where it may lead to. 'No one has got any idea whether Kevin Pietersen will play for England again. 'The only people that know that are those who are currently picking the England side. 'At the moment he's not being considered, because he hasn't played red ball cricket for the last 14 months.' Pietersen chills out against the fence as Oxford MCCU bat on Monday. Alec Stewart (right) believes that Pietersen could make it difficult for the England selectors. Hussain is impressed that Pietersen has already proved he is serious about a recall, and he is adamant the England and Wales Cricket Board must 'watch out' for him. 'He could easily go off and get his IPL contract and play over there,' Hussain said on Sky Sports 2. 'He's decided to give it another go... people say 'Oh, 170 against Oxford - it was only Oxford'. 'But as a player who has played 100 Test matches to turn up at The Parks and smash 170 shows how determined he is - so I'd watch out, if I was a selector.' Hussain senses Pietersen will not be easily deterred, unless England spell out that they do not want him. 'This is not a lad that's going to go away, and the ECB need to make a decision on Kevin Pietersen - make a very public decision on him, whether he is available for selection or not,' he said. 'I know the chairman elect, Colin Graves, has said that he is. 'But it needs to come from the selectors.' Pietersen believes last week's departure of Paul Downton - the ECB managing director who described him as 'disengaged' - has offered him an England 'lifeline' even as he approaches the veteran stage of his record-breaking career. Stewart, who played for England until the age of 40, added: 'Whether you're 18 or 38, if you're good enough, then I believe you take the age factor out of the occasion. 'If you're performing, surely you've got to be warranting a place in the team.' Pietersen made 170 runs off 149 balls during his stint with the bat in Oxford on Sunday. Pietersen fielding on Monday afternoon as the 34-year-old makes his county cricket return. He hopes Pietersen can boost Surrey's championship promotion prospects, and was encouraged by his comeback. 'It was a very good innings,' Stewart added. 'He had to get used to playing red ball cricket again - lining it up, letting it go - and then he showed what a quality batsman he is, which we all know but we just haven't seen it because he's only played 20-over cricket. 'We've signed Kevin because he's a top-class player. 'Will he play for England? We don't know. All we're going to do is enjoy having Kevin around, scoring as many runs as he can. 'Next game, next innings, is the next most important one.' Pietersen had a quieter second day back in his whites. He fielded at mid-off and slip as Surrey's hosts dug in after resuming on 28 for four. Jack McIver top-scored with 83, hitting 11 fours and a six, in the students' 224 all out. Chris Tremlett, another England Test player, took five for 30. Surrey reshuffled their batting order in the second innings, and Pietersen was left to watch on as they reached 182 for three - Zafar Ansari making 53 towards a lead of 378 entering Tuesday's final day.

Article: Jolyon Palmer is determined to claim a place in Formula One next year after being given the perfect opportunity by Lotus to prove himself worthy. For the first time the Enstone-based marque are providing their test and reserve driver with a number of outings in Friday's first practice session ahead of grand prix weekends. Ordinarily in the past, Lotus' reserve has been nothing more than a spare part, stood on the sidelines whilst the race drivers completed their tasks. Jolyon Palmer will drive in every Friday practice session for Lotus this season. This year, however, Lotus have decided Palmer will get a shot, and not just as a driver doing all the donkey work too. Every Friday Palmer will be behind the wheel - as was the case in China last week and again in Bahrain this week - his run-plan will be similar to that of whoever he replaces. In China, Palmer was only 0.6secs behind Pastor Maldonado at the end of FP1, a tremendous effort given it was Palmer's first major outing at an F1 event. If Palmer can continue to push, or even on occasion better the times of Maldonado and team-mate Romain Grosjean, doors may open. 'I want to be really pushing the race drivers. That's the aim,' said Palmer. 'I'm pretty much running on the same run plan as those guys. It's not like we've seen in FP1 sessions before with other drivers where they have been on quali settings, engine turned up or low fuel. 'This year there's a direct comparison and I want to show why I should be racing next year.' Unfortunately for last year's GP2 champion, his lack of competitive work outside of his duties with Lotus may prove a hindrance. Palmer drives  during practice for the Chinese Grand Prix last weekend. The 24-year-old from Horsham would love to be keeping his hand in, but knows it is something he has to sacrifice to keep his F1 dream alive. 'I want to race, but only if I get the right offer,' added Palmer, son of former F1 driver Jonathan. 'If I get a good offer to do something that would be a good career move for me then I'd like to race. 'It's about keeping sharp. It's the one thing I'm missing this year. 'I'm loving working with Lotus and being in F1, but I'd love to be racing as well, so if I get a good offer I'd love to.' Palmer, though, is not actively seeking further employment because of his commitment to Lotus, adding: 'My main focus is all here and I'm really busy anyway. 'If something came my way then I would definitely consider it, but my main priority is Lotus and I will not compromise anything I do here by racing elsewhere. 'But if there is something that came along that could fit in with this then I'd be happy to do it.'

Jolyon Palmer will drive in every Friday practice session for Lotus. The Bit is determined to seize his chance with the team. In China, he was only 0.6 seconds behind Pastor Maldonado.

Article: Juventus goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon has no immediate plans to retire and said it would be a waste to quit now when he feels he is still in top form. 'A player stops when he feels that he is no longer what he was before on the pitch,' Buffon, 37, told reporters after Juventus beat Monaco 1-0 in the Champions League on Tuesday. 'Looking at it objectively, that is not my case. I will continue to keep playing as long as I am doing well, otherwise it would be a waste. Why bid farewell to football if you are playing well?' Juventus goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon says he is not thinking about retiring because he is still playing well. The Italy international produced a solid display to stop Monaco from scoring an away goal on Tuesday night. The Juventus captain celebrates after his side recorded a 1-0 win in the first leg of the quarter-final. 'At the first sign of slipping, I would be the first to bow out. I think one should stop playing when goes onto the field and you see that you are no longer the same person,' he added. Buffon, who has helped Juventus win three successive Serie A titles and is still Italy's first-choice goalkeeper, made three important saves to deny Monaco an away goal in Tuesday's game. Buffon joined Juventus from Parma in 2001, and stayed with them even after they were demoted to Serie B following the Calciopoli match-fixing scandal in 2006, the same year he helped Italy win the World Cup.

Article: (CNN)Just kill it already. That was the sentiment of many "Vampire Diaries" fans on Tuesday after star Nina Dobrev announced she will be leaving the CW show at the end of this season. "I always knew I wanted Elena's story to be a six season adventure, and within those six years I got the journey of a lifetime," she posted on her social media accounts after a "goodbye party" at Lake Lanier outside Atlanta, where the show is filmed. "I was a human, a vampire, a doppelganger, a crazy immortal, a doppelganger pretending to be human, a human pretending to be a doppelganger. I got kidnapped, killed, resurrected, tortured, cursed, body-snatched, was dead and undead, and there's still so much more to come before the season finale in May." And while that may be true, fans were feeling a little jilted. Many chastised the show's producers, some even Dobrev herself, for allowing the show to go on to a seventh season this fall after she departs. Many were upset that Dobrev's departure could sink hopes of seeing a satisfying denouement to the relationship between Dobrev's character, Elena Gilbert, and love interest vampire Damon Salvatore. Fans called the couple "Delena." "I feel angry, sad, depressed, numb but most of all I feel like part of me died along with Nina leaving TVD. Nothing will be the same again," Twitter user iDamonAndElena posted. Producer Julie Plec issued a statement supporting Dobrev's decision. "Nina is excited to spread her wings, get some rest, travel the world and also take it by storm, and we support her a thousand-fold," she said in the statement, according to media accounts. "We will miss Nina and the four hundred characters she played, but we look forward to the insane and exciting challenge of continuing to tell stories of our Salvatore Brothers and our much-loved and gifted ensemble." No thanks, some fans said. Dobrev seemed to anticipate the pain, urging fans to hold on through the show's finale next month. "If you think you know what's coming, you don't," she said.

Article: Harry Redknapp has claimed 'people with their own agendas' had a hand in his resignation as QPR manager, describing the situation as 'a bit of a soap opera'. The 68-year-old blamed knee problems for his decision to leave the Barclays Premier League strugglers in February. However, Redknapp told BBC Sport's Football Focus there was more to his decision than health problems. Ex-QPR boss Harry Redknapp has described the club as 'like a bit of a soap opera' after quitting in February. Striker Charlie Austin celebrates after scoring in QPR's 3-3 draw with Aston Villa on Tuesday night. He said: 'I always thought I had everyone pulling with me and suddenly I felt some were and some weren't. I didn't know who was on my side at the end and who wasn't. 'Behind the scenes, I always thought there were one or two people with their own agendas. 'There was always talk about Tim Sherwood coming in. It was like a bit of a soap opera. 'QPR was in the paper every day. I've been at lots of other clubs, big clubs as well, where you didn't get that. That got on my nerves. That was the big problem for me. 'As soon as we lost a few games, it would begin. I always thought there was someone mischievous causing it. I'd never had that before at any club I'd been at. Redknapp was aware of constant talk of Tim Sherwood replacing him at Loftus Road earlier in the season. Former West Ham boss Redknapp believes he would have helped QPR avoid relegation. 'I didn't see the teams below us getting the same sort of headlines every other week. It wore me down a little bit.' Redknapp left the team second from bottom of the table and they are now two points from safety under the leadership of Chris Ramsey. However, Redknapp, who also claimed he did not fall out with chairman Tony Fernandes because of the club's lack of business in the January transfer window, added: 'I felt I'd have kept them up.'

Article: New Delhi, India (CNN)Police have arrested four employees of a popular Indian ethnic-wear chain after a minister spotted a security camera overlooking the changing room of one of its stores. Federal education minister Smriti Irani was visiting a FabIndia outlet in the tourist resort state of Goa on Friday when she discovered a surveillance camera pointed at the changing room, police said. Four employees of the store have been arrested, but its manager -- herself a woman -- was still at large Saturday, said Goa police superintendent Kartik Kashyap. State authorities launched their investigation right after Irani levied her accusation. They found an overhead camera that the minister had spotted and determined that it was indeed able to take photos of customers using the store's changing room, according to Kashyap. After the incident, authorities sealed off the store and summoned six top officials from FabIndia, he said. The arrested staff have been charged with voyeurism and breach of privacy, according to the police. If convicted, they could spend up to three years in jail, Kashyap said. Officials from FabIndia -- which sells ethnic garments, fabrics and other products -- are heading to Goa to work with investigators, according to the company. "FabIndia is deeply concerned and shocked at this allegation," the company said in a statement. "We are in the process of investigating this internally and will be cooperating fully with the police."

Article: A fortunate deflection from an audacious Nigel de Jong overhed kick saw AC Milan salvage a draw and frustrate European hopefuls Sampdoria at the San Siro on Sunday night. Former Samuel Eto'o provided the deft pass to nutmeg Philippe Mexes and find Roberto Soriano to open the scoring just before the hour mark with an emphatic finish from the top of the box. Milan were back level on 74 minutes when Nigel de Jong's spectacular effort which was headed straight for keeper Emiliano Viviano but found the back of the net off Alfred Duncan's leg. Nigel de Jong's spectacular overhead kick that levelled for AC Milan against Sampdoria on Sunday night. The Dutch midfielder attempted the audacious shot following a poor corner clearance at the San Siro. De Jong celebrates with Luca Antonelli after his strike took a massive deflection off Alfred Duncan's leg. AC Milan: D. Lopez; Abate (De Sciglio 71'), Paletta, Mexes, Antonelli; Van Ginkel, De Jong, Bonaventura; Cerci (Suso 62'), Destro (Pazzini (77'), Menez. Subs not used: Rami, Poli, Zapata, Bocchetti, Bonera, Abbiati, Alex, Mastalli, Donnarumma. Goal: De Jong. Sampdoria: Viviano; De Silvestri (Wszolek 88'), Silvestre, Romagnoli, Mesbah; Palombo, Obiang; Eder, Soriano (Duncan (66'), Eto'o; Okaka (Muriel 73') Subs not used: Correa, Bergessio, Munoz, Rizzo, Coda, Djordjevic, Acquah, Marchionni, Romero, Frison. Goal: Soriano. De Jong was lucky to be on the pitch after a late and dangerous sliding tackle went unpunished in the first half before he finally made it into the referee's book for leading with his elbow, an action that could have seen him sent off. With European involvement pretty much a pipe dream now for Filippo Inzaghi's side, who sit eighth seven points behind fifth-placed Fiorentina, the best they can hope for is to ruin the hopes of their rivals. Sampdoria could have moved ahead of Napoli in fourth into the first of the two Europa League qualification spots but are instead sixth in the Serie A behind Fiorentina on goal difference. They are eight points shy of third-placed Roma in the last of the Champions League places. A large section of supporters continued their protests against the club's management with banners reading 'Vendesi', meaning 'for sale', along with signs with names of star players who have been sold, and a #SaveACMilan message. Fans want owner Silvio Berlusconi to sell the club amid reports of interest from investors from China and Thailand. At least their side's improved on the field with a recent form turnaround. Sampdoria's Roberto Soriano drives his shot from the edge of the box for the opener against AC Milan. The i Blucerchiati players gather around Soriano as his impressive finish gives them the lead. Former Chelsea striker Samuel Eto'o gives a celebratory fist pump after his pass laid on the opening goal. Here Marco van Ginkel was dangerous from distance for Milan forcing Emiliano Viviano into action inside 15 minutes and was only just off target moments later. Destro, who left the field late in proceedings on a stretcher, headed a quality cross straight to Viviano on 30 minutes and did the same with a volley less than 10 minutes later. Alessio Cerci also squandered a chance from just outside the box over the crossbar. A different Sampdoria came out after the break and almost took the lead through Stefano Okaka and Eder, who was well saved by Diego Lopez at full stretch. AC Milan's supporters hold posters reading 'Vendesi' (meaning for sale) at the San Siro. Fans are growing increasingly disillusioned with those in charge of their club. A composed Eto'o orchestrated the deadlock breaker, taking the ample time he was gifted before threading his pass through the legs of fiery Mexes to a virtually lonesome Soriano just inside the box. The German-born Italian then casually slotted his shot to Lopez's right. But they couldn't hold onto the lead as De Jong's tried his luck to become the unlikely hero. And substitute Suso could have snatched the points late when his curling shot clattered into the post about fives minutes from the final whistle.

Article: Matej Vydra's superb volley helped keep Watford on the trail for automatic promotion as they recorded a 2-0 victory over a spirited Millwall side, who sank further into relegation trouble. Millwall were on top for much of the first half but a stunning hit from Vydra saw the Hornets take in a slender advantage at half-time. Aiden O'Brien was a constant menace for the hosts - who had an early penalty shout turned down - but Watford were far too clinical, as Adlene Guedioura slotted a vital second goal shortly after the break. Matej Vydra fires home his stunning volley from the edge of the box to put Watford into the lead. Vydra is congratulated by his Watford team-mates as his goal moved the club towards automatic promotion. Millwall keeper David Forde was called into action in the first minute, doing well to deny Troy Deeney after the striker had broken the offside trap. The Lions quickly gathered momentum and despite some promising approach play - with O'Brien at the heart of much of it - failed to create any meaningful opportunities. And the home side had a legitimate penalty shout after Ben Watson bundled over of Ed Upson, as the midfielder jinked in from the right, but that went unpunished. After Watford weathered the storm, Vydra produced his moment of inspiration by volleying in from just outside the box in the 26th minute. Forde was helpless as the Czech thumped the ball into the far corner from Ikechi Anya's cross. Millwall, playing with renewed hope of survival after a first win in 10 on Good Friday, then squandered a golden opportunity when Martyn Woolford failed to pick out O'Brien lurking unmarked two yards from goal. Adlene Guedioura celebrates in front of the travelling fans after making it 2-0 and sealing the three points. Troy Deeney, who went close early on, is tackled by Millwall's Shaun Williams during the Championship clash. The hosts also ended the half in the ascendency as Jimmy Abdou's scuffed shot was well saved by Heurelho Gomes. Millwall huffed and puffed as they had in the first-half, but created few chances of any note. They came closest to boosting their slim survival hopes when O'Brien robbed Matthew Connolly of possession, but Gomes saved well. In the 54th minute, Anya - as he did for Vydra's opener - created Watford's second. The Scottish winger combined with Troy Deeney to outfox Shaun Cummings and Sid Nelson before squaring for Guedioura, who tucked away a six-yard tap-in. Deeney dives in to stop Dan Harding getting past, as Millwall slipped closer to relegation. It was a goal that Watford's second-half performance deserved, as they overcame Millwall's superiority before the break to showcase the quality that puts them on the brink of the Premier League. They twice came close to adding to the lead, as first Vydra then Odion Ighalo ran free on goal. Forde managed to gather the ball at Vydra's feet and then saved agilely from substitute Ighalo. Avoiding defeat would have equalled their longest unbeaten run of the season at four games, but the Lions more than likely need to go without a loss in all five of their remaining fixtures to stand any chance of beating the drop.

Matej Vydra converts Ikechi Anya cross after 26 mintues. Adlene Guadeioura doubles Hornets advantage in second half. Millwall remain seven points from safety, and are second from bottom.

Article: Tracey Neville would say she has never lived in the shadow of her footballing brothers. She might not have enjoyed their fame or their financial success. At the peak of her career as an England netball player who won bronze medals at the Commonwealth Games and World Cup, she earned just £742 a month. But there has been no shortage of ambition and no lack of personality. She is Phil Neville's twin and I ask her which of them, back on January 21, 1977, emerged first. 'I don't think there was ever any way Philip was coming out before me,' she says in a broad Bury accent enriched by an endearing burst of laughter. Tracey Neville, pictured at Hotel Football in Manchester, is Phil Neville's twin and sister to Gary Neville. Neville gives a team talk to her Manchester Thunder players during a match with Surrey Storm last year. England coach and Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville poses with his sister Tracey and her friends. It might explain why it is Tracey who has risen to the rank of national head coach first, taking England's netball team to this summer's World Cup in Australia while her brothers continue to combine coaching and broadcasting. Gary has spent the past three years as assistant to England manager Roy Hodgson. Tracey was parachuted into the top job on an interim basis last month and will select a squad of 12 for the tournament in August. Winning it will be no easy task, even if England are ranked third in the world. They failed to win a medal in last year's Commonwealth Games and poor results in a recent Test series convinced netball chiefs to turn to 38-year-old Neville, who has performed impressively as the boss at Manchester Thunder. How England perform will impact on funding with up to £4million at stake. The pressure is on. She revived an ageing Thunder team with an injection of youth and has secured two Superleague titles in three years. They are top of the league and later this month will contest their Superleague semi-final at the Manchester Arena, with some suggesting there are echoes of a certain local football team. Like Gary and Phil, she was first capped for her country at 19, eventually making 81 international appearances before a knee injury forced her to retire — and she says her personality is probably a mixture of the brothers'. Sportsmail's Chief Sports Reporter, Matt Lawton, interviews Neville over breakfast at Hotel Football. Phil Neville, who now works as pundit with BT Sport and the BBC, takes a selfie with his twin sister. Neville celebrates with her Manchester Thunder team after clinching the Superleague title in April last year. 'I think we're all natural leaders,' she says as she tucks into a cooked breakfast at Hotel Football, which stands next to Old Trafford and counts her brothers and Manchester United's other 'Class of 92' players among its main investors. 'I'd say I'm quite intense, like Gary. He and I would clash quite a lot. Not to the detriment of our relationship. We're very close. But Philip would be the mediator.' So Phil's the nice one? 'I think I am,' she says, chuckling again. 'I'm probably not as intense as Gary and I'm not the mediator that Philip is. I'm somewhere in the middle. I have bits of both personality traits. 'But I can definitely hold my own with the two of them. I'm probably the one who winds Gary up, to be honest. Being a girl I probably know how to push his buttons.' She says she was never dazzled by the success her brothers enjoyed at United or by the fact that Gary's best mate was David Beckham. 'I knew them all when they were earning £29.50 a week in digs,' she says. And she claims never to have been the sister her brothers turned to for fashion or girlfriend advice. 'We never had those kind of conversations,' she says. 'And Gary and clothes? I don't think they are ever in the same conversation really (cue more laughter). Neville, who will manage England at the netball World Cup, believes she is a natural leader like her brothers. Gary Neville (left) leads Wayne Rooney, James Milner and Michael Carrick (L-R) in England training. Neville represents England at the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur aged just 21. 'But we have an awesome dynamic. We obviously all have a competitive edge but not to the detriment of each other. As kids we were like a pack of cubs. We always looked after our own and that's still the case today. We rely on that support system.' Even as kids, her brothers treated her as an equal. 'I was never a girl they put in the field when we played cricket or in goal when we played football,' she says. 'I was always pretty good at all sports and I would give it my all. 'I would have been a good footballer. I loved playing. My mum was the footballer in the family. She played as a striker. That didn't rub off because like Gary and Phil I was a defender. In the end the big decision I had to make was between hockey and netball. I'd made some good friends in netball so that was the option I took.' Understandably, there is what she describes as 'a certain connection' with Phil. 'We probably speak more,' she says. 'Because Gary's so busy I would see more of his family, his kids, than I do him. 'He never talks about himself. He won the award last week (best sports presenter at the RTS Awards) and nobody in the family even knew he was up for it. He wouldn't say he wants to be the next England manager because his focus will be on the job he's doing at the moment. And when I told Gary I'd got this job, it was just a one-word text response. 'Brilliant,' he said. There was more from Philip. 'Unbelievable. So proud.' I think he tweeted something. That's the difference.' Before Australia she will draw on the experience of both brothers. Phil spent a season as assistant coach to David Moyes at Manchester United. Given the opportunity she would also like to pick the brains of Sir Alex Ferguson. Neville would love to have a coffee with Sir Alex Ferguson and pick his brains before the netball World Cup. Phil Neville spent last season on the coaching staff at Manchester United, with 10 months under David Moyes. Neville has worked in hospitality and earned a maths degree in Bristol and sports science degree in Chester. 'If he wouldn't mind having a coffee with me I'd love to do that,' she says. 'But I've got 30 minutes booked in with Gary. 'There are certain challenges in our sport. It's difficult for the girls to be full-time, and often their jobs become more important because there isn't the financial support. 'I had some difficult financial times as a player. I had great support from my family but I had to take different jobs to support myself. 'I worked in hospitality and got into coaching education and I studied too. I got a maths degree in Bristol before studying for a sports science degree in Chester. These days I'm working with girls who are doctors, lawyers, zoologists. 'But I think I'm a better coach than I ever was a player. One of my strengths is the integration of young players and the way I build a team around a certain ethos. I also have a good understanding of the game.' The challenge is nevertheless significant, as Australia and New Zealand are the powerhouses in netball. 'The Sport England target is to get to the final but we've never made a final before,' she says. 'Last year we finished fourth in the Commonwealths. The team didn't perform to their best so it's my job to get them doing that. 'Ideally I'd like to have had longer to prepare. In a perfect world you'd get a four-year cycle. 'Right now the future beyond the World Cup is uncertain. We'll just have to see how it goes. But I had to take this opportunity. I've always had such passion for England.' She's certainly not alone there. lnformation on Manchester Thunder's semi-final at the Manchester Arena is at www.manchesterthunder.com.

Article: (CNN)Nine British citizens were arrested in Turkey on Wednesday, suspected of trying to cross illegally into Syria, the Turkish military said on its website. The group included four children -- the oldest being 10 or 11, with the youngest born in 2013, a Turkish official told CNN on condition of anonymity. The nine were arrested at the Turkey-Syria border, the Turkish military said. It didn't say why the group allegedly was trying to get into Syria, which has been torn by a roughly four-year war between Syrian government forces and Islamist extremist groups and other rebels. Among the war's combatants is ISIS, which has taken over parts of Syria and Iraq for what it claims is its Islamic caliphate, and which is known to have been recruiting Westerners. Accompanying the children were three men and two women; all nine had British passports, the Turkish official said. UK police charge man with terror offenses after Turkey trip. The British Foreign Office said Wednesday that it is aware of reports of the arrests and that it is seeking information about the incident from Turkish authorities. CNN's Gul Tuysuz reported from Istanbul, and Elaine Ly reported from London. CNN's Jason Hanna contributed to this report.

Article: Chris Smalling has made the brave move of joining the Twitter-sphere, just days before his side meets rivals Manchester City at Old Trafford. The 25-year-old is very much a key part of Manchester United's defence under Louis van Gaal and is quickly establishing himself as one of the best defenders in the country. Smalling, appeared to be enjoying a barbecue with some friends and his girlfriend Sam Cooke, as he posted his first photo captioned, 'BBQ Time #biggreenegg.' Chris Smalling posted this photo of himself and girlfriend Sam Cooke on his newly opened Twitter. In a game, neither side can afford to lose, United would be able to extend their lead to four points as they continue to chase down Arsenal for the second automatic Champions League qualification place. As United continue to find their good form, Manuel Pellegrini's side are struggling and Monday's defeat to Crystal Palace was damning for morale, as they look to stop their slide down the table. Smalling, who missed the win over Aston Villa, could return for United as they look to cement their place in the Champions League. The 25-year-old is establishing himself as one of the best centre backs in England and continues to impress. His United team-mate Adnan Januzaj has also joined the social networking site and said: 'Hi Twitter! This is my official account looking forward to sharing with you all #MUFC #FirstTweet.' The winger has found game time under Louis van Gaal hard to come by and could choose to leave the club in the summer in search of first-team football. Januzaj burst onto the scene last season under David Moyes but struggles to fit into the Dutchman's style of play and has found himself on the fringes. Adnan Januzaj joined Twitter on Friday and just days before their crucial clash with Manchester City. The Belgian international has found his game time limited this season under new boss Louis van Gaal.

Article: Fergal O'Brien is daring to dream what might be at Aintree on Saturday as he insists last year's fourth Alvarado is going into the race in better shape this time around. The 10-year-old gelding has run only once this season, finishing fifth at Doncaster in February. But Limerick-born O'Brien, 42, believes that is preferable a preferable situation to 12 months ago when Alvarado went into the race not having run since pulling up at Cheltenham on New Year's Day. Fergal O'Brien says that Alvarado is in better shape going into this weekend's Grand National at Aintree. That is showing in his contender's demeanour of Paul Moloney's at home, O'Brien said. The trainer added: 'I think we are in a better position. He is very straightforward in that if he is eating well and you can get him in the field he is pretty well in himself. 'I actually think we are a bit further on than we were last year.' O'Brien spent 18 years working for trainer Nigel Twiston-Davies, 16 of them as Head Lad. During that time, he helped prepare two National winners in Earth Summit and Bindaree but, with duties back at base, last year was the first time he had ever been at Aintree on National day. Alvarado, pictured here at Cheltenham in 2013, has run only once this season back in February at Doncaster. O'Brien added: 'I said all along if Alvarado jumped the first couple of fences and enjoyed it he would run well. He has an awful lot of ability, although you don't always get it from him. He is not ungenuine but because he is quirky.' Gary Moore-trained 2014 Champion Chase winner Sire De Grugy runs over two and a half miles for the first time on Friday when he heads the 10 runners in the Melling Chase. Josh Moore rides in place of injured brother Jamie. Sire De Grugy jumps a fence on his way to victory in the Champion Chase at Cheltenham last year.

Article: An independent panel of concussion experts formed by the Football Association will meet for the first time in May. The panel of eight medical professionals will advise the FA on what can be done to make the game safer. Head injuries have been under greater scrutiny since Hugo Lloris refused to be substituted following a clash with Romelu Lukaku in 2013, with new rules introduced at the start of the current Barclays Premier League season stating a player suffering a head injury must leave the pitch and only be allowed to return if cleared by a club doctor. The FA have formed a concussion experts panel to help figure out how to make the game safer for players. Recently, the Jeff Astle Foundation has been raising awareness of the danger of long-term head injuries from playing football, with former West Brom player Astle having died in 2002 of a brain trauma caused by heading heavy leather footballs during his career. This weekend saw West Brom wear retro kits against Leicester on Saturday as the foundation was officially launched on Jeff Astle Day at The Hawthorns. The FA's head of performance services Dave Reddin believes the panel will help take safety in the sport to the next level. Jeff Astle died in 2002 after suffering a number of heavy blows to his head during his footballing career. 'The role of the expert panel is to monitor and advise the FA and other football bodies on the appropriate guidelines for all levels of the game,' he told www.thefa.com. 'We have seen an improvement in guidance and communication in this area of sports medicine but we are conscious there is potentially much more to do. 'The group will also be asked to help advise on how football's world governing body should examine and research any long-term effects on the brain through head injury or repeated concussion episodes. George North has been under the spotlight in recent months after suffering a number of concussions. 'I genuinely believe we now have the right people on board to be able to provide the right level of insight for such an important issue.' Reddin, the FA's head of medical services Dr Ian Beasley and representatives of the Premier League, Football League and Professional Footballers' Association will all observe the panel.

Article: This is the incredible moment a tiger was sent crashing to the floor after mistiming an attack on a fleet-footed bird. The ferocious feline was chasing what was sure to be dinner when it slipped on the icy surface and lost its footing. As the tiger raced towards the bird, it flew directly upwards forcing the mammal to try and stop dead in its tracks. Oops-a-daisy! This tiger lots its footing in spectacular style while trying to catch a chicken at a zoo in China. On the attack: At first all was well, with the tiger homing straight in on an airborne feathery meal. Target: As the bird flew upwards the tiger began to rear up, ready to grab its prey from the air. Fail: The tiger began to slip as the bird flew higher and higher in a blind panic - and it was all caught on camera by photographer Libby Zhang. Hang time: The slip caused the tiger to flip right onto its back, with the bird now well out of reach. But momentum caused its feet to slide away from underneath and go skidding along the slippery ground. The hilarious moment took place at the Hengdaohezi Siberian Tiger Park in Northeast China and was captured by photographer Libby Zhang. Libby, from Houston in Texas, was visiting the park and photographing the tigers' feeding session. Love your tiger feet: The hilarious moment took place at the Hengdaohezi Siberian Tiger Park in Northeast China. Roaringly funny: The photographer said that a watching crowd burst out laughing when the tiger fell over. She said: 'The crowd burst out in a roar of laughter - it was during feeding time and several chickens were tossed at the tigers. 'One tiger tried to reach it but he lost his balance on the slippery icy and fell backwards. 'I was surprised to see the tiger slip and raised my camera in a hurry with rapid fires on the trigger. 'I wanted to capture the beauty and power of tigers in the same image, but this tiger slip series was a total surprise and added bonus for my trip.'

Article: (CNN)Kayahan, one of Turkey's best-loved singers and songwriters, died of cancer Friday at the age of 66. He had performed most recently in Istanbul on Valentine's Day. The performer, who was also an accomplished guitarist, was first diagnosed with cancer in 1990, the year he competed in the Eurovision Song Contest, and the year before he released the album that ignited his career. The cancer returned in 2005 and then again in 2014, Turkey's semiofficial Anadolu Agency reported. He died Friday in a hospital in Istanbul, five days after his 66th birthday. "We are in grief over losing Kayahan, who contributed to Turkish music with countless compositions and marked a generation with his songs," Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu tweeted. The singer, whose full name was Kayahan Acar, was born in Izmir province, in western Turkey on March 29, 1949. He grew up in Ankara, Turkey's capital, before moving to Istanbul. In 1990, he competed in the Eurovision Song Contest, finishing 17th. The following year he released an album titled "I Made a Vow," which catapulted him to prominence. Though he recorded nearly 20 albums, that one would remain his most popular. His final album was released in 2007. Other artists recorded his material throughout his career. Videos available online show a vibrant performer with a thick shock of dark hair as he accompanies himself on guitar and croons in a clear tenor. Kayahan was best known for his love songs. More recent videos show a  frailer performer, seated and without a guitar, but still clearly glorying in the joy of singing a song.

Article: Oxford women made history on Saturday with a 12th boat race victory in 16 years on a landmark day for the sport. For the first time in 88 years the women’s race was staged on the famous Tideway course that for so long had been the sole preserve of the men. Hot favourites Oxford romped to victory by six and a half lengths against Cambridge, as the women struck a telling blow for sporting equality in racing the same championship course on the same day as the men. Ansastaia Chitty lifts the trophy aloft after Oxford won the boat race, easing past Cambridge on the Thames. On the day the Oxford sides shared the race route for the first time, they also shared the exact same winning margin, with the men going on to triumph in their race shortly afterwards. Oxford women’s president Anastasia Chitty hailed the victory as a special moment for her crew, but also for rowing and sporting equality overall. ‘It’s an amazing moment,’ Chitty told BBC Sport. ‘To pull something off like that is amazing. ‘To row on the same stage as the men, there were so many women before us who have never had this opportunity and it’s extremely humbling. We started moving away early on and kept ourselves ahead.’ The Oxford crew celebrate their win over Cambridge after dominating the race from start to finish. As the most decorated Olympic athlete ever to race in either boat race, Oxford stroke Caryn Davies underlined the quality on display in the women’s contest. The 32-year-old US Olympics team star boasts silver at Athens and gold medals at Beijing and London in the women’s eight — and now a boat race victory to boot. ‘I think that’s harder, I’ve got to be honest,’ Davies told BBC Sport when asked how the boat race compared to Olympic competition. The Oxford women's crew power to their win in the first women's boat race on the river Thames. ‘There was almost three times as long to suffer. But there’s always less suffering when you win! I’m just proud and honoured to have such attention. It shows how excited people are and I’m so glad we can be role models to young women everywhere.’ Oxford women finished in 19 minutes 45 seconds — 19 seconds ahead of Cambridge. Davies added: ‘I could just hear so many people cheering along the banks and it didn’t matter it they were cheering for Oxford or Cambridge. Just that they turned out was really great for us.’ After Oxford’s women breezed to victory, their male counterparts made it a Dark Blue double with victory in the 161st men’s race by an identical six and a half lengths. President Constantine Louloudis claimed a fourth and final boat race victory, completing a clean sweep only interrupted by claiming bronze with Team GB’s men’s eight at London 2012. The dark blues made a fast start and dominated the race against their Cambridge counterparts. Louloudis hailed the victory — Oxford’s 11th in the last 15 years — and admitted he felt far more pressure than before, despite his three previous wins. ‘I felt much more pressure this year, especially as I was leaving the guys,’ Louloudis told BBC Sport. ‘There were some pretty dark moments going in but I’m so pleased for the guys. We just stuck to our plan and executed a great race. ‘This was a fantastic performance. It is a relief to win as we were firm favourites. ‘Rio remains the long-term goal but this race was so important for me and all of us.’ They were true to form, surging ahead from the start. Despite being quickly pegged back, they powered ahead during the middle section to dominate the race, finishing in 17 minutes 34 seconds — winning by 19 seconds as Oxford’s women had before them. Crew member Michael DiSanto added: ‘We knew what we needed to do and we wanted to go down as one of the best Oxford crews ever.’ Louloudis lauded the achievements of the women’s boat on such a landmark occasion. ‘This was an historic day and there is no reason not to be optimistic for the sport going forward,’ he said. The Cambridge crew kept going to the end but they were outclassed, eventually losing by over six lengths.

Oxford won their 12th women's boat race in 16 years. The Dark Blues triumphed by six and a half lengths. It was the first time the women's race has been raced over the same course and on the same day as the men's event.

Article: Everton midfielder James McCarthy believes Ross Barkley is more than capable of handling the highs and lows which accompany the tremendous expectation which rests on his shoulders. The 1-0 victory over Southampton, courtesy of captain Phil Jagielka's fifth goal of the season, was a case in point. In the first half he produced a brilliant piece of control and skill to skip past three opponents and launch an attack from deep inside his own half which brought Goodison Park to its feet. Everton midfielder James McCarthy believes Ross Barkley is capable of handling the pressure on him. McCarthy (left) said he thought Barkley was 'different class' despite a mistake with an ambitious pass. However, when his ambitious pass after the break gifted possession to the visitors the all-too familiar sound of loud groans echoed around the ground. Then, to cap it all, manager Roberto Martinez's decision to replace him with 20 minutes to go - a requirement to help shore up a tight game - was greeted with disagreement and boos. It is difficult to know what Barkley, who was lauded for two substitute appearances for England in the last 10 days, thought of it, but McCarthy is confident the youngster can deal with the complexities and confusion which appear to surround most of his performances. 'I think Ross was different class,' he said. 'I thought he worked really hard for the team and was a real nuisance driving at people and it was brilliant to see him high in confidence having been away with England. Barkley was withdrawn with 20 minutes to go at Goodison Park, a decision that brought boos from the crowd. 'Ross is a good lad and has his feet firmly on the ground and has a lot of people at the club looking after him. 'He won't get carried away. We have a lot of characters, a lot of experienced heads in the dressing room and there is no better place to be for him.' Aside from Jagielka's 16th-minute goal, giving the centre-back his best tally in eight years at the club, the only other notable action saw goalkeeper Tim Howard claw away Graziano Pelle's early shot from under his crossbar and throw out a hand, while diving the wrong way, to stop James Ward-Prowse's strike. Everton achieved what they were unable to do earlier in the season and ground out victory to make it three successive wins, moving them to 11th in the table, with the relegation fears of a couple of weeks ago now a thing of the past. With nothing to play for in their remaining seven matches McCarthy believes the motivation is to remain unbeaten until the end of the campaign. McCarthy is confident youngster Barkley can deal with the complexities of his sometimes indifferent form. 'We want to kick on, go on a winning run and finish the season strongly,' he added. 'We have won three games and we want to go unbeaten until the end of the season, although that is easier said than done. 'There has been a big improvement. So far, so good, but we won't get carried away. 'The most important thing was to get three points and dig in deep to secure it with a clean sheet.' With leading scorer Romelu Lukaku not quite ready to return after a hamstring injury, the onus was on other players to step up, but few would have bet on Jagielka being the match winner against Saints. Everton secured a 1-0 victory over Southampton, courtesy of captain Phil Jagielka's fifth goal of the season. 'He is different class. He is brilliant to have at the club and is a true leader on the pitch,' said McCarthy. 'A lot of people have been saying the last few weeks he has been exceptional, but for me he has been outstanding throughout the campaign and he is chipping in with goals.' Southampton boss Ronald Koeman conceded his side's Champions League hopes were now over, but was still keen to secure European football next season. Southampton boss Ronald Koeman conceded his side's Champions League hopes were now over. 'European football for the club will be a great success if we reach it,' he said. 'If we showed the ambition we showed (against Everton) then we will have a good chance.' Italy international Pelle has not scored in nine matches for his club - he did manage one against England in midweek - but Koeman still backs him. 'Pelle is struggling but that is football, it is normal. If I don't have confidence I don't pick him in the line-up,' he added.

Article: Daniel Ricciardo has called for a back-to-basics approach for Red Bull to forge a return to the front of the grid. Second best to Mercedes last season after a run of four successive championship triumphs, Red Bull have struggled at the start of this year. To rub salt into the wounds, Red Bull even found themselves trailing'sister' team Toro Rosso at the last race in Malaysia. Daniel Ricciardo in action during practice for this weekend's Chinese Grand Prix. The Australian driver has urged his Red Bull team to go back to basics after a troubled start to 2015. The main gripe has centred on power-unit supplier Renault, with billionaire benefactor Dietrich Mateschitz suggesting this week he could pull his team out of the sport if matters fail to improve. Ahead of this weekend's grand prix in China, Ricciardo concedes Red Bull are exploring numerous avenues to correct the problems. The Australian managed to finish third quickest in practice, a second behind reigning champion Lewis Hamilton in his Mercedes and four tenths of a second adrift of Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen. 1. Lewis Hamilton Mercedes 1:37.219. 2. Kimi Raikkonen Ferrari 1:37.662. 3. Daniel Ricciardo Red Bull - Renault 1:38.311. 4. Sebastian Vettel Ferrari 1:38.339. 5. Nico Rosberg Mercedes 1:38.399. 6.

Sergio Perez Force India - Mercedes 1:40.868. 19. Roberto Merhi  Marussia - Ferrari 1:42.973. 20. Will Stevens  Marussia - Ferrari 1:44.564. 'We are experimenting with a few things, but I think for now we have to go back to what we know, get our basics right,' said Ricciardo. 'We have done quite a bit. In Malaysia we had brake issues, a lot of overheating, so we have reverted back on a few things, even from last year which we knew was more efficient. 'Just because it's from last year it doesn't mean it's not better, so I guess we have taken a step back in that direction. The team has done quite a lot to rectify some issues and get us further up the grid.' Ricciardo has no doubt Renault are also pulling their weight, adding: 'From Melbourne to Malaysia they made a pretty massive step with driveability. 'We also have a few more software things this weekend, which should give things another pretty significant step on that side. 'I appreciate what everyone is doing to get us back towards the front, so fingers crossed it can be put together in the right way this weekend and if so we can get back into that top five.' Daniil Kvyat was forced to pull off track 19 minutes from the end of FP2 after his brakes caught fire. Team-mate Daniil Kvyat, however, was not so fortunate as the young Russian was forced to pull off track 19 minutes from the end of FP2 after his brakes caught fire. Christian Horner said: 'Something overheated within the rear hub assembly. As a result of that we lost pressure in the master cylinder halfway round the lap. 'We asked him to drive back slowly without using the brakes if at all possible, but unfortunately he had to brake at turn 14 and he had a very slow off. 'It's frustrating it's happened, but all the relevant pieces are intact so we can find out what the root cause was.' Despite suffering brake issues in Malaysia, Horner insists the issue there and the one experienced by Kvyat are 'totally unrelated'. Horner added: 'Today was a one-off and can be sorted for tomorrow.'

Article: Beijing (CNN)China's state prosecutors on Friday formally charged the country's former security czar with accepting bribes, making him the highest-ranking Chinese Communist Party official ever to face corruption charges. Zhou Yongkang, 72, was also charged with abuse of power and leaking state secrets, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the highest prosecution authority in China, said. As a member of the ruling Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee -- China's top decision-making body -- Zhou was one of nine men who effectively ruled the country of more than 1.3 billion people. He retired in 2012. At the height of his power, Zhou controlled police forces, spy agencies, court systems as well as prosecution offices across China -- and wasn't shy in deploying his vast assets to crush dissent and unrest in the name of "preserving social stability." Now, prosecutors have accused Zhou of "taking advantage of his posts to seek benefits for others and illegally accepting huge amounts of money" during his long political career. His alleged actions have caused heavy losses to public assets and greatly harmed national interests, they added. Zhou was notified of his legal rights during the investigation and his lawyer's views were heard, according to a statement by the prosecutors. His case will be tried in Tianjin, a city near the Chinese capital, Beijing. The president of China's supreme court recently told reporters there would be "open" trials for accused former leaders like Zhou. However, the charge of leaking state secrets may allow authorities to shield certain legal proceedings from public view in Zhou's case. Zhou has not been seen in public since he attended an anniversary event at his alma mater in October 2013. He was expelled from the Communist Party and arrested last December. State media have painted an intricate web of officials, cronies and tycoons -- some with alleged mafia connections -- orbiting around Zhou before the crumbling of his power structure last summer. Zhou and his family members were said to have accumulated enormous wealth, in a blatant exchange between money and power. He was also found to have affairs with multiple women and allegedly traded power for sex, state-run Xinhua news agency reported last year. Analysts have viewed his shocking downfall as a watershed moment in the secretive world of Chinese politics, now ruled by President Xi Jinping. Xi has been spearheading a massive anti-corruption campaign,  targeting both "tigers" and "flies" --  high-ranking, and low-level, officials. Zhou is by far the biggest tiger caught in Xi's dragnet to date. "The important thing here is that Xi has proven he's powerful enough to break this taboo of never incriminating former Politburo Standing Committee members," longtime political analyst Willy Lam, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said last year, when the government revealed its formal investigation into Zhou. Many observers also note Zhou's patronage of Bo Xilai, a former Communist leader sentenced to life in prison for corruption in 2013. Bo's spectacular downfall the year before -- complete with tales of murder, bribery and betrayal -- attracted global attention. State media have cited his subsequent conviction as a prime example of Xi's resolve to clean up the party. The former Chongqing Communist Party chief's supporters, however, have long called him a political victim --  the former high-flying politician was once considered Xi's main challenger for the top spot of Chinese leadership. Political watchers see similarities between the Bo and Zhou cases. "The people being investigated for corruption are on the losing side of factional struggles," said Lam, who has predicted a suspended death sentence for Zhou.

Article: It's being billed as the Euro-derby in Madrid and depending on who you support the precedent is either last season's Champions League final or the six games that have been played between Real and Atletico since then. In Monday's pre-match press conference almost every question asked to Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti made reference to the fact that in six Madrid derbies this season Real are yet to win a single game – losing four and drawing two as Atletico have beaten them twice in the league and in the Spanish Super Cup and the Copa del Rey. But a remarkably relaxed Ancelotti, showing the kind of form in press room that he will hope his players show on the pitch Tuesday, reminded everyone that his team did not need to win. Two draws could see them go through so what was the problem? He said he didn't see Barcelona's slip on Saturday night against Sevilla because he was at the cinema 'enjoying a film' and when he was asked about Atletico Madrid's threat from set-pieces he responded: 'Don't forget we won the Champions League with a set-piece last season.' Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti says he is not obsessed with Atletico Madrid ahead of Tuesday's clash. Madrid-based papers Marca (left) and AS are looking ahead to the Champions League quarter-final first leg. Sergio Ramos (centre) scored an injury-time equaliser for Real as they beat Atletico 4-1 aet in the Champions League final last season at Benfica's Stadium of Light in Lisbon. However, Atletico are unbeaten in six Madrid derbies this term and dumped Real out of the Copa del Rey. His reference to Sergio Ramos' injury-time goal against Atletico Madrid in Lisbon that levelled Diego Godin's header and allowed Real to run in riot in extra-time will have struck a chord with Real supporters who in the build-up to the game have been busy reminding their rivals that while they may have won none of the last six meetings they did come out on top in the match that mattered more than any other. Real Madrid are at full strength for the game and that seems to have left Ancelotti as upbeat and confident as at any time so far this season. He toyed with his Spanish inquisitors when they questioned him about whether or not Gareth Bale would start the game. The Welshman was rested at the weekend but will be in the XI on Tuesday night. 'If Bale is not 100 percent fit he will not play because we have everyone available' said Ancelotti leaving a pregnant pause. But as the possibility that Spanish favourite Isco might start the game presented itself the Italian coach added: 'But he is 100 percent.' He added: 'Bale was fantastic last season but had been really good this season. He came good in the big finals scoring in the Champions League and Copa del Rey finals so let's see how he performs now in the final months of the season.' Gareth Bale (centre) is set to start for Real after being rested at the weekend against Eibar on Saturday. Like Ramos, Bale was also on target during Real's Champions League final success over Atletico last season. The feeling among Real Madrid's coaching staff is that while Bale has been criticised by the Madrid press for not being the team player that Isco is, his ability to win a big final with a goal or an assist is unmatchable. Anelotti added: 'I am not obsessed with Atletico Madrid,' mentioning 'attitude' several times in his positive discourse and admitting that was the key missing ingredient from Real Madrid's 4-0 defeat to Atletico in February. He said facing Simeone was 'honour and a problem' and picked out Atletico Madrid's resilience when asked what their greatest quality was. 'They fight from the first minute to the last,' he said. Atletico Madrid fans believe that fight will see them overcome Real Madrid for the seventh time this season and the Vicente Calderon will be full for what, with their title hopes now gone, is their game of the season. Real's swagger has been rediscovered though, wth the return of key players Sergio Ramos, James Rodriguez and Luka Modric. Ancelotti recalled the moment Modric' corner was headed in by Ramos in Lisbon. 'It's a wonderful memory,' he said. 'Now we have the challenge of going for Real Madrid's 11th European Cup. Real know they face a stern test against an Atletico side that beat them 4-0 when they last met in February. Ancelotti hails pitting his wits against Atletico boss Diego Simeone as an 'honour and a problem' The return of midfielder Luka Modric (centre) from injury has revitalised Real in recent weeks.

Article: Vincent Kompany has emerged as an injury doubt for the Manchester derby. City boss Manuel Pellegrini revealed that the Belgium centre-half will be assessed on Saturday, 24 hours ahead of Sunday's clash at Old Trafford. The Chilean, whose side have slipped into fourth place, also reinstated that he has no fears over his job amid mounting pressure. Aleksandar Kolarov (11), Frank Lampard (18) and Edin Dzeko (10) lead the way in Manchester City training. Yaya Toure attempts to control the ball during training at the City football academy. Sergio Aguero leaps up in the air in front of Bacary Sagna to win a header during training. However, he did admit: 'We will see what happens in August.' City captain Kompany, 29 on Friday, would be a huge loss despite his patchy form this season. He played 90 minutes in Monday's 2-1 loss against Crystal Palace but picked up a hamstring injury at Selhurst Park and Pellegrini said he is doubtful for the match against Louis van Gaal's men. 'Kompany we will assess tomorrow,' he said. 'He worked the whole week the normal way. I always say the same. We are always better with Kompany but if he cannot play we have a squad.' If Kompany is deemed unfit City could be facing a defensive crisis with Dedryck Boyata also injured. That would leave Pellegrini with a pairing of the ageing Martin Demichelis and the inconsistent Eliaquim Mangala. Vincent Kompany is an injury doubt for Manchester City's clash against Manchester United on Sunday. City captain and central defender Kompany played 90 minutes as City lost 2-1 to Crystal Palace on Monday. City manager Manuel Pellegrini insists he does not fear for his job, despite his team dropping into fourth. City are in fourth place, a point behind United, after losing three of their last five Premier League matches and taking 18 points from 36 since the turn of the year. Some have speculated that Pellegrini could face the sack at the end of the season. When asked if he was worried about his future he said: 'I don't think so. I am not talking about my future because it's not important. I'm just thinking about the game against Manchester United.' However, he added: 'You never know what will happen in August. if you ask me I am not afraid because I think we are in a bad moment. 'We are not a disaster, we are not a mess. We are doing a lot of things well.' City, who will also be without strike pair Stevan Jovetic (muscle injury) and Wilfried Bony (ankle and knee), will be going for five straight derby wins for the first time in their history against third-placed United who are a point in front. But Pellegrini refused to say that they were now the biggest club in Manchester. Eliaquim Mangala (left) could be set to replace Kompany in the team to take on United on Sunday. Strikers Stevan Jovetic (left) and Wilfried Bony are already out of the Manchester derby through injury. 'I don't like to compare,' he said. 'Our target is not to compare but to improve in our project. Pellegrini added that his men were still using a certain ex-United manager as motivation. 'United dominated the league for so many years, but one time Sir Alex Ferguson said the neighbours are disturbing them a little bit more, so I say that's double motivation for us,' he said.

Article: A benefits cheat who claimed he could barely walk while starring for his pub football team has avoided jail. Raymond Billam illegally pocketed £15,000 of taxpayers' money after he said he was severely disabled due to back and knee problems. But fraud investigators secretly filmed the 40-year-old midfielder taking to the pitch for a Sunday League team after being tipped-off about his fraudulent claims. The grandfather-of-four admitted benefit fraud and was sentenced to 26-weeks in prison suspended for two years. Cheat: Raymond Billam, 40, claimed he was unable to walk more than a few metres, but was filmed running and jumping as he took to the pitch for his pub football team. Shaven headed Billam claimed he was unable to walk more than 20 metres without falling and needed crutches to get around. But between September 2008 and April 2014 he pulled on the green and black shirt of Ingsfield Lane football club and two other teams in the Mexborough and District Sunday League. In total Billam of Bolton-on-Dearne, South Yorkshire, played over 87 games while dishonestly claiming incapacity benefit, Barnsley Magistrates Court was told. Julie Grant, prosecuting, said: 'Over three consecutive Sundays he was playing football, running, jumping and participating fully showing no signs of discomfort.' His appearances and goals were even posted on the internet, magistrates' heard. 'Clearly this is not consistent with somebody unable to walk without aids,' the prosecutor added. When Billam was arrested he said he had 'good days and bad days' and he was so well-known in the league that others could have been playing under his name. But he could not provide investigators with a list of names. Billam admitted defrauding the Department of Work and Pensions by pocketing £15,066 through dishonestly failing to notify a change in circumstances which affected his disability living allowance. Chris Peace, defending, said Billam, who has four grandchildren, had worked as a contractor for Yorkshire Water for 16 years until he suffered a serious back injury in 2006 which needed surgery. He initially  made a legitimate claim and went from 13 to 18 and a half stones and had problems with drinking and gambling. 'He was in a bit of a state,' said Mr Peace. The court heard that playing football helped Billam recover from the the low point in his life. Billam had claimed more than £15,000 in incapacity benefit when the Department of Work and Pensions were tipped off. Unknown to the grandfather-of-four he was secretly filmed by fraud investigators donning his green and black shirt. Billam was sentenced to a 26-week suspended prison sentence after he admitted benefit fraud. Billam, who was taking jobs as a self employed plumber by October 2013, accepted that he should have notified the Department of Work and Pensions earlier that he was fit to work. 'The allowance was a regular source of income and he had three children at home and it was very difficult to do without that,' his lawyer said. 'It was difficult to wave goodbye to that when you have lots of bills.' The court heard Billam was repaying the money and the whole amount outstanding would be paid off. Billam was given a 26-week jail term suspended for two years, ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work and he will be subject to an electronically monitored daily curfew for four months. A spokesman for the Department of Work and Pensions said: 'Billam was very brazen about what he was doing. 'It's hard to believe someone can think they are entitled to incapacity benefits because they claim they can't walk far without assistance. 'Yet we observed him on three consecutive Sundays, running around, jumping and heading the ball and putting in some strong tackles.'

Article: (CNN)"Sell all that you own and distribute the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me," Jesus tells the rich man in one of his best-known parables. It was a mantra he invoked repeatedly: the poor were blessed, and it was easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than it was for the well-to-do to enter paradise.  Meanwhile, Jesus told his Twelve Apostles to leave their day jobs and follow him on an itinerant mission with few prospects of success and no visible means of support. So how did this wandering band of  first-century evangelists support themselves? Clearly, money was a concern, and not just as an impediment to salvation. In the New Testament, money gets 37 mentions, while "gold" gets 38 citations, "silver" merits 20, and "copper" four. "Coin" comes up eight times, and "purse" and "denarii" -- the Roman currency -- get half a dozen mentions each for a total of 119 currency referrals. Perhaps the most relevant reference is also one of the most charged passages in the New Testament:. As the Gospel of John tells it, six days before Passover, Jesus was in Bethany at the house of his friend Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. A woman named Mary takes a jar of costly perfumed oil and anoints the feet of the reclining Jesus. She dries his feet with her hair, an irresistible image for artists and dramatists. Judas Iscariot objected to the act. "Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor?" Judas asks. Though 300 denarii was the annual wage of a laborer, Jesus told Judas to leave her alone, and foreshadowing his fate, said the anointing would be useful for his burial, and besides, "you always have the poor with you" -- but Jesus would not always be there. What that passage makes clear is that the Jesus community had a common purse because they needed money to survive. So how much? "I imagine the ministry functioned at a subsistence level," Rabbi Joshua Garroway, a professor of Early Christianity and the Second Commonwealth at Hebrew Union College in Los Angeles. Jesus and his disciples walked, wore what they had, slept outside or in stayed in friends' homes. They ate what they caught or what others shared. "I venture to guess that begging and hospitality will have sufficed to meet the basic needs of Jesus and the companions with whom he traveled," Garroway said. Garroway said that it was possible, even likely, that Jesus and his followers received donations from supporters, and possibly substantial ones from some of the rich people who were drawn to his ministry despite -- or perhaps because of -- his preaching on the perils of wealth. The Gospel of Luke gives us a glimpse of how Jesus' ministry functioned on a practical level:. "Soon afterwards he went on through cities and villages, proclaiming and bringing the good news of the kingdom of God. The twelve were with him, as well as some women who had been cured of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary, called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out,  and Joanna, the wife of Herod's steward Chuza, and Susanna, and many others, who provided for them  out of their resources." So, according to Luke, women whom Jesus had healed in turn provided for him out of their "resources," with Mary Magdalene and Joanna capturing our attention -- one by virtue of her husband, and the other, by her stature in the story of Jesus. Joanna was an upper-class woman married to a man who was intelligent and capable enough to manage the complicated household of Herod Antipas, the son of Herod the Great, the violent and ambitious head of Judea. As part of this volatile but powerful household, Joanna would be uniquely positioned to help Jesus with her resources, being both wealthy and having palace connections. She attends to him during his life, and, the Gospels tell us, after his death, as one of the trio of women who go to his tomb and find it empty. With her on that morning is Mary Magdalene, also identified as -- among other things -- a financial supporter of Jesus. Mary likely came from the prosperous town of Magdala, on the Sea of Galilee. As home to a thriving fishing industry, as well as dye and textile works, Mary could well have come from an affluent family -- or have been a successful business woman herself. Mary Magdalene was free to travel the country with Jesus and his disciples, so was unlikely to have a husband and children waiting for her at home, and in "Finding Jesus" we examine the Gnostic gospel of Mary Magdalene and explore the argument that Jesus was, in fact, her husband. She may have simply been an independent woman with her own resources who found a compelling message, and messenger. Not only was Mary Magdalene one of Jesus' most devoted followers, who stuck with him all the way from Galilee to Jerusalem, from the ministry to the cross and the tomb, but also she provided for him from her own means, said Mark Goodacre, a professor of New Testament and Christian Origins at Duke University. When the Gospels speak of her "ministering" to Jesus, they are explaining that she was one of the key figures in Jesus' everyday mission, Goodacre continues. Along with other women like Joanna and Susanna, she was one of those who made his mission viable. Along with these women, men like Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus, both men of stature and wealth, may have chipped in to help fund Jesus' ministry. The Gospels reveal that both these men were rich, and supported Jesus -- indeed, it was Joseph who removed Jesus from the cross on Good Friday, anointing his body with the help of Nicodemus, and placing him in the tomb that Joseph had reserved for himself. After the resurrection on that first Easter Sunday, the movement Jesus started grew exponentially, and the church's relationship to money grew more complicated as the needs became greater. Michael McKinley is co-author, with David Gibson, of "Finding Jesus: Faith. Fact. Forgery.: Six Holy Objects That Tell the Remarkable Story of the Gospels."

Article: Andy Lee will leave New York with his head held high and a burgeoning reputation firmly intact. A dramatic, frenetic 12 rounds here saw the Irishman sent sprawling in the very first against the dangerous Peter Quillin, the man who vacated the WBO middleweight title Lee won so gloriously in Las Vegas last December before the result was deemed a draw. It was the first time the reigning champion had gone the distance. No mean feat considering he fought for a lengthy period with a strained biceps muscle in his left arm. Peter Quillin (left) and Andy Lee stand with the referee after the judges declared their bout a draw. The two fighters embrace following their exciting 12-round contest in Brooklyn on Saturday night. Lee retains his WBO belt after Quillin failed to make the required 160lbs weight on Friday. Quillin's unbeaten record remains intact following the tie though he threw fewer punches than Lee. The two fighters congratulate each other at the end of the 12 rounds, which were judged to be a draw. With Quillin dramatically failing to make the required weight of 160lbs on Friday, Lee strode out in front of a healthy crowd knowing whatever happens, his belt wasn't going anywhere. Yet this was still one hell of a contest and when the judges correctly called it a tie, no-one was really arguing. While it was scored 113-112, 112-113, 113-113, the statistics told a different story. Lee threw more punches (299-267) and connected with greater frequency (113-103). It was a warrior-like display. Not maybe enough to have destroyed Quillin's unbeaten record, but impressively solid and energetic. Lee, however, was hard on himself. 'It was a tough fight, he dropped me at the start because I was lazy,'he said. 'I had the momentum late on. I understand with two knockdowns people may have thought he won but I could have done better.' Billy Joe Saunders is the mandatory challenger and looks the likeliest next opponent. Another meeting with Quillin, although intriguing with the title on the line, is highly unlikely. Lee was knocked to the canvas by Quillin during the very first round of the contest in New York. Lee admitted he had been 'lazy' in the early stages of the fight, leading to his knockdown and standing count. Quillin is ordered to the corner after Lee falls later in the bout. 'If my next fight is Quillin it should be in Ireland. He has an Irish surname. Maybe he has some ancestors there,' smiled Lee, who will now look forward to a few weeks off to recharge the batteries before making his next move. Only the American will know how, even though he last fought a year ago, his team somehow allowed their man to miss the weight so spectacularly. The 31-year-old was over by almost a pound-and-a-half. Trainer Adam Booth thought he looked over the limit in the build-up. Lee would never display such a lack of professionalism. The 30-year-old in the form and shape of his life. Title fight or not, this was the Irishman's chance to show he belongs at boxing's top table. A polished display was the order of the evening to ensure his rapier-like trajectory continues this year. Quillin insisted before the clash it would be like a chess match. He was right, yet playing with Kings or Queens don't often lead to the explosion of power which sent Lee spiralling to the canvas at the end of the first round. Quillin's right connects with Lee's right shoulder during the Middleweight bout. Lee and Quillin exchange punches at close quarters during the tight contest. Lee is put onto the pack foot as Quillin lines up a punch with his right. Quillin's right hook rocked the Irishman who was given a standing count. It was just the second time he'd hit the floor, taking in both his amateur and professional career. No wonder Lee looked dazed. The American was quickly showing why he's the proud owner of an unblemished record. A razor-sharp combination had Lee reeling again but the Limerick man is a true warrior. A far better third saw Quillin on the backfoot for the first time as, after such a frenetic start, everything began to calm somewhat. Lee went down again and although it was originally scored as a knockdown it later emerged Quillin had stepped on his foot. If the scorecard had taken that into account, a draw could well have turned into an Irish win. Nevertheless, Lee needed some respite. The Brooklyn crowd unleashed some booing to display their displeasure at both fighters standing their ground. Yet the Irishman, who won his last two fights by coming from behind to land the killer blow, wouldn't have care a jot. Heading into the sixth, Quillin was ahead in the eyes of the judges. Lee, the master of coming from behind to snatch victory, needed something special. Quillin connects with Lee's cheek with a crunching right. Quillin again makes contact but over the course of the whole fight, he landed fewer punches. The comeback came at the end of the seventh, a crunching right leaving a very open Quillin tumbling. It was the first time he'd been down in his career. Lee, though, needed more heading into the tenth. The final rounds were dramatic without ever really looking terminal for either fighter. And when the last bell rang, Lee and the amiable Quillin hugged and showed a deep admiration towards each other which has been evident all week. 'The judges see it their way and I respect the decision,'said the American. 'There is a first time for everything, I got knocked down and thankfully I got up. There is no perfect story, I come from nothing so to have something is a blessing as is going home to a family I love. 'Respect to Andy Lee though.'

Judges scored the contest 113-112, 112-113, 113-113 - a tie. Irishman Lee was floored in the first round but fought back admirably. He threw more punches and connected more regularly than his opponent. Quillin had failed to make the required weight of 160lbs on Friday. Reigning WBO middleweight champion Lee went distance for first time. And he did most of it with a strained biceps muscle in his left arm.

Article: John Carver says he would walk away from Newcastle United if the club’s hierarchy had not given him assurances of serious summer investment. Supporters are threatening to boycott the next home match against Spurs in protest at Mike Ashley’s running of the club and a perceived lack of ambition. Newcastle have lost the last five Tyne-Wear derbies and, in the wake of Sunday’ s 1-0 defeat at Sunderland, the owner, head coach and players have come in for strong criticism. John Carver would walk away from Newcastle  if the club’s hierarchy had not given him reassurances. Fans are threatening to boycott the next home game in protest at Mike Ashley’s running of the club. But Carver said: ‘I can understand that their (fans) concern, but we’re already addressing it behind the scenes. ‘Mike and Lee Charnley (managing director) know what they have to do. And I’m telling you now, if I was sitting here and I thought they were giving me lip service I would say “thanks very much, I’m off - I’m walking away from this”. ‘If I didn’t have enough belief in what they were trying to do and the promises that they’ve said about the summer, then I would. But I’m not because I know what they’re saying to me is right. They’ve said that we need to bring players into this football club, first of all to boost the size of the squad, but also to improve the quality, to take us on. ‘We can’t stand still because other clubs are not standing still and they know that. We have to go with them. And if we don’t, you get left behind.' He added: ‘We’ve had different managers but the same group of players (keep getting beat in derbies). There is something in the DNA. Newcastle players train at the club's training complex on Thursday ahead of Monday's clash with Liverpool. Newcastle trio Moussa Sissoko, Vurnon Anita and Massaido Haidara take a breather during training. Ryan Taylor attemps to bend the ball around some dummies and hit the target during Thursday's session. ‘It’s something we need to look at. We struggle when we have to compete. We have talked about addressing that in the summer.’ Carver concedes that his side – on the back of four straight defeats – still need more than the 35 points they currently sit on to be assured of safety. They travel to Liverpool on Monday before entertaining Spurs a week on Sunday. And Carver has urged fans to get behind the team. ‘Supporters go to work, pay their money and they’re entitled to do whatever they want to,’ he said in response to news of a proposed boycott. ‘But we’re at the business end of the season now and I’m pleading, “get behind the team, give us your support, because it makes a difference”. ‘Especially the situation we’re in at the moment, we need as much help and support as we can get.’ Jermain Defoe (centre) connects beautifully with a left-footed volley to score the winner for Sunderland. Newcastle players look dejected following Sunday's 1-0 defeat to rivals Sunderland at the Stadium of Light.

Article: Jenson Button has been penalised for his crash with Pastor Maldonado during Sunday’s Chinese Grand Prix. The pair were dicing for 13th place when Button hit the back of Maldonado’s Lotus as they battled for position on the run down to Turn 1. Maldonado, who earlier in his incident-packed race missed the entry to the pit-lane, was sent into a spin, while Button sustained damage to his front wing. Jenson Button crashed into the back of Pastor Maldonado's Lotus on lap 49 of the Chinese Grand Prix. The incident unfolded in front of Fernando Alonso (right) who moved up two places. While Button limped to finish 13th, Maldonado retired following rear-end damage sustained in the crash. The incident on lap 49 was referred to the race stewards and Button was given a five-second penalty after the race, which dropped the British driver to 14th. He was also given two penalty points on his superlicence. ‘I thought there was room on the inside and, yeah, I can't really say anything else’, said a downbeat Button. ‘An incident you never want to happen, but just a misjudgement I guess.’ Jenson Button appeared in a relaxed mood before Sunday's race but had an afternoon to forget in China. Button, who finished 13th before he was demoted, is lapped by the Mercedes of Nico Rosberg. Button’s incident capped another disappointing weekend for McLaren with Button and team-mate Fernando Alonso scrapping for the menial places at the back of the field. Alonso, who finished 12th was lapped by both Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Raikkonen of Ferrari, the team he left at the end of last season.

However Julen Lopetegui has warned his side has plenty of room to improve saying the team 'hasn't stopped growing'. When Lopetegui comes up against his former Barcelona team-mate Pep Guardiola, who the former goalkeeper labels  'a winner', at Dragao on Wednesday night, it will be a clash of the two most prolific scoring sides of the tournament so far.

With a number of new players in the summer still meshing with the squad Porto have room for improvement. 'Many new players arrived last summer, but we have our idea of playing and the team has worked very well since the beginning of the season. 'We started this project with great enthusiasm and the purpose of qualifying the team for the Champions League [from the playoffs]. From there, the team hasn't stopped growing - travelling on its own path.'

Article: Edinson Cavani's agent has talked up a potential switch to Manchester United this summer after admitting a move to England is a possibility. United are monitoring the Uruguayan striker's situation at Paris Saint-Germain, and Cavani was furious about being taken off against Marseille at the weekend. And the 28-year-old's agent Claudio Anelucci says that a stint in the Premier League is most likely in the current climate, while a move to Spain would also suit his client.Ed. Edinson Cavani, pictured celebrating a goal against Chelsea, is a target for Manchester United this summer. Cavani protests with the referee during PSG's Ligue 1 fixture against Marseille at the weekend. He told Gazzetta dello Sport: 'Is Cavani on the market? At this point it's a little early to say. 'Edi is under contract at Paris Saint-Germain and there are several factors that come into play with respect to his future.' Once the situation is clarified there are several different scenarios given that players like him, at his level of maturity, are coveted by the biggest clubs in Europe. 'The market would seem to suggest Spain or England - we can't say at the present time that an Italian club could participate in the bidding for Cavani. United could make a move for PSG striker Edinson Cavani (right) when the transfer window reopens. 'However, we must remain alert to the developing situation at Milan and the recent change of ownership at Valencia.' Cavani is reportedly fed up of playing second fiddle to Zlatan Ibrahimovic in the French capital, often shunted out wide to get the best out of the Swedish striker. But PSG may want to keep hold of Cavani as they are unsure about Ibrahimovic's future at the club. United are thought to be interested in Cavani to replace Robin van Persie, with Juventus and Inter Milan eyeing the ageing forward.

Article: Niki Lauda’s red cap stood out like a beacon on the dull, grey tarmac of the biggest, most soulless paddock in all Formula One. The three-time world champion is colourful, candid and carefree. When your face is the charred remains of having nearly burned to death at the wheel of a Ferrari, why not throw caution to the wind or, in Shanghai’s case, the smog? Lauda, now chairman of Mercedes F1, aimed his first verbal grenade at his driver Nico Rosberg, who moments earlier had stood in front of him rotating his shoulders and about to play keepie-uppie to warm up for Friday's second practice session for the Chinese Grand Prix. Niki Lauda aimed a first verbal grenade at his driver Nico Rosberg ahead of the race in Shanghai. Mercedes AMG Petronas driver Rosberg is pushed back into his garage during the second practice session. Rosberg ended that session, as he did the first, behind Lewis Hamilton (below), his in-the-groove world champion team-mate who also markedly outperformed the German in the first two races, in Australia and Malaysia. Of course, not long after these words reach your breakfast tables in the shires, Rosberg may buck up and take pole, but it would be something of a surprise, not least to Lauda, if he did. ‘Yes, Nico is definitely a little bit behind Lewis,’ said the Austrian. ‘He has to sort himself out. It is not anything I can talk to him about. I don’t know why — he is not driving as well as he was. He will know what he has to do, and he must do it himself.’ Rosberg  looks on in the paddock after practice for the Chinese Formula One Grand Prix in Shanghai. Rosberg  drives during practice for the Formula One Grand Prix of China at Shanghai International Circuit. Rosberg is supremely professional. There is no lack of effort on his part. It is more that his confidence seems to have been shaken, whereas it was so strong in the early and mid parts of last season. Then Hamilton put down the hammer, changing the dynamic for both men. At least Rosberg is not the watching neutral’s only hope of a contest breaking out this season, after Ferrari shocked everyone by winning a fortnight ago. Nobody was ever more pleased to see Sebastian Vettel wagging his finger in celebration than fans whose own digits were poised over the television remotes’ off-switches, so jaundiced were they by the prospect of Mercedes’ seemingly endless hegemony. Mercedes AMG Petronas driver Rosberg chats with team members on the pit wall after the first practice.

Rosberg drives during practice for the Formula One Grand Prix of China at Shanghai International Circuit. As Bernie Ecclestone joked, Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff could have the legend, ‘The man who killed Formula One’, engraved on his tombstone. Lauda, a long-time friend of Ecclestone, has no time for sentiment. ‘Even if Ferrari winning makes Bernie happy, I will still be upset,’ he said. ‘The priority for me and Toto and Paddy (Lowe, the technical director) is to try to win every bloody race. It is our mission. Sebastian Vettel  looks on from the team garage during practice for the China Formula One Grand Prix. Vettel  drives during practice for the Formula One Grand Prix of China at Shanghai International Circuit. ‘I don’t care about the politics or what is good for Vettel or Ferrari. It is not my responsibility to make the sport more interesting. My worry for us is that Ferrari won so early in the season. ‘That gives them a lot of momentum. For an Italian team, momentum can be very important. ‘The Italians are emotional and it works best for them when they have a blend of English, Germans and Italians. They have that now (James Allison, a British engineer is their technical director). Vettel is a four-time world champion and so is someone to look up to. They have a combination of everything.’ Most observers thought Ferrari’s win in Malaysia might be a one-off created by the absurdly hot weather. But the evidence from practice is that the Scuderia may also be contenders in the considerably cooler Shanghai climate. Even though they appear not to be as quick over one lap, they look strong, possibly stronger than Mercedes, on a long run. Ferrari's German driver Vettel is pushed back to his garage after stopping at the pit lane exit in Shanghai. Vettel drives during practice for the Formula One Grand Prix of China at Shanghai International Circuit. ‘Qualifying doesn’t really worry us,’ said Lauda. ‘But they will be close on race pace. ‘They have made a big step up with their engine from last year to this, and I believe their horsepower is the same as ours.’ That was a big, honest and uplifting claim three races into a season that was being written off as a processional yawn.

Article: (CNN)When I was elected to the Kentucky State Senate in 1967, I became the first woman and the first person of color to serve in the body.  Five decades later, I find it almost unfathomable that a politician from my own state is attempting to launch his presidential campaign on a record that includes questioning landmark voting rights and civil rights legislation. But that is what Rand Paul, who today declared he's running for president of the United States, is doing. His campaign team told reporters last week that his campaign announcement message would be about "expanding the Republican Party" -- a message of inclusion. But those of us listening today who he is hoping to include, heard nothing more than hype. I'm not buying it. Since coming to the U.S. Senate, Paul has tried to sell himself as a different type of Republican.  He's tried to brand himself as the GOP's minority outreach candidate.  The problem for Paul, and the GOP at large, is that they don't back up their words with their policies. Yes, it's about time that Republicans started seriously considering the fact that black voters are an important piece of the electoral puzzle.  But they can't actually appeal to the community unless they have a real commitment to the issues facing minority communities.  A quick survey of Sen. Paul's positions makes clear that he does not. Paul kicked off his announcement speech in Louisville by declaring "I have a message that is loud and clear:  We have come to take our country back."  I have no doubt that under Paul's leadership, he would indeed take our country back -- in the wrong direction -- way back to a time when we were debating the Civil Rights Act --  which Paul has done since landing on the national stage; when there was no Department of Education -- a department he thinks "should be done away with;" when women didn't have choices -- choices Paul seeks to limit in Washington; when DREAMers weren't protected from deportation -- protections Paul currently opposes. In his inept speaking engagements at historically black colleges and universities, he has come across as condescending and lacking basic cultural competency. But Paul has also questioned the Civil Rights Act, and even claimed that private business owners have a right to discriminate. When asked about the need for a more robust Voting Rights Act following the Supreme Court's dismantling of the law, Paul dismissively remarked, "We have an African-American President." When President Obama stood with John Lewis and other veterans of the civil rights movement in front of the Edmund Pettus Bridge last month to mark the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, he inspired us all by saying: "With effort, we can roll back poverty and the roadblocks to opportunity.... With effort, we can protect the foundation stone of our democracy for which so many marched across this bridge -- and that is the right to vote." America is better -- and we solve more problems -- with more democracy, not less.  Unfortunately Rand Paul has demonstrated that he disagree with that basic principle.  Paul tried once again from that stage in Louisville to fashion himself as the one member of his party courageous enough to try to broaden Republican appeal to constituencies they ignore year after year. But his record makes it very clear that his views are outdated, outside of the mainstream, and disqualifying for a man who wants to lead our country. The American people deserve a leader who won't disrespect their intelligence, who won't pander to them when it's convenient, and who won't work to dismantle the progress we have made over the last five decades. What I heard today, didn't change the facts about Rand Paul's record.  The American people deserve better than Rand Paul.

Article: England picked up their first title on the Sevens World Series this season after beating competition leaders South Africa 21-14 in the final of the Tokyo tournament on Sunday. Phil Burgess, Charlie Hayter and Tom Mitchell scored the tries in the final for the English, who bounced back from a thumping group stage defeat to Fiji on Saturday to win a first title since the Wellington Sevens in Feb. 2013. 'I am unbelievably proud of this team. It's a huge effort and we are so grateful to deliver this title,' skipper Mitchell said after victory at a wet Prince Chichibu Memorial Rugby Ground. England's  James Rodwell (left) celebrates with his team-mates following their final victory in Tokyo. England defeated championship leaders South Africa 21-14 in the decider of the Sevens Word Series event. The England victory is their first since February 2013 and puts them fourth in the series so far. The 22 points moved them onto 100 and ahead of Australia into the fourth and final Olympic qualifying position available from the series. Further spots are available for next year's Rio de Janeiro Games via regional qualifiers. South Africa still lead the way after collecting 19 for the runners-up spot to move onto 129, four clear of Fiji with only two rounds left in the series in Glasgow and London next month.

Phil Burgess streaks away to score England's first of three tries in their triumph in Japan. South Africa's Cecil Afrika (centre) kicks on the run as rain stream down during the Tokyo Sevens final. The Fijian's hat-trick bid was ended by the South Africans in a nervy, error-strewn semi-final that the Blitzbokke took 7-5. New Zealand, winners of 12 of the 15 Sevens World Series titles and reigning World Cup sevens champions, endured a disappointing week in the Japanese capital, suffering a first ever loss to Canada in the quarter-finals. The 19-15 defeat sent them into the second tier Plate tournament, which they won after beating France in the last four and then Scotland in the final after Dylan Collier's try in the last play of the game.

Mitchell holds off Kok as he just makes the line for England's third try in the important seven-point win. Trans-Tasman rivals Australia dropped to fifth after a weekend to forget in Tokyo. After losing to Portugal and Scotland in group play on Saturday, they then suffered a heartbreaking defeat to the United States in the lung-busting final of the third tier Bowl event. Perry Baker scoring the match ending try in extra time as the ever-improving Americans prevailed 17-12. Portugal won the Shield after edging Argentina 12-7 but last-placed Japan closed the gap on the Iberians to eight points in the battle to avoid relegation after picking up 10 for making a first Cup quarter-final.

Article: Given the inexorable march of the past 12 months in one direction, perhaps it is only appropriate that Rory McIlroy should spend the eve of the Masters on Wednesday with a member of the celebrated boy band of that name. But it is not lookalike Harry Styles who will carry the Northern Irishman's bag in the par-three tournament but keen golfer Niall Horan as McIlroy looks for a little light relief before his first attempt to complete a career Grand Slam. One Direction released their debut album in 2011, the same year McIlroy won his first major, so you could say they have mirrored each other, hit for greatest hit. Rory McIlroy watches a tee shot during a practice round prior to the start of the 2015 Masters Tournament. McIlroy alongside his caddie Caroline Wozniacki during the 2014 Par 3 Contest  in Augusta. McIlroy celebrates with his  Wozniacki on the 9th hole during  the Par 3 contest at Augusta National Golf Club. At last year's Masters, McIlroy piqued the interest of one or two photographers when then fiancee Caroline Wozniacki donned the caddie's famous white boiler suit. He might find the curiosity levels are even greater this time, for One Direction are even more popular in the US than in Britain. Between them, Niall, an honorary member at Mullingar, Westmeath, and Rory might do more to stir up interest in golf among the young than any number of 'old fogey' initiatives. 'We met in Australia at the end of last year and he was saying he had never been to The Masters,' said McIlroy. 'I said if you're available on the Wednesday you're more than welcome to carry the bag. Niall's really excited.' Niall Horan will swap girls screams for Augusta greens as he caddies for golfer McIlroy. McIlroy hits a putt in the rain during a practice round prior to the start of the 2015 Masters Tournament. McIlroy looked more subdued than excited at his press conference yesterday, possibly because he knew what was coming. On the one hand, he feels as ready as he ever will for his tilt at history. On the other, he had to spend 30 minutes with journalists wanting to trawl over his poor record at Augusta. Here is a sample: Why is your record so bad on the par fives, Rory? Why have you never birdied either the first or the 10th holes? Why have you left here for the past five years with at least one 77 on your score card? What the hell's wrong given all the advantages offered by your length off the tee? McIlroy  walks over the Nelson Bridge with caddie J.P. Fitzgerald during a practice round. To be fair, he answered them all with politeness. After all, there was nothing there he had not analysed and dissected countless times himself. McIlroy knows better than anyone he has no chance unless he does better on the long holes. He brought up the point raised in the Sportsmail graphic from last Saturday, which compared his record on the par fives last year with that of winner Bubba Watson. 'Just look at the two par fives on the back nine on Sunday,' he said. 'I had a nine iron in my hand for my second shot on both and I walked off with two sixes. Two fours I'd have finished third. McIlroy waits under an umbrella during a practice round prior to the start of the 2015 Masters Tournament. 'It's something I've been thinking about a lot. Look at Bubba, who played them in eight-under for the week to my level par and beat me by eight shots. 'I've just been too aggressive at times. I had four sixes on par-fives last year, so if I can clean up those, I'll have a chance to win.' As for those 77s, he said: 'It's not like I'm having a bad 18 holes. It's always just a bad nine holes that causes the damage and it's usually on a Friday, like last year. But I am better equipped now to handle it if things don't go right way. Mentally, I'm in a far better place.' McIlroy conceded that the circus surrounding Tiger Woods's return had not been unhelpful and the draw has worked out pretty well, too. The place you do not want to be come Thursday is in one of the last two groups, like Woods, but McIlroy has been treated kindly, with a mid-morning threesome alongside Americans Phil Mickelson and Ryan Moore. 'I don't think I've played alongside Phil at Augusta so that's perfect,' he said. 'We always get along well and he has a great record here. It will be fun to watch him.' It was this time last week, while practising in Florida, that McIlroy pronounced himself ready to go. 'It's been great not to have to think of anything technical while I'm playing,' he said. 'I've been able to enjoy the build-up.' Rory McIlroy waits with his caddie Fitzgerald in the rain during a practice round  at Augusta National Golf Club. Asked who he saw as favourite, McIlroy went for Bubba — ironic given a recent ESPN survey among the pros ranked Watson as the least favourite. 'I take it as I need to improve as a man,' said Watson, with the sort of annoying comment that explains his unpopularity in the first place. As for McIlroy, he knows where he needs to improve. 'You look at this course and it should fit me perfectly from tee to green,' he said. After One Direction on Wednesday, it'll be his turn to generate some roars.

Article: Louis van Gaal couldn’t let the moment pass. Manchester United had just rattled off their 13th home win of the season and the Dutchman wanted to crank up the pressure. A comfortable victory over Aston Villa, inspired by two goals from the excellent Ander Herrera and crowned by Wayne Rooney’s magnificent strike, had seen United leap above Manchester City in the table for the first time since November 23, 2013. When you think on January 10 this year the gap between the two clubs was 10 points, the turnaround has been remarkable. But now, as they head into their latest local squabble, there is mounting confidence around Old Trafford that United will not surrender their position. Louis van Gaal has piled pressure on Manchester City ahead of their games against Crystal Palace and United. Manchester United picked up all three points at the weekend by beating Aston Villa 3-1 at Old Trafford. Van Gaal believes Manchester City's players may struggle to get to grips with being in fourth spot. MANCHESTER UNITED (4-3-3): De Gea 6; Valencia 7, Jones 7, Rojo 7, Blind 7: Herrera 8.5, Carrick 7, Fellaini 6.5 (Falcao 77mins): Mata 7.5, Rooney 8, Young 6.5 (Di Maria 70. 6.5) Subs not used: Valdes, Rafael, Januzaj, McNair, Pereira. Scorers: Herrera 43, 90, Rooney 79. ASTON VILLA (4-4-2): Guzan 7: Hutton 5.5 (Bacuna 46, 5), Okore 5.5, Clark 5.5, Lowton 5: N’Zogbia 5 (Baker 61, 5), Sanchez 6, Delph 6, Weimann 5 (Cole 77): Benteke 6.5, Agbonlahor 5. Subs not used: Given, Vlaar, Gil, Grealish. Booked: Delph. Scorer: Benteke 80. Man of the match: Ander Herrera. Referee: Roger East 6. Is it feasible for City to finish fourth? They face Crystal Palace on Monday evening and Van Gaal believes dropping down two positions will creep into the psychology of Manuel Pellegrini’s squad. Even if City win at Selhurst Park, how will they handle the furnace that awaits this Sunday? ‘It plays a part in the spirit of the players — of our opponents but also our players,’ said Van Gaal. ‘We have more confidence now and when (if) they lose a point against Crystal Palace, then it is also sitting in their minds. ‘I don’t know the individual players of Manchester City so well, so I cannot judge them. But we have a lot of confidence and we haven’t lost so many times at home. The next game is going to be the decisive game.’ Van Gaal is aware recent history spells doom for United. They have lost seven of the last nine Manchester derbies, including each of the last four. Remarkably, they have not beaten City at home since Rooney scored that breath-taking bicycle kick in February 2011. City, few would dispute, have the better squad but, regardless of what happens in south London, will they be able to hold United’s momentum? Can they match their spirit? Big games are bringing the best out of Van Gaal’s men and they are clearly relishing the opportunity that awaits. Manchester United have not beaten City at Old Trafford since Wayne Rooney's wonder goal in February 2011. Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero scored in his side's 1-0 win over United back in November. Rooney likes playing against Villa — this was his 13th career goal against them. Newcastle (12) are his second favourite opponents. Man United lead rivals Man City by one point. ‘It was another Manchester United, I believe,’ said Van Gaal, when asked how he reflected on the 1-0 defeat he suffered at the Etihad Stadium in November. ‘We have developed the team. That was more in the start of the process and now we are in the end of the process. ‘So I think also the confidence of our players is very high at the moment but also our performances shows that so it’s not the same Manchester United. It’s like the game against Liverpool and the game (coming up) against Chelsea — you have to win these kinds of matches.’ With Liverpool’s defeat by Arsenal effectively ending the doubt over which sides will finish in the top four, it now becomes a question of what order Chelsea, Arsenal and the two Manchester clubs will be after the final games have been played. United’s run-in is laced with demanding assignments — aside from City, they must go to Stamford Bridge on April 18, face a trip to Goodison Park the following week and host Arsenal on May 16 — but they have an aura once more. Manchester United defender Chris Smalling saw red during the Premier League clash at the Etihad Stadium. Man United vs Man City - April 12. Chelsea vs Man United - April 18. Everton vs Man United - April 26. Man United vs West Brom - May 2. Crystal Palace vs Man United - May 9. Man United vs Arsenal - May 17. Hull vs Man United - May 24. Crystal Palace vs Man City - April 6. Man United vs Man City - April 12. Man City vs West Ham - April 19. Man City vs Aston Villa - April 25. Tottenham vs Man City - May 3. Man City vs QPR - May 10. Swansea vs Man City - May 17. Man City vs Southampton - May 24. Villa, stymied by injury problems that Tim Sherwood described as ‘crippling’, simply couldn’t cope once they went conceded in the 43rd minute and the manager, who was noticeably glum afterwards, can at least take solace from the fact Queens Park Rangers will not offer the same threat on Tuesday. ‘We know it will be tough but as long as we can play the way we have shown, especially in the last few games, it’s going to be a great game,’ said Ashley Young, who admitted he was ‘disappointed’ to not be selected for the last round of England games. ‘Hopefully we will get the three points. Of course it would be nice but we are just taking each game as it comes.’ There was never any hint they would slip up here, bossing the first half and then going through the gears after a slow period after the break to swat Villa aside. Herrara, with his slick passing and industry, was terrific. Rooney’s 14th strike of the campaign, meanwhile, was sensational. ‘It's about momentum, especially when you are going into this vital stage of the season,’ Young added. ‘United teams always come strong at this stage and we are showing in every game just how strong we can be – and even how we finish the game. We will enjoy this but it is all about next week.’ Ashley Young (left, pictured with Herrera) believes his side are building momentum ahead of the derby.

Article: (CNN)A French-language global television network regained control of one of its 11 channels Thursday after a cyberattack a day earlier crippled its broadcasts and social media accounts. Television network TV5Monde was gradually regaining control of its channels and social media outlets after suffering what the network's director called an "extremely powerful cyberattack." In addition to its 11 channels, TV5Monde lost control of its social media outlets and its websites, director Yves Bigot said in a video message posted later on Facebook. On a mobile site, which was still active, the network said it was "hacked by an Islamist group." ISIS logos and markings appeared on  TV5Monde social media accounts. But there was no immediate claim of responsibility by ISIS or any other group. As day broke Thursday in Europe, the network had regained the use of one of its 11 channels and its Facebook page, Paul Germain, the chain's editor in chief, told BFMTV, a CNN affiliate in France. However, by late morning, a number of pages on the network's website had messages saying they were under maintenance. The outage began around 8:45 p.m. Paris time (2:45 p.m. ET) on Wednesday. TV5Monde offers round-the-clock entertainment and news programming that reaches 260 million homes worldwide, according to the Ministry of Culture and Communications. It functions under a partnership among the governments of France, Canada and Switzerland, as well as the Wallonia-Brussels Federation. Other networks that provide content to TV5Monde include CNN affiliates France 2 and France 3, France 24 and Radio France International.

Article: Jolyon Palmer is determined to claim a place in Formula One next year after being given the perfect opportunity by Lotus to prove himself worthy. For the first time the Enstone-based marque are providing their test and reserve driver with a number of outings in Friday's first practice session ahead of grand prix weekends. Ordinarily in the past, Lotus' reserve has been nothing more than a spare part, stood on the sidelines whilst the race drivers completed their tasks. Jolyon Palmer will drive in every Friday practice session for Lotus this season. This year, however, Lotus have decided Palmer will get a shot, and not just as a driver doing all the donkey work too. Every Friday Palmer will be behind the wheel - as was the case in China last week and again in Bahrain this week - his run-plan will be similar to that of whoever he replaces. In China, Palmer was only 0.6secs behind Pastor Maldonado at the end of FP1, a tremendous effort given it was Palmer's first major outing at an F1 event. If Palmer can continue to push, or even on occasion better the times of Maldonado and team-mate Romain Grosjean, doors may open. 'I want to be really pushing the race drivers. That's the aim,' said Palmer. 'I'm pretty much running on the same run plan as those guys. It's not like we've seen in FP1 sessions before with other drivers where they have been on quali settings, engine turned up or low fuel. 'This year there's a direct comparison and I want to show why I should be racing next year.' Unfortunately for last year's GP2 champion, his lack of competitive work outside of his duties with Lotus may prove a hindrance. Palmer drives  during practice for the Chinese Grand Prix last weekend. The 24-year-old from Horsham would love to be keeping his hand in, but knows it is something he has to sacrifice to keep his F1 dream alive. 'I want to race, but only if I get the right offer,' added Palmer, son of former F1 driver Jonathan. 'If I get a good offer to do something that would be a good career move for me then I'd like to race. 'It's about keeping sharp. It's the one thing I'm missing this year. 'I'm loving working with Lotus and being in F1, but I'd love to be racing as well, so if I get a good offer I'd love to.' Palmer, though, is not actively seeking further employment because of his commitment to Lotus, adding: 'My main focus is all here and I'm really busy anyway. 'If something came my way then I would definitely consider it, but my main priority is Lotus and I will not compromise anything I do here by racing elsewhere. 'But if there is something that came along that could fit in with this then I'd be happy to do it.'

Article: Liverpool midfielder Lucas Leiva is relishing the prospect of a long-awaited Wembley appearance after injury robbed him of the chance three years ago. The Reds made three trips to the national stadium in 2012 after winning the League Cup and losing the FA Cup to Chelsea, but the Brazil international missed all of them with a serious knee injury sustained in the previous November. But having played his part in the 1-0 quarter-final win at Blackburn, Lucas is hoping to get his chance in the last-four encounter with Aston Villa on April 19. Lucas Leiva (right) celebrates with Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers after getting to the FA Cup semi-final. Lucas (left) challenges Markus Olsson as Liverpool beat Blackburn 1-0 in the FA Cup quarter-final replay. Lucas can play his first game at Wembley in a Liverpool shirt when they meet Aston Villa in the semi-final. 'Unfortunately I got an injury before we got to Wembley so I missed [the chance to play there],' he said. 'Hopefully I'll be fit and be able to play at Wembley. I've never played there, so it will be a very good experience and after many years here, to have that chance is amazing. 'I think everyone could see how hard we worked. We knew it was going to be a very hard game in difficult conditions, but I think we did well and we are so happy to get to Wembley and hopefully get to the final.' Victory over Blackburn intensified talk of the team giving captain Steven Gerrard, who departs for Los Angeles Galaxy, the perfect send-off as his birthday falls on the day of the final. However, the midfielder was suspended for the tie at Ewood Park and it was Lucas's compatriot Philippe Coutinho who made the difference with a 70th-minute strike, having scored a brilliant last-minute winner in a fourth-round replay at Bolton. Coutinho has arguably been Liverpool's best player over the last five months having not only finally seemed to have grown in stature as a playmaker but also adding goals to his armoury. 'I have known him for a very long time and I know what he's capable of doing,' Lucas told liverpoolfc.com. 'He's becoming an even bigger player for the club and he's got a long way to go in terms of age and experience, but he's already right there with the top players.' Another player whose form has taken a significant upturn during that period is goalkeeper Simon Mignolet, who produced two excellent saves to keep a clean sheet against Rovers and even stopped opposite number Simon Eastwood scoring what would have been the most dramatic of equalisers after the Rovers keeper came up for a throw-in in added time. The Belgium international has overcome his early-season wobbles when he seemed to be the cause of much of Liverpool's defensive frailties. He admits victory over Blackburn was important after back-to-back Premier League defeats put a huge dent in their Champions League aspirations. 'After the result against Arsenal there wasn't much time to think because we knew there was going to be a game on Wednesday,' Mignolet said. 'So we had to recover well, put the focus to Blackburn and then make sure that we did the things we wanted to do. 'I think the lads and the team responded really well, did their jobs and did what the gaffer asked us to do, and we managed to get the result we wanted. 'We needed to bounce back after two disappointing results against Manchester United and Arsenal and we did that. 'We gave something back to the fans, who have got something to look forward to now as well with a trip to Wembley. Philippe Coutinho (right) scored the decisive goal for Liverpool, drilling a low shot in off the far post. Simon Mignolet (left) produced another commanding display in goal for Liverpool at Ewood Park. Mignloet praised the Liverpool supporters and is targeting reaching the final of the FA Cup. 'They stand behind us at every single away game, they turn up in numbers and it's always nice to play in front of that crowd. 'They pushed us forward and they have something to look forward to now with a big game at Wembley. Hopefully we can get to the final as well.' As a result of Liverpool's semi-final involvement their league match at Hull scheduled for that weekend has been rescheduled for Tuesday, April 28 at the KC Stadium.

Article: Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina has a Premier League win ratio of 91.7 per cent - the highest of any player to have made at least 10 appearances. Following the Gunners' 1-0 win against Burnley at Turf Moor on Saturday, the Colombia international took his tally to 11 wins from 12 games since he displaced Wojciech Szczesny as No 1 in January. Ospina has kept six clean sheets in those 12 games with his only defeat coming against Tottenham in the north London derby on February 7 to boast an impressive win percentage. But who else makes the top 10? Ospina has the highest win ratio of any Premier League player to make more than 10 appearances. The Arsenal goalkeeper has won 11 of his 12 games in the league since displacing Wojciech Szczesny. Former Manchester City defender Stefan Savic (right) won 10 of his 11 games in the league before being sold. Former Manchester City defender Stefan Savic, who was deemed not good enough after making just 11 Premier League appearances before being sold to Fiorentina, is second behind Ospina. The Montenegro international has a win ratio of 90.9 per cent after appearing on the losing side just once during his only season with the Premier League champions. Gerard Pique, who spent four years at Manchester United, makes up the top three after winning 10 of his 12 Premier League games before rejoining Barcelona and going on to win countless trophies, including a World Cup with Spain. Gerard Pique made 12 Premier League appearances for Manchester United, winning 10 of them. Arjen Robben posts an impressive 82.1 per cent win ration in the Premier League from 67 matches. Asier del Horno won 20 times during his only season in the Premier League with Chelsea in 2005-06. Arjen Robben has arguably the most impressive stats of any player on the list for the number of appearances he made for Chelsea during a three-year spell. The Bayern Munich winger was on the winning side an incredible 55 times from his 67 games giving him a win ration of 82.1 per cent. Another former Chelsea player Asier del Horno is fifth on the list with 80 per cent and is followed by current Arsenal right back Hector Bellerin with 78.6. Arsenal right back Hector Bellerin (left) has won 11 of his 14 league games this season. Manchester United forward James Wilson has won 10 of 13 appearances in the league. Igor Stepanov made 17 appearances for Arsenal in the early 2000s and won 13 matches. Manchester United's 19-year-old striker James Wilson has only failed to be on the winning side three times from his 13 appearances putting him seventh on the list, while former Arsenal defender Igor Stepanovs' 76.5 per cent is enough to put him eighth. Nacho Monreal, currently preferred to Kieran Gibbs as Arsenal left back, has won 43 games from his 57 appearances for Arsene Wenger's side. United defender Paddy McNair sneaks into the top 10 with 75 per cent having featured 12 times under Louis van Gaal this season, winning nine. When did Ospina join Arsenal? Arsenal signed Ospina from Ligue 1 side Nice last summer. The 26-year-old made close to 200 appearances for the French club during six seasons. How much did Arsenal pay for him? Originally signed as back-up and competition for Wojciech Szczesny after the Gunners No 2 Lukasz Fabianski joined Swansea, Ospina cost a paltry £3million. Is he of international calibre? Ospina had won 52 caps for Colombia and impressed during their run to the World Cup quarter-final in Brazil last summer. When did Ospina make his first appearance for Arsenal? Ospina made his debut for Arsenal in a 2-1 defeat by Southampton in the third round of the Capital One Cup back in September and only made one further appearance in the Champions League before 2015. When did he displace Wojciech Szczesny as No 1? Ospina was recalled to the starting line-up as Arsenal beat Hull 2-0 in the FA Cup third round in January after Szczesny was at fault for both goals during a 2-0 defeat by Southampton. It later emerged that the Poland goalkeeper was caught smoking in the showers after the game. Ospina kept his place for the league game the following week and has played every Premier League match since. Did you know... Ospina is brother-in-law to Real Madrid midfielder and Colombia team-mate James Rodriguez. The former Monaco star married Ospina's sister Daniela in 2011.

Article: Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (CNN)Lost luggage after a long flight is a common, frustrating occurrence of modern air travel. And sometimes, airlines lose things that are irreplaceable. American Jennifer Stewart says she was devastated to learn that Etihad Airways lost her most important baggage following a recent trip from Abu Dhabi to New York City: her 2-year-old pet cat, Felix. Stewart said that she and her husband, Joseph Naaman, booked Felix on their Etihad Airways flight from the United Arab Emirates to New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport on April 1. Shortly after the plane arrived in New York that evening, Felix went missing somewhere on the grounds of Kennedy Airport, according to Etihad Airways. Felix was able to get loose, Stewart said she believes, because the cat's plastic carrier was badly damaged at some point either during the flight or the transfer from the airplane to the pickup area. Stewart said a cargo manager called the couple to an office after they landed at Kennedy last week and notified them that their cat's carrier had been crushed. Photographs taken by Stewart showed a large hole in the top of the cat's carrier. At least one of the corners of the case appeared partially collapsed. Nearly one week later, Felix remains missing. "For them to take a cat and ship him like he was cargo, not a live animal, makes me sick," Stewart said.  "You trust that people care and are doing the job well, and then this happens." A representative for Etihad Airways told CNN that that the loss of pets during air travel is "extremely rare."  The airline shipped more than 200 pets last year. Etihad Airways is investigating the incident and is working with ground handlers at the New York airport to help locate the missing cat. The Abu Dhabi-based carrier also said it hired "third-party specialists" to help in the hunt for Felix. "We deeply regret this unfortunate incident and are keeping the owner apprised of the progress of the search," Etihad Airways told CNN in a statement. "We will review our pet handling procedures in the wake of this incident, as the safety and care of pets traveling with Etihad Airways is a top priority." Stewart and her husband booked the cat's flight as part of their job relocation to the United States after living in Abu Dhabi for more than three years. The couple said they spent $1,200 to ship Felix on the 14-hour flight. "You pay all of this money, but for what? People assume you pay extra to have your pets taken care of, but they're treated no differently than a free piece of checked luggage," Stewart said. It isn't the first time a pet has gone missing at New York's busiest airport. In August 2011, a cat escaped from its carrier before an American Airlines flight from New York to San Francisco. That cat was eventually discovered -- alive -- two months later in a customs room at the airport. But the cat later had to be euthanized because of injuries and malnutrition it suffered while lost. This weekend, Stewart enlisted the help of a local nonprofit, which provided a highly trained detection dog, to help track down Felix's scent. A wildlife biologist who works with the airport has also placed traps to facilitate Felix's safe return, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Officials at Kennedy have offered to assist Etihad Airways as the airline investigates what happened, the Port Authority said. Stewart said the couple will continue to search the airport until they have answers. "We just want to find Felix. But I just don't know if we will," she said.

Article: Barcelona's Brazilian star Neymar was left fuming after being substituted by Luis Enrique during the 2-2 draw at Sevilla on Saturday night, according to reports in Spain. Neymar, who scored his side's second goal with a curling free kick, was replaced with the score at 2-1 and 15 minutes to play. Sevilla then scored a late equaliser, and Neymar 'can't understand why he is subbed so much' reports Spanish paper Sport. Neymar's dispute with Luis Enrique features prominently in Spain, while they look ahead to the Madrid derby. The paper points out that the forward has been replaced in 15 of his 34 matches this season, with only Ivan Rakitic and Andres Iniesta being substituted more. With Barcelona still top of La Liga, and challenging for a treble, the paper points out that the club will need to be united in the final run-in. Elsewhere in Spain the attention is focused on the Madrid derby in this week's Champions League quarter-finals. Marca claims that the game is 'like a final', with the two teams playing out a repeat of last year's showdown in Lisbon, while in AS, Real defender Pepe calls for intensity and humility. In Italy the headlines are dominated by Lazio, who moved above their city rivals Roma into second place in Serie A with a win over Empoli. AS also look ahead to the Champions League quarter-final, while in Italy the focus is on Lazio's win.

Article: He has been a colossus of the game. He has made 700 professional club appearances and won 81 caps for England, six Premier League titles, the FA Cup and the Champions League. In his pomp, he was the stuff of strikers' nightmares, driving some of the world's greatest goalscorers to distraction with lightning-sharp reactions and an instinctive reading of the game. That's why it's such a shame that what is likely to be Rio Ferdinand's farewell year in the English game has fizzled out. Rio Ferdinand pictured in training at Queens Park Rangers last week. The 36-year-old defender started regularly in the first part of the season but has been unable to hold down his spot in the side. Ferdinand started the first seven matches of QPR's Premier League campaign before being dropped. Ferdinand has enjoyed a fantastic career, winning six Premier League titles, but a fairytale finish is unlikely. Ferdinand and Ryan Giggs lift the European Cup for Manchester United in Moscow back in 2008. Ferdinand also won 81 caps for England during his glittering career. He would love to be out there, hunting down and hassling opponents, robbing attackers of the ball, winning the aerial duels, playing his part in Queens Park Rangers' survival mission. Keeping them up would be a fitting curtain call. Instead, Ferdinand's season has been one spent on the margins - either suspended, benched or out of the squad altogether. Once again, the 36-year-old was forced to watch on from the sidelines as Rangers claimed a potentially crucial point away to Aston Villa on Tuesday night. Ferdinand had picked up a slight knock and was ruled out. He has played just five times since the start of October - not much of a swansong. On Sunday, he posted a Twitter picture of a pile of chicken bones after lunch at his mum's. He had not been involved in the 4-1 win at West Brom 24 hours earlier and it weirdly seemed to sum up his peripheral role at the moment. By contrast, Ferdinand had started QPR's first seven games of the campaign, lasting the full 90 minutes in all of them. Harry Redknapp had grand plans and the best of intentions last summer. Having called time on his Manchester United career after 12 trophy-laden seasons, Ferdinand moved to Loftus Road in what Redknapp described as a'remarkable coup for the club.' Harry Redknapp described Ferdinand's signing last summer as a'remarkable coup' for the club. But after initial promise, Ferdinand has largely spent the season on the bench. Premier League (6): 2002-03, 2006-07, 2007-08, 2008-09, 2010-11, 2012-13. FA Cup (1): 2003-04. Football League Cup (2): 2005-06, 2008-09. FA Community Shield (5): 2003, 2007, 2008, 2011, 2013. Champions League (1): 2007-08. FIFA Club World Cup (1): 2008. Even in his mid-thirties, Redknapp believed Ferdinand would bring 'quality, class, experience and know-how' as QPR returned to the top flight. He envisaged Ferdinand in a sweeper role, the central pivot of a three-man defence in an in-vogue 3-5-2 system. He would bring all that experience to bear, helping Clint Hill and Steven Caulker keep opposition attacks at bay. Unfortunately, it just didn't work. In their first seven Premier League games of the season, QPR won one, drew one and lost five. They leaked 15 goals and the scale of their task in staying in the top division was clear. Ferdinand was demoted to the bench, Richard Dunne and Nedum Onuoha were introduced and the dye was cast for the season. His suspension for using the word'sket' in a tweet didn't help and by the time that was served, Ferdinand was down the pecking order. Ferdinand has shown glimpses of his imperious best for QPR this season. But Ferdinand's farewell season in English football has not lived up to his expectations. Chris Ramsey has played Ferdinand on three occasions since taking over from Harry Redknapp. Queens Park Rangers find themselves two points from safety after their 3-3 draw at Aston Villa on Tuesday. As you would expect, Ferdinand has conducted himself like a model professional on the training ground, maintaining his fitness in case he was called upon. And there have been such occasions, notably the 2-0 win at Sunderland in February - Chris Ramsey's second game in charge after replacing Redknapp, that ended QPR's 11-game losing run on the road. Ferdinand may yet be called upon again in the run-in, with QPR sitting two points shy of safety, but the season so far will have fallen short of his hopes and expectations. That fairytale finale, with Ferdinand leading an heroic resistance to keep Rangers in the Premier League, seems unlikely. There are rumours that clubs in the money-soaked Qatar Stars League are preparing to tempt Ferdinand with one final payday but that remains to be seen. For now, Rio's farewell has sadly fallen a bit flat. The fixtures remaining for the bottom six in the Barclays Premier League.

Rio Ferdinand missed 3-3 thriller with Aston Villa through injury. He has featured in just five QPR matches since the start of October. Harry Redknapp initially wanted him to be at centre of a back three. But the plan backfired as Rangers made a poor start in Premier League. Ferdinand has found it difficult to regain his place in farewell year.

Article: SPFL clubs are poised to do battle over a late Hibernian move to cash in on the Premiership play-offs. Currently second in the Championship, the Easter Road club stand to make £1million from anticipated sell-out home gates against Rangers and the 11th place club in the Premiership - currently Motherwell. Under recently passed SPFL rules, however, play-off sides must hand over 50 per cent of their play-off profits for distribution among lower league clubs within seven days. And, faced with the possible loss of substantial sums from two lucrative matches, Hibs chairman Rod Petrie has garnered support from Hearts and Motherwell for a resolution to slash the profits levied from play-off finalists from 50 per cent to 25 per cent. The issue will go to the vote at the SPFL AGM next Thursday, but faces opposition from the SPFL board who believe the move puts self-interest above those of all 42 clubs. Hibernian face a battle over potentially lucrative gate revenues with lower league clubs. On Tuesday, one senior club figure told Sportsmail on condition of anonymity, that the Hibs, Hearts and Motherwell proposal was ‘outrageous’. ‘The agreement two years ago was that the clubs from the bottom three divisions would get more of the money,’ Sportsmail was told. ‘As part of that overall package we agreed a levy on the play-offs. No one at that time anticipated you might have a Rangers-Hibs play-off final. ‘Now there is a move by people with vested interests to say “we might be doing ourselves out of a bit of money!”. And they are attempting to revisit it. ‘That’s potentially outrageous because all clubs voted for the restructuring on the basis of the overall package and you can’t suddenly decide later that because you are in the play-offs you are not happy with it.’ Hibernian declined to comment last night although the Easter Road club will argue that funding for lower league clubs will be unaffected by slashing the levy because of a new six-figure broadcast deal for the play-offs and the imposition by the SPFL of new minimum pricing policy of £15 and £10 for all six matches. Hibs would have to hand over 50 per cent of play-off gate revenues to lower league clubs under SPFL rules. Hibernian are believed to have had reservations over the 50 per cent levy before the redistribution package was passed and have now gathered backing to revisit the issue next Thursday from Motherwell – also likely to be involved in the play-offs – and city rivals Hearts. One Easter Road source told Sportsmail: ‘A rule change has been introduced by the SPFL stopping clubs allowing their season ticket holders into the play-off games for free. ‘They have also imposed a minimum price of £15 and £10 for the play-offs. ‘In addition there was no television money in place for the play-offs last year while this year they have secured six-figure revenues to go round the clubs. ‘Add in the fact the parachute payments to the Premiership clubs are fully funded by the SFA – not the SPFL – and people at Hibs take the view that to hand back 50 per cent of the money generated is excessive and unnecessary. The suggestion that it be reduced is not unreasonable. Hearts and Motherwell agree.’

Hibernian stand to make £1million from gate revenues in play-offs. Edinburgh club battling to try and reduce share to lower league clubs. Hibs would have to give 50 per cent of gate revenues to lower teams. Club has received support from Hearts and Motherwell to lower to 25%.

Article: (CNN)The nation's top stories will be unfolding Tuesday in courthouses and political arenas across the country. Massachusetts is hosting two of the highest-profile court trials in recent memory -- those of former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez and Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Both lengthy trials are coming to a close. In Louisville, Kentucky, Sen. Rand Paul made the not-so-surprising announcement that he will run for president, while in Chicago, voters will head to the polls in a very surprising runoff between Mayor Rahm Emanuel and challenger Jesus "Chuy" Garcia. And in Ferguson, Missouri, the shadow of Michael Brown and the protests over his shooting by Officer Darren Wilson will loom large over the city's elections. Here's a breakdown of what to expect today and how we got here:. Tsarnaev, who's accused of detonating a bomb at the 2013 Boston Marathon along with his now-deceased brother, faces the stiffest of penalties -- life in prison or the death penalty -- if he's found guilty on any of 17 capital counts against him, including setting off weapons of mass destruction at a public event as an act of terrorism. The 13th juror: What defense? On Monday, survivors and victims' families wept and Tsarnaev fidgeted at a defense table as jurors heard a prosecutor allege that the 21-year-old "brought terrorism into the backyards and main streets." The jury on Tuesday morning began what is expected to be a lengthy deliberation process on 30 total charges, before the so-called penalty phase, should he be found guilty on any counts. It took prosecutors months to present 131 witnesses to support their claim that Hernandez killed semi-pro player Odin Lloyd, yet on Monday, Hernandez's defense team wrapped up its witnesses in less than a day. Closing arguments are scheduled for Tuesday, and the jury will begin deliberations soon thereafter. Jurors in Fall River, Massachusetts, will be asked to decide if Hernandez is culpable in the shooting death of Lloyd, whose body was found in a Massachusetts industrial park in the summer of 2013. Much of the evidence against Hernandez is circumstantial, and among the facts the jury will be asked to take into consideration are New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft's testimony, the testimony of Hernandez's fiancee, some grainy footage from Hernandez's home security system and a footprint left by a Nike Air Jordan shoe. Hernandez known for swagger, even in court. OK, sure, no one was floored when the Kentucky senator announced his bid for the Oval Office, but of course it was news when he made it official Tuesday. Paul is expected to hit the campaign trail visiting the all-important early voters in New Hampshire, South Carolina, Iowa and Nevada. The physician rode a wave of tea party popularity into the Senate in 2010, where he carefully built a brand of mainstream libertarianism, and he is banking on a coalition of younger voters and traditional Republicans to usher him into the White House. Paul and Sen. Ted Cruz are the only declared candidates for the GOP nomination, though the field will certainly grow and could include the likes of Florida's Jeb Bush, New Jersey's Chris Christie, Wisconsin's Scott Walker, South Carolina's Lindsey Graham and Florida's Marco Rubio. Would Rand be here without Ron? It's the Windy City's first runoff for a citywide office, and it's being billed as a battle for the "future of Chicago." In one corner, you have Emanuel, President Barack Obama's notoriously hard-charging former chief of staff, and in the other, you have Jesus "Chuy" Garcia, a county commissioner who has come to embody populist and liberal Democrats' frustrations with the Chicago incumbent. After Emanuel failed to snare half the vote in February's general election, he will go head-to-head with Garcia. The timing is interesting, too, as Easter, Passover and spring break appear to have spurred more than 142,000 early votes, up from about 90,000 before the first round of voting in February. Following Michael Brown's death, the national spotlight shone on Ferguson, particularly how the city's predominantly black population is woefully underrepresented in its police force and City Council. Yet with all the hubbub about the face of civic leadership, only four in 10 city residents hit the polls in November to cast ballots. Residents speak out ahead of vote. Tuesday's election will bring change, no matter how the ballots are cast: Two black men are running for one of the open seats, and the current lone black council member isn't up for re-election. In another ward, two black women and two white men are vying for an open seat. And a white protester is running for a third post.

Article: Dundee have vowed to stand by Paul McGowan after the bad boy midfielder was spared jail for a third assault on a policeman. But the Dens Park bad boy will miss two forthcoming games against former club Celtic because he is under house arrest. The 27-year-old has been placed on a 16-week restriction of liberty order which confines him to home between the hours of 7pm and 7am. And the Dark Blues face Ronny Deila's night next Wednesday night – before a Friday night trip to Parkhead on May 1. McGowan was handed his third conviction for assaulting a police officer at Airdrie Sheriff Court. As a St Mirren player he was sentenced to 130 hours of unpaid work and handed a one-year supervision order in January 2014 after admitting kicking two officers. The court heard McGowan 'charged towards' two police officers after a disturbance in Airdrie in the early hours of November 23 last year. He later kicked another officer on the body while being detained at Coatbridge police station. Paul McGowan avoided a prison sentence after a third assault on a policeman. Sheriff Derek O'Carroll spared the Dens star a prison sentence after hearing he had was undergoing counselling through PFA Scotland, the players' union, for a gambling problem in addition to social work sessions. In a statement Dundee vowed to support their player through his problems saying: 'The club does not condone the behaviour which has led to this and wouldn't from any member of our staff. 'We fully respect the decision made by the court and Dundee FC will be standing by the player. 'Paul is an integral part of the club and we will be working alongside the PFA with him as he bids to positively resolve his off the field issues. 'With the support of his manager, his teammates and club staff we hope Paul will be able to move forward and be part of another successful season next year at Dens Park. 'The club will be making no further comment on the matter.' His solicitor, Liam O'Donnell, told the court that social work reports 'finally give some indication that the accused is getting it in terms of his offending. He added: 'He was not in any trouble from the age of 16 to 23. At age 23 he separated from his partner. The reason he separated has been attributed to an underlying gambling problem. The 27-year-old Dundee midfielder pictured in action against Dundee United last week. 'This gambling problem seems to be the root of his offending. When he takes alcohol his anger about the gambling problem seems to come out through aggression.' O'Donnell revealed the former St Mirren player was undergoing voluntary counselling each week through the Paisley-based RCA Trust, which helps people with alcohol and gambling addictions. 'He is fully supported by his club,' he added. 'The managing director of Dundee Football Club is present in court to indicate his support because he is addressing matters.' After listening to the address, Sheriff O'Carroll reminded McGowan of the previous occasions he had been convicted of offences, in 2010 and 2013. 'And here you are again facing similar charges,' O'Carroll added. 'It's quite correct to say that you are on the cusp of custody and certainly that's in the thoughts of the court.' However, he proceeded to sentence McGowan to the tagging order provided he continues with the counselling. 'If you breach the order you will be brought back here and I have already advised you what the outcome will be,' the sheriff added. Dundee managing director John Nelms, who was accompanied in court by players including captain James McPake, declined to answer questions outside court. McGowan also declined to comment but O'Donnell said afterwards: 'He is relieved with the outcome and he knows he needs to modify his behaviour. He appreciates the support of his club and others.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Paul McGowan avoided a jail sentence after police attack. Midfielder under house arrest and will miss two games against Celtic. The 27-year-old is on a 16-week restriction of liberty order.

Article: Roberto Martinez complained Seamus Coleman should have been awarded a free-kick before the Everton defender conceded the penalty that allowed Swansea to pinch a 1-1 draw at the Liberty Stadium. Everton manager Martinez felt Coleman had been barged by home striker Marvin Emnes before the Irish right-back scooped away the ball with his hands. And Martinez claimed referee Michael Oliver should have risen above the appeals from the Swansea faithful and used 'common sense' to rule in favour of Everton. Seamus Coleman falls over under the challenge from Marvin Emnes and handles the ball. Coleman appears to apologise to the visiting fans at the full-time whistle, but his manager says he was fouled. Martinez said on BT Sport 1: 'My thoughts are that straight away there is contact. Seamus tells me straight away there is contact and he gets unbalanced. 'Sometimes you need to apply a little bit of common sense. 'Clearly there's contact. I've seen it many times given as a free-kick. 'The whole action for me is too soft. I don't think that there's enough threat or a goalscoring threat to give a penalty. 'He's trying to protect the ball and gets unbalanced and from that point he expects the free-kick to be given. The Everton players protest but Michael Oliver deemed Coleman's handball deliberate, and gave a penalty. Jonjo Shelvey made no mistake from the spot as the former Liverpool midfielder equalised for Swansea. 'It's one of those actions where you expect the referee to be a little bit more above the occasion. 'You felt the crowd were asking for two or three decisions and it was building up to a decision and unfortunately we were on the receiving end.' Martinez labelled the result 'a real disappointment', after Aaron Lennon's first-half strike had looked set to give the visitors all three points. Jonjo Shelvey tucked away the penalty equaliser in the 69th minute. Martinez added: 'The only criticism is we had a period of 10, 15, 20 minutes where we were too comfortable in the second half and didn't find that final shot or try to score the second goal, but apart from that I do feel the draw doesn't reflect what happened.' Roberto Martinez was clearly angry with the referee's decision as his current side were held by his old club.

Seamus Coleman was penalised for handling in the penalty aread. Coleman went down under pressure from Marvin Emnes. Roberto Martinez insisted after the game his player had been pushed. Michael Oliver decided it was a penalty, which Jonjo Shelvey converted.

Article: (CNN)A mammoth fire broke out Friday morning in a Kentucky industrial park, sending plumes of thick smoke over the area as authorities worked to contain the damage. The blaze began shortly before 7 a.m. at the General Electric Appliance Park in Louisville, according to Mike Weimer from the city's emergency management agency. He said that there were no reports of anyone injured or trapped. Video showed both smoke and bright orange flames. Firefighters took up positions around the affected buildings, spraying water from the periphery. Weimer told CNN that authorities didn't know what had caused the fire, which had gone to at least four alarms. According to a GE website, its facility in the Louisville Appliance Park is "revitalizing manufacturing in the United States." The park is large, such that 34 football fields could fit in one of its warehouses in the facility.

Article: A seller on eBay has claimed that he has former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez's jailhouse identification card - and he's trying to auction it off. The eBay listing, posted Friday, showed a laminated badge featuring a photo of Hernandez, 25, and identifying information, including his height, weight and birth date. Hernandez is currently in prison during his trial for the the June 2013 shooting death of Odin Lloyd, who was dating his fiancée's sister. Lloyd was shot six times in an industrial park less than a mile from Hernandez's home. Scroll down for video. An eBay user posted what appears to be laminated badge that featured a photo of former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez and identifying information about the 25-year-old. The listing on eBay claimed that it was selling Hernandez's Suffolk County jail ID card, according to CBS Boston. 'I was in jail with Aaron Hernandez the for patriot super star.. I happen to com across his jail id (sic),' the user posted. The starting price for the card was $500, though there were no bids on the item when the auction was removed from the site on Saturday. It is unclear whether the user or eBay staff removed the auction item from the site. The listing, which was deleted on Saturday and had zero bids, was posted by a user who claimed he was in jail with Hernandez. Jurors in Hernandez's trial deliberated for nearly 20 hours over the last week considering whether to convict the former football player. They return to court on Monday. In addition to the murder charge, they must decide whether to convict him on charges of illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition. Two friends of Hernandez, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, are also charged with murder and will be tried separately. Hernandez is currently in prison during his trial for the the June 2013 shooting death of Odin Lloyd, who was dating his fiancée's sister. Prosecutors contend that the three men, in the early hours of June 17, 2013, picked Lloyd up at his home in Boston and drove him to the industrial park where his body was found riddled with bullets later that day. During the trial, which began in January and featured more than 130 witnesses, prosecutors showed video footage of Hernandez coming and going from his home around the time of Lloyd's death. Investigators did not recover the gun that was used to shoot Lloyd, a.45-caliber Glock pistol. Hernandez faces a charge of murder and two firearms-related violations. If convicted of first-degree murder, he would be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. A second-degree murder conviction would lead to a life sentence with the possibility of parole after 15 years. Hernandez had been a rising star in the National Football League with a $41million contract when he was arrested on June 26, 2013. The Patriots dropped him within hours.

Article: Cedar Falls, Iowa (CNN)As aides politely tried to rush Ted Cruz from an event in Cedar Falls to one in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on Thursday, the presidential candidate continued shaking hands with anyone who wanted to meet him. Finally, after the selfies and conversations started to die down, his aides managed to move him closer to the door when a tall, burly man stopped him. "Senator," he said, "can I pray with you real quick?" "Yeah," Cruz said, as he clasped the man's upper arm and the two bowed their heads. It was one of the many moments when Cruz connected with voters on a religious level last week, as the senator from Texas hit the trail in Iowa for the first time as a presidential candidate. Being the only official contender in the race, Cruz drew large crowds during his two-day swing across the state. He's counting on Iowa, known for its vocal and active evangelical base, to propel him forward in what's expected to be a tough competition among a crowded field of GOP candidates. Cruz, himself, displays a pastoral swagger when he is speaking on stage and working a room. The senator regularly avoids using a podium, instead favoring pacing the stage with a wireless microphone, a scene reminiscent of a Sunday morning sermon. When he meets with people after events, he embraces each one's hand with both of his, softens his usually theatric tone and looks people square in the eye -- a familiar interaction between churchgoing Christians and their pastors. The past two winners of Iowa's caucuses rose to victory with support from the Christian right, and Cruz, who announced his bid last month at the well-known Baptist school Liberty University, is aiming to energize that same base and claim the coveted state as his prize. Evangelicals make up a large segment of Iowa's Republican voter bloc. According to a Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics poll from January, 44% of likely 2016 Republican caucus-goers said they were born-again or evangelical Christians. Cruz has built a brand as a stalwart conservative willing to buck GOP leadership on fiscal issues, but he showed in Iowa last week that he's also eager to champion social issues at a time when many Republicans are anxious to avoid them. He was one of the loudest defenders of the religious freedom law in Indiana, which came under fire last week for what critics called paving a path to discrimination against gays and lesbians. He described the outrage over the laws as "shameful" and an "assault" on First Amendment rights. "There are a lot of people here in Iowa and across the country whose hearts are breaking, watching what has happened in the last two weeks," Cruz said Friday night at an event in Des Moines. "We have seen a grossly unfair vilification of religious liberty." RELATED: Republican 2016 hopefuls back Indiana's'religious freedom' law. He's more than comfortable talking about his own faith and telling the story of how his father became a Christian and a pastor. Rafael Cruz, who's become a celebrity among Christian conservatives, will frequently visit Iowa over the next year, Cruz told voters. And Cruz's Iowa director, Bryan English, is a former pastor. Cruz's first television ads are appearing this weekend during programs on Fox News and NBC that are pegged to Easter Sunday. In the ad, Cruz talks about the impact of the "transformative love of Jesus Christ" on his life. While neither Mike Huckabee, who won Iowa in 2008, nor Rick Santorum, who won in 2012, went on to win the nomination, their successes helped launch them into high-profile battles with the then-front-runners. And with both of them likely running again in 2016, the competition will be stiff. That's why, for Cruz, courting evangelicals is only a component of a three-pronged strategy to win the nomination that also includes dominating the tea party faction and competing for the libertarian base. His stump speech hits on elements that appeal to each faction. He received standing ovations last week for calling to abolish the IRS, and, in a knock against the National Security Agency, he frequently tells audiences to leave their cell phones on so President Obama "can hear every word I have to say." Cruz argued Thursday that the Republican Party needs to bridge the gap between what he described as the Ron Paul-Rand Paul faction of the party -- young libertarian-minded voters -- and the Santorum base -- evangelicals. The two blocs, he said, are "not necessarily the best of chums." "If we're going to win, we've got to bring that coalition together," he said in Cedar Falls. "And I think we can do that." Cruz frequently says he wants to see a return of the evangelical vote to 2004 levels, when more than six in 10 evangelicals voted in the presidential election, a higher than normal turnout for the demographic. That number has waned slightly since 2004 -- but it's not too far off from the 56% of the overall population that voted in 2012. Still, his campaign believes that if it can tap into the group of evangelicals who've been staying home and get the demographic as a whole to overperform, then that could mean the difference of millions more at the polls. "If you look at available places for the party to expand the vote, it doesn't exist in the middle, it exists in the evangelical vote," said Rick Tyler, a top Cruz adviser. "It isn't a pond, it's an unfished ocean of available voters who are conservative." Russell Moore, president of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, said he expects to see record turnout among evangelicals in 2016 no matter who the nominee is or what that person says. Moore points to hot-button topics like religious freedom issues in the U.S., as well as increased attention to the killing of minority Christians in the Middle East and rising anti-Semitism. "I don't think a candidate is going to be able to get very far simply by using evangelical lingo or by pointing to his or her personal faith," Moore said. "I think a candidate is going to have to explain how he or she would protect religious liberty and would appoint justices and judges who will maintain the common good." Later in April, voters in Iowa will see the bulk of the GOP field tackle these issues when they take the stage at an event hosted by the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition. While the past two winners of the Iowa caucuses -- Santorum and Huckabee -- are likely running for president again, Steve Scheffler, president of the group, argued that the field is wide open in terms of who's going to win favor among evangelicals. Jeb Bush, while not popular among conservative activists, was known for his staunch anti-abortion record as Florida governor and touts his Catholic faith as a big force behind his policy views. Scott Walker is the son of a pastor. Ben Carson, the former neurosurgeon, rose to fame in conservative circles after criticizing the Obama administration at a national prayer breakfast. And other likely candidates -- from Marco Rubio to Rick Perry to Rand Paul -- have made serious efforts to court the religious right. "It's up for grabs. It's a clean slate regardless of if you've run before," Scheffler said. "Naturally those two (Huckabee and Santorum) have the name recognition and database of people who supported them in the past, but by and large voters are going to say, 'Let me take a good look at all of these candidates.'"

Article: Japan's J-League is just four games into a new season, but already the behaviour of its players is hitting the headlines for the wrong reasons after a player appeared to stamp on an opponent's face. Videos of the South Korean defender Kim Min Hyeok, who plays for Sagan Tosu, have gone viral after he allegedly brutally stamped on the face of opponent Mu Kanazaki. Sagan are ninth in the J-League and furious claims have been made that the 23-year-old deliberately committed the horrific foul after being jostled by 11th-placed Kashima Antlers player Kanazaki. Kim Min Hyeok (left) and Mu Kanazaki (right) fight it out for the ball on the wing during a J-League clash. After Kanazaki went down, it is alleged that Hyeok stamped down on the face of his fallen opponent. Despite the vicious looking nature of Hyeok’s apparent attack and Kanazaki’s dramatic clutch to his face, the defender only received a yellow card and was allowed to play on, much to the fans' uproar. Whether or not the foul was intentional, it is suspected that the reason for Japanese  fans’ outcry is not so much the act itself, but the fact that it was committed by a South Korean player. Hyeok's boot appears to scrape down Kanazaki's face, but the man on the floor came out as the winner later. Hyeok was somehow only shown a yellow card for the challenge that infuriated fans at the stadium. Some Japanese fans have demanded not only the expulsion of Hyeok, but of all South Koreans, from the game. However, regardless of the controversy, justice - to some extent - was served when the supposed stamped-on player’s team won 3-1, with Kanazaki among the goals.

Kim Min Hyeok has been accused of stamping on an opponent's face. Video footage appears to show Hyeok's foot scraping Mu Kanazaki's face. Kanazaki was among the goals in a 3-1 win for his Kashima Antlers side.

Article: Newcastle midfielder Rolando Aarons may have played his last game this season after suffering another injury setback. The 19-year-old was in contention to play for the club's under-21s against Derby on Wednesday evening along with fellow long-term absentee Siem de Jong. However, it is understood he has succumbed to injury once again and it is feared his campaign could be over. Newcastle midfielder Rolando Aarons has suffered another injury setback and may not play again this season. The 19-year-old was in contention to play for the Magpies' Under 21s against Derby on Wednesday. The Magpies declined to comment, but Aarons' loss would be yet another blow to head coach John Carver, who has seen his side defeated in each of its last five Barclays Premier League games amid a suspension and injury crisis which shows few signs of abating. Midfielder Moussa Sissoko was sent off during Monday night's loss at Liverpool to ensure his own enforced spell on the sidelines just as Carver prepares to welcome skipper Fabricio Coloccini back from a three-match ban. Carver can not call on striker Papiss Cisse, who has three more games to serve of his suspension, while Steven Taylor, Paul Dummett, Massadio Haidara, Cheick Tiote, Aarons and De Jong have all been missing for some time with most having kicked their last ball of the campaign. Newcastle had hoped Aarons' pace and direct approach would give them some fresh impetus with their season having careered to a halt in recent weeks. The exciting winger has made only five senior appearances to date this term, the last of them on November 1 when he was used as a first-half substitute in a 1-0 league win over Liverpool at St James' Park.Â. Newcastle midfielder Moussa Sissoko lunges in and makes a terrible tackle on Liverpool midfielder Lucas. Lucas goes down in pain after Sissoko's nasty challenge at Anfield on Monday night.

Article: Spanish police have killed a man in his 70s who barricaded himself into his home after shooting his daughter's boyfriend and a police officer last night. Following a night of failed negotiations, the shooter opened fire on the the armed police unit that stormed the house at 8am this morning. The man who has been named as Jose Luis by Spanish daily El Pais yelled 'enter if you have the balls' before an intense firefight ensued. Wounded: A Spanish man who shot and wounded his daughter's boyfriend (both pictured) and barricaded himself into his own home has been shot dead. He shot at the officers who raided the home in the north-eastern city of Zaragoza and seriously wounded one before they shot him dead. His daughter has been been pictured lying next to her injured partner outside the house in Ejea de los Caballeros. The 50-year-old man is in a serious condition at Hospital Clinico in Zaragoza after being shot twice in the shoulder with a shotgun, according to The Local. 15 minutes after the first attack, the now-dead shooter also shot a police officer who approached the house. A police spokesman has said said the man holed up in his own house for over 12 hours after shooting the two men who both needed medical treatment. An officer gave these details to el Periodico on the condition of anonymity because force regulations prevent him from being identified publicly. Forced entry: After a night of failed negotiations in Zaragoza, an elite police unit stormed the man's house this morning (pictured) and killed him. Agents tried to coax the man into leaving his home throughout the night without success - and had to return early this morning with armed officers. The Civil Guard finally decided to enter the house and confront the man who was shot dead when they slammed open the front door. Locals in the town, which has around 10,000 inhabitants, told El País that the man has three daughters and is usually 'calm' keeping himself to himself.

Article: (CNN)One hundred and forty-seven victims. Many more families affected. Even more broken hopes and dreams. As Kenyans mourned those killed last week in one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in the nation, citizens used social media to share the victims' stories, hopes and dreams. Using the hashtag #147notjustanumber -- a reference to the number of people, mostly students, killed at Garissa University College on Thursday -- Kenyans tweeted pictures of the victims in happier times. Kenyan authorities have not released a list of the victims. The posts provided heart-wrenching details on the victims, including one about an elderly man whose dreams died with his son. He had reportedly taken a loan to educate him at the university, where he was killed by Al-Shabaab terrorists. The attack in Kenya killed 142 students, three security officers and two university security personnel, and was the nation's deadliest since the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in 1998. Kenyan churches mourned the dead during Easter services Sunday as armed guards protected the congregations. In emotional services nationwide, churchgoers wept as they paid tribute to the victims of the massacre. The gunmen who attacked the university in the predawn hours separated Muslims from Christians and killed the latter. The extremist group has also killed Muslims in recent attacks. The Interior Ministry has identified one of the attackers killed by security forces as the son of a government official. The father of suspect Abdirahim Abdullahi is a chief in Mandera and had reported his son missing, officials said. The Islamist extremist group is based in Somalia, but it hasn't confined its terrorism to the nation that shares a border with Kenya. In 2013, militants attacked Nairobi's upscale Westgate Mall, killing nearly 70 people.

Article: If there’s one thing that stops a boiled egg from being the perfect food - it's the hassle of peeling it. More often than not the process will leave you with fragments of shell in your fingers, on the kitchen counter and sometimes even in your food. But one canny YouTube user, MicahMedia, has uploaded a video demonstrating the simplest and swiftest way to peel a hardboiled egg - using a glass of water. Scroll down for video. The hard-boiled egg is placed in a glass (left) before it is filled quarter of the way with tap water (right) He pops the hardboiled egg into a small tumbler glass before filling it a quarter of the way with water. He then places his hand over the top of the glass, completely covering it. His next move is to vigorously shake the glass from left to right. He keeps the glass in the sink so that the water doesn’t spill. After approximately ten seconds of shaking, the YouTuber lifts his hand to show the egg, which now has a cracked shell. He simply puts his hand in the glass and in a matter of miliseconds, lifts up the shell of the egg which has been loosened from the egg. The 28-second video which was uploaded in January this year currently has over 16million views on the video-sharing website. The egg is vigorously shaken from left to right so that the shell loosens. Result! Once the water has splashed out of the glass, simply peel lift the shell from the egg with no hassle. YouTube users have been praising MicahMedia for his ingenious solution to the age-old problem. ‘Well this has changed my morning. Good job, thanks,’ wrote Nikki Madison. Susan Wheeler wrote: ‘I have tried just about every method I have come across and been disappointed on the most part. This actually works wonderfully. I love doing it. Thanks!’ MicahMedia posted that he’s thinking of ‘doing six boiled eggs at once and seeing what happens.’

Article: Jose Mourinho insists Eden Hazard is in a one-horse race to scoop the player of the season award. The Chelsea forward has been outstanding this season and will be a leading contender to claim both the PFA and Football Writers' awards next month. The Belgian will face stiff competition, namely from Tottenham's Harry Kane, but Mourinho claims anyone who tips a player other than Hazard is merely making mischief. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho is backing his forward Eden Hazard (right) to win Player of the Year awards. Mourinho believes that 'it shouldn't even be a debate' that Hazard should claim the top prizes this season. Hazard has been in superb form for Chelsea this season and instrumental to their title charge. Mourinho insists that Hazard will be able to fend off competition from the likes of Spurs' Harry Kane (centre) 'It shouldn't even be a debate,' said Mourinho. 'If somebody throws other names on the table, it's because he wants to sell papers, get more clicks or throw some sand into people's eyes, because this player is by far the best player in the season.' Hazard is likely to feature at Queens Park Rangers on Saturday but Diego Costa will miss four weeks after aggravating a hamstring injury against Burnley last weekend. It means the striker will miss clashes with Manchester United and Arsenal. Mourinho is prepared to risk the availability of Cesc Fabregas and Nemanja Matic — both one booking away from a two-match ban — for the matches against Chelsea's rivals, saying: 'We try not to get a yellow card during the match, to play football. We know (the risks), but the game is a three-point game.' Meanwhile, Chelsea defender Wallace — on loan at Vitesse Arnhem — has been arrested on suspicion of an offence in a nightclub. The Dutch club refused to comment on the nature of the alleged offence, but a police spokesman was quoted by local media stating it was'sexual'. Wallace was later released without charge. Chelsea striker Diego Costa is set to be out of action for four weeks after aggravating a hamstring injury.

Article: (CNN)The California Public Utilities Commission on Thursday said it is ordering Pacific Gas & Electric Co. to pay a record $1.6 billion penalty for unsafe operation of its gas transmission system, including the pipeline rupture that killed eight people in San Bruno in September 2010. Most of the penalty amounts to forced spending on improving pipeline safety. Of the $1.6 billion, $850 million will go to "gas transmission pipeline safety infrastructure improvements," the commission said. Another $50 million will go toward "other remedies to enhance pipeline safety," according to the commission. "PG&E failed to uphold the public's trust," commission President Michael Picker said. "The CPUC failed to keep vigilant. Lives were lost. Numerous people were injured. Homes were destroyed. We must do everything we can to ensure that nothing like this happens again." The company's chief executive officer said in a written statement that PG&E is working to become the safest energy company in the United States. "Since the 2010 explosion of our natural gas transmission pipeline in San Bruno, we have worked hard to do the right thing for the victims, their families and the community of San Bruno," Tony Earley said. "We are deeply sorry for this tragic event, and we have dedicated ourselves to re-earning the trust of our customers and the communities we serve. The lessons of this tragic event will not be forgotten." On September 9, 2010, a section of PG&E pipeline exploded in San Bruno, killing eight people and injuring more than 50 others. The blast destroyed 37 homes. PG&E said it has paid more than $500 million in claims to the victims and victims' families in San Bruno, which is just south of San Francisco. The company also said it has already replaced more than 800 miles of pipe, installed new gas leak technology and implemented nine of 12 recommendations from the National Transportation Safety Board. According to its website, PG&E has 5.4 million electric customers and 4.3 million natural gas customers. The Los Angeles Times reported the previous record penalty was a $146 million penalty against Southern California Edison Company in 2008 for falsifying customer and worker safety data.

Article: Amir Khan believes Kell Brook has called him out so that he can have the 'one big payday' which has so far eluded him during his 10-and-a-half year career. Brook, who defeated Jo Jo Dan to retain his IBF welterweight title last month, immediately challenged Khan in a post-fight interview but the Bolton-born boxer has instead agreed a bout on May 30, with his opponent yet to be confirmed. Khan has reiterated his intention to take on Brook within the next 12 months, although he insists that the undefeated 28-year-old only wants the fight because of the money it will earn him. Amir Khan (left), pictured during his last fight against Devon Alexander, has blasted Kell Brook's motives. Brook (right) shakes hands with British Superbike champion Shane Byrne at Donington Park on Tuesday. In an interview with iFL TV, Khan said: 'He's only faced one decent opponent in his whole career, so he has no room to talk. It seems to me that he's just calling me out for that one big payday. 'If he keeps going on like this, that one big payday fight for him will never happen because at the end of the day, he's just trying to win fans over by mentioning my name when he knows that I can't fight then because of Ramadan. 'And he's putting down my opponents, who are still better opponents than his opponents, like Jo Jo Dan, who should be called No No Dan, to be honest with you, because end of day, he's not done anything in his career.' Khan had announced a fight with Chris Algieri next month but he has now backtracked on that, claiming that there are'some more options on the table'. Khan has now denied that he will face Chris Algieri next month, claiming there are'some more options' Chris Algieri lost every round to Manny Pacquiao when he took on the Filipino star last November. Brook is desperate to fight Khan but his fellow Brit rejected the chance to face him at Wembley in June. A £5million clash with Brook at Wembley on June 13 was also an option but Khan rejected the offer as he will not fight during Ramadan because of his Islamic faith. He added: 'Like I said, this Algieri fight, if it happens, it's making me a lot of money; money that Kell Brook's not seen. That's why he's probably dying. Amir's making millions when he's not even seen his first million. 'There's classes in boxing. There's fighters in boxing who are the A-class fighters, the likes of Manny Pacquiao and Mayweather, who talk about and mention and say they know who Amir Khan is. 'When it comes to Kell Brook, who knows Kell Brook in America? Which fighter, apart from Shawn Porter, knows Kell Brook? Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao don't know who Kell Brook is, so I don't know what he's going on about trying to say he's a big name. 'Kell Brook's going on like he's the next guy to fight Mayweather when he's not even a big ticket seller. He might be big in his own backyard in Sheffield, but other than Sheffield, no-one knows him. Brook is hoping to fight Khan within the next 12 months as he looks to extend his unbeaten streak. Khan claims that Brook is not even a big name in the UK and is not able to face the world's biggest names. 'The way he's tried to come across to the US public is like he's a super-big name in the UK. He's not a big name in the UK.' And Khan insists that he is not avoiding Brook, even though the fight will be of greater benefit to the Sheffield-born star. 'Look, do I need the fight against Kell Brook?,' said Khan. 'I make a lot of money regardless if I fight Kell Brook. 'I will make a lot of money in this sport and I've made a lot of money in this sport of boxing. Kell Brook needs me to make that big money. 'Without me, he'll never make that big money unless he goes out and fights the top guys like Pacquiao, Mayweather, and Marquez, but I can't see him fighting those guys because he's always scared to get beat by them and lose his title.'

Article: Boston (CNN)Guilty across the board. But will he face death? After deliberating for 11½ hours, jurors found Dzhokhar Tsarnaev guilty on Wednesday of all 30 counts he faced in the Boston Marathon bombing trial. Seventeen of the 30 counts were capital charges, meaning he is eligible for the death penalty. The trial will next move into a penalty phase, where the jury will hear testimony and arguments from both sides and ultimately be tasked with deciding whether Tsarnaev, 21, will be executed. A look at all of the charges. Jurors will be asked to weigh aggravating factors such as the heinousness of his crimes against mitigating factors such as his family and mental health history, as well as his relative youth. Tsarnaev was 19 at the time of the bombing. The start date of the penalty phase has not yet been set. Since testimony began March 4, federal prosecutors have called 92 witnesses, and the defense just four. It seemed a mismatch from the start. "He was there," Tsarnaev's defense attorney Judy Clarke conceded as the trial opened, but many say the defense strategy always had been to focus on persuading the jury to spare Tsarnaev's life. Tsarnaev lawyer keeps hated criminals off death row. Clarke tried to convince jurors that her client's older brother, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who died in a shootout with police days after the terror attack, was the instigator of the marathon plot. The younger man, Clarke said, was only following his older brother. After the verdict, CNN legal analyst Paul Callan said Clarke now faces an uphill battle. "Because No. 1, he (Tsarnaev) is almost functioning as an officer of a military organization attacking the United States -- the claim of course that he's an Islamic radical and that this is almost an army-like attack on civilians. "And the second thing -- it was so well planned and so callously planned so that civilians would die, so that children would be maimed. And all of this, she has to get around and convince the jury he's not worthy of the death penalty. "Boy, she's climbing the Mount Everest of death penalty cases in this case," Callan said about Clarke. Survivors react to the verdict. Ann O'Neill reported from Boston. Dana Ford reported from Atlanta.

Article: Chelsea goalkeeper Thibault Courtois insists he has not lost any sleep over his high-profile errors of recent weeks. The Belgian was exceptional for the Blues in their win over Queens Park Rangers on Sunday. It was a far cry from his displays in Chelsea's previous two matches, however. Thibaut Courtois (centre) was in phenomenal form as Chelsea beat rivals Queens Park Rangers on Sunday. Courtois (centre) has struggled in previous weeks and his error led to a  goal for Hull on March 22. Courtois cut a despondent man against Hull (left) but was back on form against QPR on Sundat. His poor touch allowed Abel Hernandez to score in Chelsea's 3-2 win over Hull on March 22 before Stoke's Charlie Adam beat him from 66 yards last weekend. But Courtois says his confidence levels have not waned as a result. 'I never doubted that I can't catch the ball. Against Hull, I just tried to make the best solution,' he said. 'It was not the best control, but in the second half I showed that I am mentally strong and I saved the team. 'Against Stoke, if you want to play high as a team, you as a goalkeeper have to play high as a team as well. Charlie Adam did a good strike and that can happen. 'But I showed against QPR that if you play high, you can go get the ball from the midfield. If I'm on the 16 yard box, I can go get it there. For me it's not a problem. Courtois has also faced criticism for failing to keep out Charlie Adam's 66-yard strike against Stoke. Courtois (right) said he never doubted himself during his indifferent spell of form for Chelsea. 'I continue. I never doubt myself. That's my strength. I helped the team with two good saves against QPR and I'm happy. 'The most important thing is the team and against Hull and Stoke we still won. 'I'm 22 and still learning. These were moments which I could learn from.'

Article: Most parents have the souvenir of a scan of their child in the womb at 12 weeks. The must-have for IVF mums and dads these days, however, is a video and pictures right from the moment of conception. The images are thanks to revolutionary technology that allows medics to record the microscopic miracle of life – from fertilisation to the division of cells, right through to the growth of an embryo. Hundreds of parents are now the proud owners of these EmbryoScope images, which are also helping scientists learn more about the IVF process. Scroll down for video. Pictured is the very first cell division of Pixie Morley, now aged nine months, taken using the revolutionary EmbryoScope technology. Sally and Stephen Morley (pictured with their daughter Pixie) are one of some 1,500 couples in Britain who have had babies using EmbryoScope technology. Sally and Stephen Morley are among them. The grainy grey and white picture on this page shows the first cell division in the creation of their IVF baby, Pixie. A tiny camera, placed inside an incubator, films the reproduction process. As well as allowing parents to watch back the moment the embryos form, the technology – developed in the US – also allows experts to select the best possible embryos based on how they form during the conception process. This narrows a mother’s chance of miscarrying. The Morleys, from Walsall, had spent months trying to have children naturally before opting for IVF. Mrs Morley, 38, the head of a nursery, said: ‘I knew time was against me being 36 when we started trying so when I failed to get pregnant each month I knew we should have fertility tests as soon as possible.’ While the couple were undergoing IVF, the EmbryoScope technology was introduced at the Midland Fertility Clinic, allowing them to be the first in their area to capture their child’s conception on camera. The technology allows medics and parents to watch the cell dividing. Pictured is the cell division of now nine-month-old Pixie. In October 2013, the embryo was transferred into Mrs Morley’s womb and within two weeks she was told by doctors that the process had been successful. Now, nine months after Pixie’s birth, she is still able to re-watch the moment her daughter was conceived. Experts have hailed the technology as one of the most important developments in IVF. Professor Simon Fishel, who is boss of Care Fertility, the first clinic in Britain to use the EmbryoScope, said: ‘We now know that embryos that do make babies and embryos that don’t make babies do different things. 'And to be able to see this in a time-matched movie and to be able to analyse it scientifically is absolutely wonderful science for us.’ Professor Fishel, who was part of the team that produced first test-tube baby, Louise Brown, in 1978, said the EmbryoScope was revealing the secrets about what happens to embryos as they develop – and why it is that around 70 per cent of them do not actually make babies. The videos were also an emotional milestone in the process of becoming a parent, Professor Fishel said. ‘The couple can see the process of fertilisation, see the cells divide, see the number of cells grow and see them produce an embryo…it is nothing short of observing the wonderful miracle of life.’ The video given to parents is a sped-up version of the process which occurs before the embryo develops. Professor Fishel said his patients were ‘awestruck’ when given the footage but that the clinic only gave parents the video once a mother had fallen pregnant. He added that, at across the Care Fertility clinics, 1,000 couples, who had gone on to have a baby, had been given footage of their embryo’s development.

New technology allows parents of IVF children to view babies' conception. It allows parents to see the embryo forming far before usual 12 week scan. Medics are able to watch process and select best embryo to be planted. Sally and Stephen Morley among 1,500 couples in UK to use technology.

Article: Ruby Walsh appears to jump his horse over a moving car in the latest promotional advert for betting firm Paddy Power. The 22-second clip shows the two-time Grand National winner galloping towards the speeding silver car and apparently jumping it as the bookmaker gears up for Saturday's big race at Aintree. Irish jockey Walsh, who is riding Ballycasey in the race, starts the clip by saying: 'This is how I've been getting ready for this year's Grand National.' The clip starts with champion jockey Ruby Walsh describing how he will prepare for the Grand National. The two-time National jockey appears to then leap over the speeding car on his horse. The horse clears the car, which Paddy Power say was travelling at 40mph, and lands. Walsh celebrates with a raised arm after completing the'stunt' Paddy Power claims he jumped straight over the car, which was said to be travelling at 40mph. The horse barely clears the car's roof before landing. Walsh stands upright and raises his right arm in apparent celebration after the horse lands and gallops away. It is not the first time the bookmaker has produced a controversial advert ahead of a major racing festival. In February 2012, a publicity stunt prior to the Cheltenham Festival featured a suited hitman firing tranquillizer darts at unsuspecting members of the public, promising to 'take care of the chavs - veterinary style.' It was inspired by loutish racegoers fighting at Ascot. Another advert released ahead of the 2012 Cheltenham Festival showed a clip of transgender racegoers and invited viewers to spot the'stallions' from the'mares.' Walsh pictured after riding Sempre Medici to victory on Irish Grand National Day at Fairyhouse last week. The Irish jockey will ride Ballycasey in Saturday's Grand National at Aintree. It was banned from television broadcast by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) after it received 92 complaints the ad was offensive and condoned and encouraged harmful discriminatory behaviour. Although banned from TV, both adverts remain easily accessible on the internet. Another advert ahead of the Ryder Cup last year saw UKIP leader Nigel Farage feature in a spoof political broadcast in which he was'swinging for Europe'. Walsh, 35, has twice won the Grand National before - on Papillon in 2000 and Hedgehunter in 2005.

Article: QPR are still two points and a seven-goal swing away from Premier League safety but in winger Matt Phillips they might just have the man to help them beat the drop. The Hoops winger has been in sensational form since the turn of the year and now sits second - behind only Barcelona's Lionel Messi - in the list of top assist makers in Europe's big five leagues in 2015. Phillips set up another two goals for Chris Ramsey's side in their 3-3 draw with Aston Villa on Tuesday night, taking his tally for 2015 - and the season - to seven. QPR's Matt Phillips (left) now has seven assists in 2015 - the second highest tally in Europe's top five leagues. Phillips also scored QPR's opening goal as Chris Ramsey's side drew 3-3 with Aston Villa on Tuesday. Barcelona star Lionel Messi has made more assists (eight) this year than any other player. Wolfsburg midfielder Kevin de Bruyne has 17 assists in the Bundesliga this season, with seven this year. That leaves the former Blackpool man just one behind Argentine superstar Messi, who has recorded eight assists this year to help Luis Enrique's side to the top of La Liga. Phillips, who also scored QPR's opening goal at Villa Park, is level with Wolfsburg playmaker Kevin de Bruyne when it comes to laying on goals for his team-mates. The ex-Chelsea midfielder has made an incredible 17 assists in the Bundesliga this season, with seven of those arriving since the turn of the year. Verona's Emil Halfredsson, who spent an unsuccessful two-year spell with Tottenham between 2005 and 2007, is one of six players to have laid on five goals in 2015.

Article: Ronny Deila has admitted Celtic will enter the Champions League qualifiers minus defender Jason Denayer. The SPFL young player of the month for March, 19-year-old Denayer is wanted back at parent club Manchester City for a pre-season assessment. Keen to pursue a first-team breakthrough after making his international debut for Belgium last month, doubts over the future of Manuel Pellegrini may yet hand the Parkhead the chance of a second loan deal. Jason Denayer (left) is wanted back by Manchester City for pre-season to be assessed by their staff. But Deila admits that won’t happen in time for the first Champions League qualifier on July 16. ‘City want Jason back for pre-season to see what kind of level he is at and where he stands and get the group together and maybe he will be loaned out again or he will stay. That is up to Jason and the manager,’ Deila explained. ‘We will see what happens - but it is very hard just now. We will look for a central defender anyway, one maybe two.’ Ronny Deila confirmed that the defender would be missing for the Champions League qualifers in July. Denayer remains non-committal on the prospect of an extended loan deal and added: ‘I only try to focus my mind on what is happening at Celtic and try to do my best for them. I always try to give my best level for Celtic, that’s what I need to do if I’m to reach the highest level in football. ‘I haven’t spoken to Patrick Vieira or anyone at City but I hope they are happy with my progress. ‘I feel that I have improved a lot from the start of the season, I’m a more mature player and my style of play is also different from when I first arrived. ‘Some of the strikers I come up against in Scotland are big and strong. They are big and a bit different to what I have been used to but I have improved with every game.’ Denayer has been an instant hit at the club and formed a formidable partnership with Virgil van Dijk.

Article: (CNN)Easter is unique on the Christian calendar, a major point in the cycle of the religious year, and one that has always been able to resist the commercialization and culture warring that surrounds Christmas. That's in part because Easter is genuinely about how religious impulses, and patterns, can operate in ways that affect our lives. Nevertheless, I'm often surprised by how little people, even those supposedly within the Christian tradition, actually know about what is called Holy Week and its culmination on Easter Sunday.   At a time when our culture is roiled by questions of identity and ethics (and tolerance) that have profound religious implications, it's worth pausing to explore this crucial holiday -- and the awareness of the human condition, in all its sadness and glory, that it engenders. After all, Holy Week calls mostly to those who incline their minds and hearts in its direction with seriousness of intent.  Still, the fuss must puzzle those looking on, wondering what it all means.  Why do Christians make so much of this springtime week, and make so much of Easter weekend? There is a phrase that many never come across, even among Christians:  Easter Triduum.  This refers to the three days of Easter that begin with Good Friday, proceed through Holy Saturday, and conclude with Easter Sunday.  It's definitely a progression, although the word itself -- triduum -- can refer to any three days of prayer. Easter Triduum has a kind of major prologue in Maundy Thursday, the day when, by tradition, Jesus celebrated the Last Supper with his disciples in the upper room in Jerusalem on the night before he was crucified.  The idea of Holy Communion begins with this meal, which was a Passover meal. Jesus, of course, was Jewish, as were all his disciples.  He was never trying to erase Judaism and found a new religion.  His work involved modifying and extending Judaism in fresh ways. On Maundy Thursday, Christians sometimes practice the washing of feet, recalling that Jesus washed the very dusty feet of his disciples at the Last Supper as a way of demonstrating profound humility -- showing that he was himself a servant -- and modeling a kind of ideal behavior. Good Friday isn't, in fact, so good.  It's the day of the crucifixion, when Jesus was scourged and beaten, forced to carry his cross to Golgotha, the "place of the skull," and nailed to the cross itself for what must have been an agonizing death.  The actual scene of the Crucifixion varies from gospel to gospel, as do his last words, assembled into the so-called "seven last words" of Jesus by adding up fragments from different gospels. Some of these words are quotations, as when Jesus asked God why he has abandoned him:  This is a quote from the 22nd Psalm, which opens:  "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"  Good Friday is a day of death, sacrifice, displacement, fear. Holy Saturday is probably the least understood day of the Easter Triduum.  It's a passageway between the darkness of the crucifixion and the bright hope of Easter.  This day occupies an anxious space in human experience, when the certain knowledge of something dreadful isn't quite erased -- can't be erased -- simply by hope.  It's a day of depression, a day of suspension. Then comes Easter, with the aura of the resurrection.  I'm always moved by the deep symbolism of this mythic moment, when the body of Christ becomes what is called a "glorified body."  This was not, as I've said elsewhere, the Great Resuscitation, although that's part of it, too.  Resurrection implies a total transformation, something beyond the physical realm. It's very important that almost nobody who encounters Jesus after the resurrection can really recognize him, know him, or understand him as the same person who was with them before he was crucified.  Easter embraces the great mystery of resurrection, with its promise of transformation -- a shift from one form to another, and a change that moves well beyond any literal understanding. The three days of Easter, the Triduum, occur only once a year on the calendar.  But the really interesting thing is that we all experience the pattern of the three days again and again.  We find ourselves emptied out in small ways, nailed to our own trees in life, embarrassed or broken by life. It was the Buddha who famously observed that life is suffering.  Good Friday embodies the Christian version of that truth.  Jesus suffered in the way all of us must suffer.  We must all die, perhaps less ignominiously but just as certainly.  Our friends and families must die.  We all experience illness, loss, sadness, a loss of confidence, darkness.  This is simply part of the human experience. We dive again and again into Holy Saturday, too -- a period of transition, when the bleakness of suffering is perhaps slightly behind us but nothing restorative seems in view.  We know well this in-between time; it's an anxious passage, with only a glimmer on the horizon of potential hope. And we've all been resurrected, again and again, perhaps in tiny ways.  This is the joy of Easter, and it's not something reserved for one day on the calendar.  It's there whenever we experience what T.S. Eliot once called the "timeless moment," which can only occur -- paradoxically -- in time itself.  It's a mystical point where timelessness intersects with time. I suspect we all experience the Triduum frequently, sometimes more than once in a single day.  But the ritual enactment of these three days of the Easter season reminds all of those who practice Christianity -- and perhaps those who don't -- that we should expect to move through darkness into light. It's a pattern that describes a kind of spiritual progression.   It's good cause for celebration, too:  and one that won't easily be co-opted by secular culture.

Article: Brendan Rodgers has insisted that Raheem Sterling will not be sold this summer, even if he fails to agree a new long-term contract at Anfield. But as we've seen in the past - with Luis Suarez's move to Barcelona a prime example - that sort of promise isn't always kept. Here, Sportsmail takes a look at five possible destinations for the England man. Raheem Sterling, pictured in training on Thursday, has attracted interest from a number of big clubs. ARSENAL. The Gunners have a genuine interest in the Liverpool wonderkid and believe they have the financial capabilities to pull off a mega-deal. But when push comes to shove, can they emerge victorious in what could turn out to be an auction? Sterling has rejected a contract worth £100,000-a-week and could look to force a move away from Liverpool. CHELSEA. The big question is how would Sterling fit into Jose Mourinho's plans given his wealth of attacking talent. But when the best players become available, the best clubs are always in the market. It is no different with the Blues. London will also be a major pull for Sterling. MANCHESTER CITY. City are always in the market for the best British talent as they try to keep up with homegrown quota regulations. Sterling will, perhaps, be the best available British player in the market this summer. Expect City to make their move early in the transfer window. Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has insisted that the club will not sell Sterling this summer. MANCHESTER UNITED. Would Sterling do it? Would Liverpool sell to United? It would certainly a bold move should he join Liverpool's fiercest rivals. They certainly have the finances to make a deal happen. United are looking for superstars this summer. This would be a super transfer. BAYERN MUNICH. Pep Guardiola is understood to be a big fan of the 20-year-old. But would Sterling be up for playing abroad at such an early stage of his career? If he is, then expect Bayern to be in the running for his signature this summer. Bayern Munich boss Pep Guardiola is believed to be keen on Sterling and could make a move for him.

Article: He was once the most fearsome competitor in all of sport, infamous for his prickly nature towards rivals and single-minded pursuit of victory. But the Tiger Woods who has turned up to Augusta National this year is different. Very different. Earlier this week we were treated to the sight of Woods embracing Darren Clarke on the practice ground. Europe's Ryder Cup captain is an old pal of Tiger's so that was unusual, but understandable. So too was the sight of him sharing a hearty laugh with his old mucker, Mark O'Meara. But dancing? Yes, Tiger Woods dancing. Forget unusual, that is almost alarming. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO OF TIGER WOODS DANCING WHILE PRACTISING. Tiger Woods was spotted dancing while he practised on Monday at Augusta National. The former world No 1 had headphones in both ears as he listened to music while honing his game. A video has emerged of the former world No 1, with headphones in each ear, bopping away while he honed his wedge game on the practice ground on Monday. No prizes for the first person to ask: 'was he listening to Tiger Feet?' Augusta's patrons were treated to another glimpse of the new, cuddly Tiger on Wednesday morning as he enjoyed another manly hug with veteran Spaniard Miguel Angel Jimenez. Woods shared a warm greeting with Miguel Angel Jimenez on Wednesday morning. The 14-time major champion embraced the veteran Spaniard on the practice ground at Augusta. Jimenez watches on as Woods hits a drive during the build-up to the Masters. Perhaps the 50-year-old was offering Woods some tips on how to play the course, having finished fourth last year. Woods may be a four-time Masters champion but he has not played competitively since the first week in February and has battled through a bout of the chipping yips. Maybe the tunes have helped to release some of the tension in his short game. Woods will also play in the traditional Masters warm-up, the Par-3 Contest, for the first time in 11 years on Wednesday. The 39-year-old will be joined by his daughter, Sam, 7, and his son, Charlie, 6, for the event, which is a light-hearted affair for the players and their families. Woods and former champion Ben Crenshaw compare putters on the 13th green during a practice round. Woods is watched by his coach, Chris Como, as he hits on the driving range on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Australia's Marc Leishman has withdrawn from the Masters due to personal reasons. Leishman's wife Audrey was taken ill with an apparent case of pneumonia last week and put into an induced coma in hospital. 'It is with both deep regret and incredible relief I am withdrawing from the Masters tournament this week,' Leishman said in a statement. 'My wife Audrey has survived a life threatening medical emergency and I have decided to remain by her side with our children. 'Thanks to an incredible team of doctors and nurses Audrey appears to be on the road to a full recovery. Our two young children remain blessed to have the world's best mum in their lives. I want to pass along our thanks to all who supported us through this difficult period. 'We ask that you keep Audrey in your thoughts and prayers and I wish my best to all of the competitors for a great 2015 Masters.' Leishman finished joint fourth at Augusta when fellow Australian Adam Scott won the Masters in 2013. He had been due to tee off at 4:03pm BST on Thursday alongside former champion Ian Woosnam and Erik Compton. His withdrawal brings the field down to 97 players.

Article: Mario Balotelli hit back at those criticising his absence for Liverpool's FA Cup quarter-final win over Blackburn Rovers due to illness by attempting to prove he had a high temperature. Robbie Savage branded Balotelli 'pathetic' for missing the game, four days after he withdrew himself from the Liverpool squad  for their trip to Arsenal following a'slight knock' suffered in training. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers revealed the £16million striker travelled with the squad to Blackburn, but that he felt too ill to take part after staying over in the hotel with his team-mates. Mario Balotelli responded to Robbie Savage's labelling of the Liverpool striker as 'pathetic' Balotelli was not included in the Liverpool squad to face Arsenal or Blackburn Rovers this week. Brendan Rodgers revealed Balotelli withdrew himself from the squad on Saturday and fell ill on Wednesday. Liverpool scraped through to a Wembley date with Aston Villa in the FA Cup semi-finals thanks to Philippe Coutinho's strike. With 20 minutes remaining at Ewood Park, the Brazilian fired the ball across goal and past Rovers keeper Simon Eastwood. Click here to read Ian Ladyman's report. BT Sport pundit and former Blackburn midfielder Savage said: 'Pathetic isn't it? You're going to miss an FA Cup quarter-final? 'I don't know how unwell he is, but to miss an FA Cup quarter-final when you're feeling a bit ill? Nonsense. I would have to be really, really ill to miss that game.' Balotelli responded by posting a photograph of himself on Instagram, holding a thermometer reading 38.7 Celsius — 1.7C above 'normal' body temperature. Philippe Coutinho fires home the winner to send Liverpool into the FA Cup semi-final against Reading. Coutinho celebrates with his team-mates as Liverpool keep their dreams of winning a trophy alive. Mario Balotelli reported a temperature of 38.7C (101.66F) which is indeed above the normal body temperature of 37C (99.5F). The Liverpool striker may also have felt hot, sweaty, thirsty, very uncomfortable and slightly hungry. He may also have felt tired. Should body temperature reach 40C (104F), the person will be dehydrated and may suffer from vomiting and dizziness. With the snap, Balotelli wrote: 'Nothing stop me to watch my team winning. At least this time you know the real reason I am out. Miss the pitch so much #unluckyseason #YNWA #illbeback [sic].' Rodgers planned to use Balotelli for the FA Cup tie, but  admitted it was at the final moment his misfiring striker became unavailable. 'Mario travelled with us. He trained well, [but] fell ill last night,' Rodgers said ahead of the match which ended 1-0 to Liverpool. 'He stayed overnight with us in the hotel, [but] woke up still not feeling great. The doctors' advice was to send him back.' Balotelli's absence follows the Italian missing last Saturday's 4-1 defeat by Arsenal. The striker did not travel to the Emirates for the crunch clash after sustaining a hamstring injury in training on Friday. Rodgers said at the time: 'He trained on Friday afternoon with the team and he took a slight knock to his knee and he deemed himself not able to travel. 'I'm not a medic. He felt it was too sore to travel. The medical staff have looked at it. It was just something that he himself didn't feel comfortable enough to travel.' But Balotelli was reportedly later spotted with a group of friends at a private table at Manchester nightclub One Central Street. BT Sport pundit Savage feels it shows Balotelli's lack of determination to be absent for the FA Cup tie.

Article: (CNN)Police in India are putting aside their batons in favor of an overhead solution to angry and unruly crowds: pepper-spraying drones. Yashasvi Yadav, Senior Superintendent of police in Lucknow, northern India, told CNN the city's force has bought four drones and is in the process of purchasing one more. "The drones have been tested in controlled conditions," he said. "They have been very successful and will be used by the Lucknow police whenever there are violent protests or mob attacks." The miniature aircraft will be fitted with a camera and pepper spray; each drone costs between $9,560 and $19,300, Yadav added. Views on the new measure are mixed, with some concerned about the suppression of freedom of speech -- an already contentious issue in India. Last month, the country failed to enforce a law that would allow authorities to arrest people who post offensive material on social media. Others believe the country could learn from events further afield. Some say this method of crowd control needs regulation too. Questions have also been raised as to why the police are resorting to aggression. "While I think it is bound to fail if not be another scam in the making, it also shows the mindset of the administration to not use dialogue and mediation to solve problems but use authoritarian and forceful methods," photojournalist Chirag Wakaskar in Mumbai told CNN. "What they could do is start by having video surveillance in sensitive areas and have swifter justice." Protests are a common occurrence in India, a country with a population of 1.2 billion; Lucknow, the capital of the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, also used drone cameras to monitor crowds at a recent religious festival. As well as being used as a security measure in other cities including Delhi and Mumbai, the unmanned, airborne vehicles have been used in tiger hunts, disaster relief and criminal investigations -- and even pizza deliveries. Reports suggest that the drone surveillance will be officially launched by the Chief Minister of Lucknow, Akhilesh Yadav, later this month. Kunal Sehgal contributed to this report.

Article: Gareth Bale drives an unstoppable left-footed bullet in at the far post during a routine training drill as Real Madrid train on Wednesday. It's powerful, poised and emphatic, though far from a winner at the Nou Camp, but it's all the Welshman can do for now as he returns from international duty to a less than appreciative fan base. Bale joined Cristiano Ronaldo and Co for their second day back at training as they prepared for their first match back after the devastating loss to Barcelona that saw them fall four points behind the La Liga leaders. Gareth Bale chests down a cross from the right before unleashing a bullet in Real Madrid training. Perfectly balanced, Bale cocks his powerful left leg to hit his shot on the half-volley. Having hit the ball sweetly it rockets into the net at the far post giving the keeper no chance. The under fire winger returns to Madrid on the back of a vital double for Wales against Israel as they claimed top spot in Euro 2016 qualifying's group B. Showing no signs of the drama he's been subject to in Spain, including an attack on his white Bentley by a so-called fan, Bale scored his 15th and 16th goals for his country. His first came from a curling free-kick over the wall before his second, a strong finish after arriving late into the area, marked his 20th for the season in all competitions.

He's done a great job since he arrived at the club and I don't understand this witch hunt against him',' he said on Neox TV's El Chiringuito. The defender had similar words for Ronaldo, who has also faced hash criticism of late. 'They've been very unfair with him. Nobody can doubt his professionalism. He has every right to think they've been unfair to him. You cannot be as good as Cristiano unless you are very demanding with yourself, or the first player in training, or you look after yourself at home.'

Article: (CNN)Just as the agency begins to recover from a series of high-profile missteps, the Secret Service is facing yet another scandal. A female employee accused Xavier Morales, a supervisor within the agency, of assault after he made sexual advances at  her, according to The Washington Post. "The woman told police and agency investigators that Morales, her boss, told her during the party at Capitol City Brewing Company that he was in love with her and would like to have sex with her," and later tried to kiss her in the office, according to a report from The Washington Post. During the incident, he "grabbed her arms when she resisted" and the two tussled until Morales gave up, sources told the paper. The Post reports that the March 31 party was in celebration of Morales' new assignment as head of the Louisville field office. A Secret Service spokesperson confirms that  Morales was placed on administrative leave and his security clearance was suspended. This incident was first reported on April 2, and Secret Service Director Joe Clancy was briefed that afternoon. Clancy called the allegations "very disturbing." "Any threats or violence that endangers our employees in  the workplace is unacceptable and will not be tolerated," he said in a statement. This is just the latest chapter for an organization embroiled in scandal over the past several months. Last month, two top-ranking officials were suspended following an incident at a White House command post during an investigation of a possible bomb. Clancy was not made aware of the episode until five days later. The agency has also faced scrutiny for another lapse in late January when a drone crash-landed on the White House lawn. Secret Service Director Julia Pierson resigned in September after a fence-jumper gained access to the East Room of the White House. Earlier in September, an armed security contractor was allowed to get into an elevator with President Barack Obama during a trip to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. An independent report released in December found that the Secret Service is stretched "beyond its limits," needing more training, more staff, and a director from outside its ranks. Clancy, who formally assumed the post in February, is a 27-year veteran of the agency. "It's going to take time to change some of this culture," Clancy said at a House Appropriations Committee hearing last month. "There's no excuse for this information not to come up the chain. That's going to take time because I'm going to have to build trust with our workforce." The incident will be further investigated by the Office of the Inspector General.

Article: This is the moment a football coach who claimed thousands in disability benefits after he said he could barely walk was caught putting up goalposts. Benefits cheat Ian Drinnan claimed his arthritis caused him almost constant pain and meant he had to use crutches to get around. But the 58-year-old was filmed looking sprightly in his role at Blackpool Rangers FC where he helped to put up spectator barriers and goalposts. This is the moment benefits cheat Ian Drinnan was caught on film putting up goalposts at his local club. Blackpool magistrates heard that Drinnan was claiming £3,500 in disability benefits and had told the Department of Work and Pensions he did not have any hobbies and was in pain six days a week. He also said he could only walk for two or three minutes at a slow pace, could not bend and needed to use crutches because of the pain in his legs which meant he frequently fell. But Prosecutor Pam Smith said: 'He was watched and was on his feet for three or four hours at a time. He was not using crutches.'

Article: In the search for meaning and importance, the FA Cup might have found its saviour. Enter Liverpool and Brendan Rodgers, a club and manager not just popping into the party to say a polite hello and a quick goodbye. Tonight, against Blackburn at Ewood Park, Rodgers faces one of those defining moments in a season that has not lacked them. His only hope must be that this time it doesn't go so horribly wrong. So far it has been a theme of the campaign that when the need was greatest, so too have been the disappointments. He loaded for duck on a bear hunt in the Champions League against Real Madrid and lost. He wanted to save his best resources for Chelsea and lost that game, too. Kolo Toure found the net in Liverpool's FA Cup clash with Blackburn but his effort was ruled out. Blackburn salute their fans at Anfield after earning a Sixth Round replay at home to the Premier League side. When the European portion of their season fizzled out, first in the big show and then in the Europa League, the Premier League offered an opportunity. Getting into the top-four without Luis Suarez and often in the absence of Daniel Sturridge would be an immense achievement. Having started the season so badly and recovered so impressively, it became a real possibility. Then two huge games - Manchester United and Arsenal. A chance. Steven Gerrard lost his mind, the defence lost the plot and Liverpool lost by a combined total of 6-2 across the two games. A top-four place is virtually gone, unless anyone can conceivably see them making up seven points and a massive goal difference on Manchester City. Suddenly, the romance of the FA Cup is a little more two-sided. They need it badly. Steven Gerrard's birthday falls on May 30, the same day as the FA Cup final at Wembley. The FA Cup represents Liverpool's last chance of silverware after a disappointing season. 'I don't want to go down the route of saying that it saves our season,' said Rodgers before the replay of their quarter-final against Blackburn. 'Our objective at the start, though, was to win a trophy. 'So I think if we didn't get in the top four and we didn't have a trophy this year, we would be disappointed. I think certainly the FA Cup would give us a great boost as a team with lots of young players and players coming into the club. 'That's the expectancy we want. We want to be able to be challenging every year. 'That was the key thing for me, to get the group challenging at the top end of the league and for trophies. The FA Cup would mark a good step forward for us.' The need for trophies has been a dominant theme since Rodgers took over at Liverpool and made them contenders again. There is no denying the steps he has taken with the club and very little to suggest he is anything other than one of the sharpest managerial minds working in this country. Daniel Sturridge will be crucial to Liverpool's chances of reaching the FA Cup semi-final. Glen Johnson is in good spirits in training ahead of Liverpool's trip to Ewood Park on Wednesday. But how he will be tested if this season ends without either a top-four place or a trophy. Raheem Sterling rather helpfully alluded to the need for the latter recently. That tricky contract situation has not gone away and it is less likely to have a happy ending for Liverpool if they can't present a silver argument to Sterling in the summer. The same goes for potential new arrivals. Rodgers can talk magnificently and persuasively but his sales pitches to leading players would be enhanced immeasurably if he could talk about current achievements. Something shiny and tangible and recently acquired would help. It's a tough ask. They face Blackburn with a defence looking as woefully shaky as it did at the start of the season. Without Martin Skrtel and Emre Can tonight that defence could be vulnerable again. Steven Gerrard is also missing. Not ideal, though not necessarily a tremendous setback against a Championship side. In any case, Liverpool and Rodgers need to find a way through. It has been three years since they last won a trophy – under Kenny Dalglish - and the FA Cup is a chance to stop the clock. It's a defining moment that must not end in another failure. Liverpool have not won a trophy since they beat Cardiff to win the Carling Cup three years ago. Real Madrid 1-0 Liverpool, November 4. Finally back on the grandest stage, but Rodgers opted for a watered down XI. Dejan Lovren, Steven Gerrard, Raheem Stirling, Jordan Henderson, Philippe Coutinho and Mario Balotelli played all previous Champions League matches but none of them started. The aim, it appeared, was to prioritise the following league game. Karim Benzema celebrates scoring for Real Madrid against Liverpool at the Bernabeu. Liverpool 1-2 Chelsea, November 8. It was time to vindicate the gamble in Madrid, which was widely criticised. Rodgers made seven changes to the side that lost in the Champions League and Emre Can put them ahead. But Chelsea won 2-1, leaving Liverpool eighth in the Premier League. Having rested a host of players in Madrid, Brendan Rodgers' side then lost a crunch league game to Chelsea. Chelsea 1-0 Liverpool, January 27. After drawing the first leg of their Capital One Cup semi-final, Liverpool blew a host of chances and fell to a stoppage-time winner. A big opportunity missed. The Stamford Bridge also knocked Liverpool out of the Capital One Cup following a 1-0 win at home. Besiktas 1-0 Liverpool, February 26. Ten years after their Champions League miracle in Istanbul, Liverpool returned to face Besiktas in the Europa League last 32. They held a 1-0 first-leg lead. It went horribly wrong and they lost on penalties. 'Unfortunately, on this occasion, Istanbul is not a happy place,' said Rodgers. Demba Ba celebrates after Dejan Lovren missed the crucial penalty in the shoot-out against Besiktas. Arsenal 4-1 Liverpool, April 4. Liverpool's last real shot at getting into the top four and it fell apart spectacularly. Raheem Sterling's unauthorised interview hardly helped matters in the build-up and the game was a disaster. They were 3-0 down at half-time and ultimately repeated the kind of defensive inadequacies that hurt them earlier in the campaign. A huge anti-climax. Mesut Ozil curls home Arsenal's second in their 4-1 win over Liverpool in the Premier League last weekend.

Liverpool take on Blackburn in their FA Cup Sixth Round replay tonight. The competition represents the Anfield club's last chance of success.

Article: Marseille, France (CNN)Investigators have collected all the main evidence from the site where Germanwings Flight 9525 crashed, a French national police official told CNN on Saturday. Investigators are not expected to return to the crash site, said Capt. Yves Naffrechoux of the High Mountain Gendarmerie. The plane crashed March 24 in rugged terrain of the Alps about 6 miles (10 kilometers) from the town of Seyne-les-Alpes. "All the police investigators have left the (Germanwings) crash site," he said. "There is only a private security company ensuring security around the crash site so that no one can go there." The security firm will guard the site until the remaining debris is collected and taken to secure locations for further analysis, if necessary, he said. The flight data recorder, or "black box," was found Thursday by a member of the recovery team. The cockpit voice recorder was found days after the crash. In addition, out of more than 2,000 DNA samples collected from the crash site, lab workers have isolated 150 DNA profiles, said Brice Robin, Marseilles prosecutor. The crash killed all 150 people on board. Brice Robin, Marseilles prosecutor, said authorities have found 470 personnel effects at the site. That number includes 40 cell phones, though all those were badly damaged. Robin cast doubt that any useful information could be retrieved from those phones, given their condition. Authorities say the flight's co-pilot, Andreas Lubitz, locked the captain out of the cockpit and engineered the plane's demise. Initial tests on the flight data recorder show that Lubitz purposely used the controls to speed up the plane's descent, according to the French air accident investigation agency, the BEA. It also has emerged that Lubitz had battled depression years before he took the controls of Flight 9525 and that he had concealed from his employer recent medical leave notes saying he was unfit for work.

Article: Andy Murray’s coach has announced she is pregnant – two days before the British tennis star’s wedding to Kim Sears. Former world No 1 Amelie Mauresmo is expecting her baby in August, and will be heavily pregnant as she guides Murray through Wimbledon. The openly gay 35-year-old broke the news on social media on Thursday night. Amelie Mauresmo was appointed as Andy Murray's coach last summer. Mauresmo revealed on Twitter: ‘Baby will be here in august! #pregnant So happy.’ Murray, 27, marries long-time fiancee Kim Sears at Dunblane Cathedral on Saturday and the news is likely to overshadow their preparations. Mauresmo, who won Wimbledon and the Australian Open titles in 2006, came out as gay at the 1999 Australian Open. Mauresmo roars on Murray during his Australian Open quarter-final clash with Nick Kyrgios in January. Thursday’s Tweet was accompanied by a photo of a pair of baby-sized blue All Star trainers next to a pair of adult shoes. Mauresmo was appointed as Murray’s coach in June 2014 following his split from Ivan Lendl three months earlier. Much of the initial debate around Mauresmo’s appointment centred on whether she could instil a more aggressive attitude in Murray. But it also focused on whether he could rediscover the self-control that became so evident under Lendl. Mauresmo,  a former world number one,  won Wimbledon and Australian Open singles titles back in 2006. Mauresmo celebrates beating Justine Henin-Hardenne to win Wimbledon in 2006. Mauresmo also won the Australian Open in 2006. Away from the court, on which he is ferociously competitive, Murray is said to be thoughtful, with a gentle and sensitive side, similar to softly spoken Mauresmo. He was forced to defend her appointment, saying: ‘She was someone who struggled with nerves and conquered them later in her career. Someone like that can help more than someone who hasn’t had those issues before. ‘You can talk about Amelie’s accomplishments, she won a lot. She was No 1 in the world, she won multiple Grand Slams, she had a creative game style. As a person, she is very nice, very easy to communicate with, but she is firm as well. So those are the reasons I wanted to give it a shot.’ Murray insisted his coaching liaison with Mauresmo was long-term after he surrendered his Wimbledon crown last summer.

Article: The French rugby federation is looking for candidates to replace France coach Philippe Saint-Andre following the World Cup. Since taking over from Marc Lievremont, who led France to the World Cup final in 2011, Saint-Andre has failed to impose himself, winning only 15 of his 37 games in charge. He has overseen poor results in the Six Nations, finishing no higher than fourth and even last in 2013. Philippe Saint-Andre (right) arrives for training in Marcoussis with Louis Picamoles (left) and Nicolas Mas. Saint-Andre has struggled as head coach of Les Bleus winning just 15 of his 37 games in charge. Saint-Andre will remain in charge for the World Cup in England from September 18 to October 31. The FFR launched the application process to find his replacement on Friday, with candidates having until April 25 to declare their bid. Among the favorites to land the job are Begles-Bordeaux coach Rapahael Ibanez, former Montpellier manager Fabien Galthie and long-time Toulouse coach Guy Noves. Saint-Andre succeeded Marc Lievremont (above) following the 2011 World Cup in New Zealand.

Article: (CNN)Pardon us, "Lost" fans, but April 8 wasn't only your day. Yes, we know the significance of April 8, 2015, and the alignment of 4:23.42 p.m. on that date to everyone obsessed with the hit ABC show, and we heard about the general geek-outs that were occurring. But don't forget, April 8 was also "Rex Manning Day." Twitter didn't, paying homage to the 1995 film "Empire Records" and the character of Rex Manning, played by the very dreamy Maxwell Caulfield. The movie -- also starring Liv Tyler, Anthony LaPaglia and Renée Zellweger -- centers on an independent record store in Delaware where, on April 8, former pop idol Manning is scheduled to make an in-store appearance. Fret not if you missed it, as we have some other dates made famous by films that you aren't going to want to let pass you by:. April 14. Their love affair was doomed like two ships passing in the night, but it was so good while it lasted for Jack and Rose in the 1997 blockbuster movie "Titanic." The sketch Jack does of his beloved is dated April 14, 1912. The Titanic sank on April 15, 1912. April 25. Thanks to the 2000 film "Miss Congeniality," we now know that April 25 is the perfect date. Just don't forget to dress accordingly. October 3. "Mean Girls Day" is officially October 3, given that's when Aaron Samuels (OMG, he is so hot!) asks Cady what day it is. Of course, she replies "It's October 3." Honestly, any day is a good day to quote the 2004 film. It's so fetch. October 21, 2015. Buckle up for this one. In the 1989 film "Back to the Future Part II," Marty McFly and the gang travel to October 21, 2015. We hope to be celebrating that in our flying car that we are STILL waiting on, please and thank you.

Article: Barcelona's Brazilian star Neymar was left fuming after being substituted by Luis Enrique during the 2-2 draw at Sevilla on Saturday night, according to reports in Spain. Neymar, who scored his side's second goal with a curling free kick, was replaced with the score at 2-1 and 15 minutes to play. Sevilla then scored a late equaliser, and Neymar 'can't understand why he is subbed so much' reports Spanish paper Sport. Neymar's dispute with Luis Enrique features prominently in Spain, while they look ahead to the Madrid derby. The paper points out that the forward has been replaced in 15 of his 34 matches this season, with only Ivan Rakitic and Andres Iniesta being substituted more. With Barcelona still top of La Liga, and challenging for a treble, the paper points out that the club will need to be united in the final run-in. Elsewhere in Spain the attention is focused on the Madrid derby in this week's Champions League quarter-finals. Marca claims that the game is 'like a final', with the two teams playing out a repeat of last year's showdown in Lisbon, while in AS, Real defender Pepe calls for intensity and humility. In Italy the headlines are dominated by Lazio, who moved above their city rivals Roma into second place in Serie A with a win over Empoli. AS also look ahead to the Champions League quarter-final, while in Italy the focus is on Lazio's win.

Article: Ferrari, who are Ferrari? Lewis Hamilton sauntered to pole position for the Malaysian Grand Prix, nearly one second ahead of Sebastian Vettel’s third-fastest Ferrari. That said, Ferrari are stronger over a long run and may yet provide a threat to Hamilton’s supremacy. Hamilton was four-hundredths of a second ahead of his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg – ‘the blink of an eyelid’, as he, the German described it. Rosberg will start second. Lewis Hamilton waves to the crowd after claiming pole for the Chinese Grand Prix. He will start ahead of Nico Rosberg and Sebastian Vettel. Vettel, who won last time out in Malaysia, shakes hands with his countryman Rosberg as Hamilton celebrates his third pole on the spin. Hamilton stands on top of his Mercedes after he held off the challenge from his team-mate Rosberg to take pole. Lewis Hamilton salutes the crowd after claiming pole for the Chinese Grand Prix. 1.

'Come on, guys,' he moaned over the team radio after he was informed he'd missed out on pole. Hamilton was relaxed. Vettel was downcast, but said that the race may be a different story from qualifying. Hamilton set his fastest time on his penultimate lap. It was enough. Rosberg, though, got closer to Hamilton than he has recently, perhaps heeding the advice of Niki Lauda, his team chairman, who told him via Sportsmail to ‘sort himself out’. McLaren will be towards the back of the grid. Jenson Button will start 17th and Fernando Alonso 18th. Barely a hair’s breadth separated the two former champions. A naturally disappointed Button said: 'The car didn't feel bad so it's interesting when you find a good balance but the lap time is not there. We've made good improvements this weekend, but qualifying just wasn't for us. 'Hopefully we'll be racing the cars in front tomorrow, but we hoped to be competing with them in qualifying as well.' Sebastian Vettel qualified third but could threaten Hamilton's supremacy with the Ferrari stronger than Mercedes over a long run. Rosberg waves to the crowd after qualifying on the front row, but the German was clearly frustrated to have missed out on pole position. Hamilton's impressive lap on his first run on Q3 was enough to claim his third successive pole at the Chinese Grand Prix. Vettel starts ahead of Williams pair Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas, with Ferrari team-mate Kimi Raikkonen down in sixth place as he struggled in Q3, with his best lap in Q2. Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was seventh quickest ahead of the Lotus of Romain Grosjean, with Sauber pair Felipe Nasr and Marcus Ericsson performing superbly to claim ninth and 10th. Pastor Maldonado lines up 11th, missing out on a place in the top 10 by seven thousandths of a second, with Daniil Kvyat a surprisingly lowly and disappointing 12th in his Red Bull. Jenson Button out-qualified Fernando Alonso for the second consecutive race, but will only start 17th for McLaren. Fernando Alonso starts 18th in Shanghai and will have the Manor cars of Will Stevens and Roberto Merhi for company at the back of the grid. Toro Rosso rookies Max Verstappen and Carlos Sainz Jr start 13th and 14th, with Sergio Perez 15th in a Force India that is off the pace as the team's financial issues means they will not have their new car on the grid until June. From the initial 18-minute session, Force India's Nico Hulkenberg led the list of departees, finishing three tenths of a second behind team -mate Perez. For the first time this season Manor had both cars taking part in qualifying, with both also comfortably finishing within the 107 per cent rule. Will Stevens, forced to sit out qualifying and the races in Australia and Malaysia due to issues, finally enjoyed a one-lap session. The 23-year-old Briton will start 19th, eight tenths of a second ahead of Roberto Merhi, albeit three seconds behind Alonso, underlining that whilst Manor are fighting, they still have a lot of work to do.

Lewis Hamilton claimed his third straight pole position of the season with a scintillating lap in Shanghai. Nico Rosberg was just 0.042secs slower than his Mercedes team-mate.

Article: Rangers kept the pressure on Hibernian in the race for second spot in the Championship with a comfortable 4-0 win over Raith Rovers. Hibs had secured a win over Hearts in the Edinburgh derby in the earlier kick-off and the Light Blues knew they had to respond. They bounced back from Thursday's defeat by Queen of the South, with Nicky Clark and Haris Vuckic claiming a goal apiece and Nicky Law grabbing a double. Nicky Clark celebrates after putting Rangers 1-0 up against Raith Rovers on Sunday. Clark in the air as he heads the ball towards goal to give the hosts the lead at Ibrox. Rangers manager Stuart McCall applauds the home fans after the full-time whistle. The win means Rangers and Hibs remain level on 61 points, albeit the Leith side have the better goal difference. Stuart McCall had suffered his first defeat as Rangers manager against Queens last week. So it was no real surprise to see him make three changes for the visit of Raith. Goalkeeper Cammy Bell was back between the sticks and Dean Shiels and Robbie Crawford were also added to the side. The Light Blues enjoyed the best possible start to the game when they surged into the lead after just six minutes. Clark found himself in plenty of space to connect with Law's corner and bullet a header home from 10 yards. Law then carved out a chance of his own but his shot from just inside the box was weak and easily held by Kevin Cuthbert. But the goalkeeper had no chance when Gers claimed their second of the day after 27 minutes. Vuckic cut inside from the right before unleashing a powerful drive into the bottom corner to claim his seventh Rangers goal. Haris Vuckic (left) fires the ball home to put Rangers 2-0 ahead against Raith Rovers. Vuckic (left) celebrates his Ibrox goal with team-mate Kenny Miller. Nicky Law slots it home to get the first of his two goals for Rangers on Sunday afternoon. Law (right) wheels away as he celebrates his goal for the home side. Raith could have pulled a goal back moments later but a well-struck free-kick from Ryan Conroy on the edge of the box was blocked by Bell. The visitors fired out another warning to Rangers shortly after the restart. Lewis Vaughan tried his luck with a snap-shot that fell inches past the upright as Raith tried to haul themselves back into the game. At the other end, the hosts passed up a decent chance to all but secure the three points. Vuckic released Crawford and he tried to tee up the shot for Law but he failed to connect in front of goal and the chance was lost. However Law was celebrating when he added his name to the scoresheet after 72 minutes, putting the game beyond Raith. Law's first attempt crashed off the crossbar but the ball fell kindly to his feet and he had the net bulging with the rebound from eight yards. Tom Walsh then saw a terrific volley saved well by the goalkeeper, before Law completed his double when he curled home from the edge of the box with two minutes to go. Law (left) strikes the ball towards goal as he scores Rangers' fourth goal of the afternoon. Law (left) is congratulated by his Rangers team-mates on his Sunday afternoon double. Former Rangers striker Michael Mols was among those in the directors' box at Ibrox on Sunday.

Article: An exotic bird in Brazil was recorded making incredible sounds that wouldn’t be out of place on a video game. The Curl-crested Jay, which resides at the Criadouro Onca Pintada breeding centre, is native to South America and is known to be a good mimic of other birds and man-made sounds. With the ever-growing presence of human’s in their natural habitats, the bird is one example of a number of species that have learned to incorporate peculiar everyday sounds into their song. Videoed behind a fence, the bird initially makes a sinister noise like a distorted voice before creating an almost digital sound. Following this the bird makes a noise that sounds like running water before a Space Invaders style tune emerges from it. Discussing the video, companion parrot behavioural expert Greg Glendell spoke with MailOnline about the various theories regarding the function of these sounds. The Curl-crested Jay is native to South America and resides at the Criadouro Onca Pintada breeding centre. ‘Several groups of birds have a lifelong ability to learn to reproduce new sounds; notably parrots, starlings and crows,’ said Mr Glendell. The particular Jay belongs to the Crow/Corvidae family. ‘Some birds may use them to impress a mate or their peers within their flock,’ he added. ‘Most birds using mimicry are highly social species, with a complex vocal repertoire, which includes innate calls and learnt calls. The bird is one example of a number of species that have learned to incorporate peculiar everyday sounds into their song. ‘As social species they use their calls as language. There are often regional dialects within bird groups. So the same species shows differences in its calls across its range.’ Mr Glendell also noted that sometimes captive birds confined to cages use their ability to mimic to relieve their boredom and ensure responses from their owners. The original video was uploaded to YouTube account: Swiatoczamigoski by a Polish-based blogger who has spent some time volunteering at the Brazilian breeding centre. Videoed behind a fence, the bird initially makes a sinister noise like a distorted voice before creating an almost digital sound.

Article: (The Hollywood Reporter)"Grace of Monaco," starring Nicole Kidman as star-turned-princess Grace Kelly, is heading straight to Lifetime. The critically-panned film, which opened last year's Cannes Film Festival, will premiere on Lifetime on Memorial Day, May 25. After the movie performed poorly in its international engagements, The Weinstein Co., which first purchased U.S. distribution rights at the 2013 Berlin Film Festival, decided to sell it directly to Lifetime rather than book it into U.S. theaters, a source confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter. THR: Grace of Monaco' Cannes review. The film, which was directed by Olivier Dahan and focuses on a period in the early '60s when Monaco was involved in a stand-off over taxes with France and Grace was contemplating a return to Hollywood, was originally scheduled for release in late 2013. Given the names involved, some handicappers had put it on their list of potential Oscar contenders. But when TWC pulled it out of awards contention and shifted its release to March 14, 2014, Dahan lashed out at TWC's Harvey Weinstein, over the movie's final cut, which the director was in the process of completing. "There are two versions of the film for now, mine and his," Dahan complained, continuing, "They want a commercial film smelling of daisies, taking out anything that exceeds that which is too abrupt, anything that makes it cinematic and breathe with life." That planned March release was then scrubbed, when Cannes expressed interest in debuting the director's version of the movie in May. Even before it screened, though, Grace's children blasted the picture as "needlessly glamorized and historically inaccurate" and boycotting the Cannes red carpet. THR: The Weinstein Co. nearing deal to keep 'Grace of Monaco' Weinstein didn't attend the movie's premiere either -- explaining that he had been visiting Syrian refugee camps in Jordan as part of a long-scheduled U.N.-sponsored trip. But TWC did strike a new distribution deal for the film in Cannes, agreeing to show Dahan's cut in the U.S., but acquiring rights for just $3 million upfront, a $2 million discount from its earlier contract. But TWC then did not slot "Grace of Monaco" into its fall, 2015 release schedule. Tim Roth costars as Kelly's husband Prince Rainier III, Frank Langella as Kelly's priest and confidante, Parker Posey as Grace's aid, and Paz Vega ("Spanglish," "Sex and Lucia") as opera singer Maria Callas.

Article: Alan Pardew says Sunderland should be more concerned about his in-form Crystal Palace side than his past as Newcastle manager this Saturday. Palace beat Manchester City on Monday night and have ambitions of finishing in the Barclays Premier League's top 10 this season. Pardew was the first Newcastle boss to suffer four successive defeats to Sunderland, who last weekend won a fifth Tyne-Wear derby in a row, but is now only thinking about Palace. 'We're going there in great form. The stadium will be wary of us, the 11 players on the pitch,' Pardew said. Glenn Murray (second from right) celebrates with his  team-mates after scoring against Manchester City. Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew thinks Sunderland fans should concentrate on his in-form side. 'Irrespective of my reception, it's about the 11 players on the pitch and Sunderland fans know that we're in really good form. 'The group is on a high. We have a different type of game this Saturday and we need to make the adjustment quickly.' Pardew arrived at Selhurst Park in January with top-flight survival the target. Performances and results have surpassed expectations, but Pardew insists the Eagles must stick to the characteristics which have seen them soar to 11th place in the table. 'It is now about trying to keep our professionalism and keep on the process of what's been winning us games,' Pardew added. 'We haven't set an outcome target, in terms of points we're going to get, but we have talked about the standards that we've set and that we need to maintain those. 'If we maintain them, then our position might surprise a few. Jason Puncheon celebrates after scoring Palace's winning goal in their 2-1 victory against champions City. Jermain Defoe scores a stunning winner for Sunderland in the Tyne-Wear derby against Newcastle. 'We're three points away from the top 10 so of course it is (a realistic target).' Pardew believes Palace players will be viewed in a more favourable light when it comes to international honours. He said: 'All our players are going to be looked at in a kinder manner, or through a different lens to how they've been looked at - and so they should be. 'Our form is as good as the top three or four clubs in the country and therefore they should receive the plaudits for what they're doing. That would be only what they deserve.' Mile Jedinak could come straight in after his four-game suspension as midfielder Joe Ledley is a doubt with a hip injury. Pardew added: 'Joe Ledley's got a slight strain and we'll have to monitor that. 'He's been exceptional since I've been here, so we'll give him every opportunity to play.' Pardew, after four years as Newcastle boss, knows Sunderland well and was not surprised the Black Cats turned to former Rangers and Holland boss Dick Advocaat. 'I think it was a great move for them to have someone of his experience at this time and he's proving that,' Pardew added. 'It's fair to say they've gone a little bit more direct, a little bit more positive. 'They have some good players and it's always a difficult place to go. 'I don't think we're under an illusions. It's a team coming off the back of a great victory (beating Newcastle 1-0) and they will be buoyed for our game.

Crystal Palace face Sunderland at the Stadium of Light on Saturday. Ex-Newcastle boss Alan Pardew is prepared for a frosty reception. But he believes Black Cats fans should be more concerned about his side. Sunderland are 15th in the table and three points clear of the drop zone.

Article: As seasons go, this one has been pretty close to perfect for Bristol City. Runaway leaders in Sky Bet League One, they became the first team in the Football League to mathematically secure promotion on Tuesday night - and in sensational style. Hitting Bradford City for six of the best in their own backyard saw them triumphantly over the finishing line, although given their free-wheeling and free-scoring form the result really came as little surprise. Aden Flint celebrates with a bottle of Sky Bet champagne following Bristol City's promotion. City players are sprayed with champagne after securing promotion from League One. And there’s more. Add to that their memorable Johnstone’s Paint Trophy victory at Wembley last month - when Walsall were comfortably beaten 2-0 in the final - and you have a truly historic campaign for Steve Cotterill’s team. The season has been a personal triumph for tall, tattooed defender Aden Flint, who has played a central role in returning City to the Championship after two seasons away. His uncompromising defensive style has been combined with a knack of scoring from set-pieces, leading to 11 goals this season. Flint was on target at Wembley, fulfilling a childhood dream in the process, and also at Valley Parade on Tuesday. The Robins stars shower each other in their isotonic drinks following victory against Bradford City on Tuesday. Flint scores his side's fourth goal of the game as City earn an impressive 6-0 at Valley Parade. ‘When the players and the manager sat down at the start of the season, we had three aims,’ he tells Sportsmail. ‘The first was to win promotion back to the Championship, the second was to go up as champions and the third was to win the Johnstone's Paint Trophy. ‘We've managed to do two of the three and hopefully on Saturday we can achieve the other.’ That’s because City need another win to make absolutely sure they will be promoted as champions. The 25-year-old defender celebrates as the Robins earned promotion to the Championship in style. City manager Steve Cotterill celebrates promotion with a commemorative bottle of champagne. They currently lead Preston North End by 10 points but the Lancashire side have a game in hand and so three points are required against Coventry City at Ashton Gate this weekend. ‘Nobody wants that runners-up medal. The aim was always to go up as champions and we’re close to achieving that,’ Flint says. ‘We’ve had that winning habit and it’s a good one to get in to. We’ve been top of the league for most of the season and to drop down to second now would be disappointing.’ Seldom does one team dominate a division in this way. The lowest City have been placed is fifth and that was after their opening day fixture. The Robins have enjoyed a memorable season which has included lifting the Johnstone's Paint Trophy. Once again, Flint (right) made a huge contribution, giving City the lead against Walsall on March 22. Flint wheels away in celebration after sending his side on their way to another memorable victory. Cotterill (left) and Jay Emmanuel-Thomas look delighted as they celebrate with the trophy at Wembley. They kicked on from there and set a ferocious pace throughout the autumn. Since September 13th, there has only been one week when they haven’t been top of the pile and they have lost just three games in all competitions since the New Year. Not that success has been reserved for the league. They reached the fourth round of the FA Cup, losing narrowly to Premier League West Ham, and claimed the Trophy too in front of over 40,000 of their fans at Wembley. Flint said: ‘I think any player dreams of scoring and winning at Wembley. There really isn't a better feeling in football. It is right up there with the highlights in my career but I would say that if we win on Saturday and go up as champions, that will push Wembley out.’ The defender’s goalscoring exploits have come as a surprise but he’s quick to credit his team-mates for the service: ‘I didn't expect to score as many as five to be honest! Flint holds the JPT with pride as he celebrates the 2-0 victory against Walsall last month. The defender was also named the Sky Bet League 1 Player of the Month for March. ‘I've just found myself in the right place at the right time to get on the end of all those set-pieces that have been delivered by the lads. ‘Aaron Wilbraham has bags of experience with him and has scored over 20 goals this season. Luke Freeman and Marlon Pack have been providing plenty of assists, not just for me but for everyone. ‘But everyone has chipped in, it has been a collective effort. The team spirit here has been the best I've ever experienced and it's been an enjoyable season.’ Promotion back to the Championship could be just the beginning of an exciting chapter in the club’s 118-year history.

Billionaire owner Steve Lansdown, who made his fortune in financial services, is funding a renovation of the club’s Ashton Gate home to expand the capacity to 27,000 and make it Premier League-ready. And, according to Flint, that’s precisely where the club is aiming: ‘We aim high and should be in the Championship, if not higher than that. ‘It's a massive city, I didn't realise how big it is until I moved here. It's surprising that the place hasn't got a Premier League team and maybe we can change that. ‘The chairman and the manager certainly have the ambition to achieve that. Seeing Bournemouth and Brentford doing so well in the Championship, nobody expected that and, who knows what will happen when we get there next season.’

Article: (CNN)In her 40 years living in Rochelle, Illinois, Cathy Olson had never seen a tornado that big. "I saw the top of the funnel cloud, and it was absolutely massive," she said. She watched the hulking gray twister grind past her town Thursday, tearing up its fringes. Farther north, in the rural Illinois hamlet of Fairdale, one person died as a twister shredded homes and ripped trees bare of leaves and most limbs. Only the thickest branches remained standing. It was the only death reported so far in two days of tornado touchdowns. Rochelle was fortunate. But in nearby Kirkland, debris was so thick on the roads, responders searching for trapped residents could not yet assess the damage or injuries, fire officials said. On Thursday, a video surfaced on YouTube of a massive twister barreling across an open field, barely missing farmhouses and barns. Images of the funnel turned up elsewhere on social media. Multiple tornadoes ripped through the rural Midwest on Thursday. A  large and dangerous twister tore across fields in Iowa. And a twister touched down 70 miles outside of St. Louis. Eight tornadoes were reported Wednesday in Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri, the Storm Prediction Center said. But it appears residents have been fortunate enough to come away from the terrifying weather spectacle alive. Hail stones the size of tennis balls plummeted down on Ashton, Illinois. It could have been worse as severe tornado damage dotted a path not far from the dense populations of Chicago and Rockford -- the state's third largest city.  The tornado cut a 22-mile path through Ogle County, according to disaster management coordinator Tom Richter. North of Rochelle, a tornado took away a local favorite restaurant -- Grubsteakers.  "It's kind of one of your little greasy spoon restaurants," said Eric Widick, who drove up in his truck to help out. "We're a community. If one person is in need, we'll all be there for them." People were inside when the storm quashed Grubsteakers and turned over a semitruck parked outside. No one was killed or seriously injured,  Widick said. Although a patron who found shelter in a restroom was trapped inside for about half an hour. People had been eating at Grubsteakers for some 25 years and will miss it, Widick said. In Rochelle, the tornado flattened some of Olson's friends' homes. A safe distance away from it, at her mother's house, she had to think about her husband, Chet, who was reelected mayor of the town of about 10,000 people the day before. He'd have a job ahead of him. "I have not been able to get a hold of him, Olson said, "but I know he's in touch with the sheriff and is safe," she said. Sheriff Brian VanVickle told journalists late Thursday that the tornado had spared life and limb in Ogle County aside from some people whose injuries were easily treatable. The county lost 20 homes -- one of them was his own. Fifty to 100 houses had significant damage, he said. Only foundations remained of some homes, said storm chaser Dan Gottschalk. "You can hear the hissing everywhere from where the structures used to be," he said. Lindsey Clark, a reporter from CNN affiliate WREX, said rescuers were pulling trapped people from a home in the Rochelle area. VanVickle was newly elected sheriff of Rochelle on Wednesday. On Thursday, the storm took his house and his sister-in-law's. "I've got the clothes on my back," he said. But his family wasn't at home when it hit. "My family was on the way to Louisville, dog was in the basement and she survived." It was the first tornado the sheriff had ever seen in his county. "I've lived here all my life, am the fifth generation in the county.  My mom said this is the first time she's ever seen a tornado." He is thankful that the National Weather Service warned one could come. That saved lives, he believes. The service warned of a "particularly dangerous situation." People across the Midwest should be on alert for severe weather. Tornado watches were set to run out early Friday. CNN's AnneClaire Stapleton, Catherine Shoichet, Greg Botelho, Dave Alsup, Steve Almasy, Jack Maddox and Sean Morris contributed to this report.

Article: Sunday's trip to Loftus Road marks Chelsea’s 700th game under the ownership of Roman Abramovich, a period Jose Mourinho says has been positive not only for the club but for English football as a whole. Some would quibble with the second part of that statement, but Mourinho says that too will change. If the first 699 games under Russian rule has established Chelsea at the top of English and European football, Mourinho believes the next 700 will see them supply more players for the English national team as they implement Abramovich’s demand to follow Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules. Sunday's trip to Loftus Road marks Chelsea’s 700th game under the ownership of Roman Abramovich. Abramovich (right) celebrates with Frank Lampard (centre) and John Terry after Chelsea clinch their first Premier League title under his ownership in 2005. The Russian finally got his hands on the Champions League trophy following Chelsea's success in 2012. Mourinho also believes Chelsea’s adherence to FFP — ‘compared with other clubs and owners who didn’t want to play under the rules’, he pointed out in a thinly veiled dig at Manchester City — positions them as standard bearers for the English game. There can certainly be no doubt Chelsea are in a far stronger position than when Abramovich bought the club from Ken Bates for £140m on June 1, 2003. In the intervening 12 years he has spent in the region of £842.9m on transfer fees, winning three Premier Leagues, four FA Cups, three League Cups, one Europa League and one Champions League, but now, Mourinho says, Abramovich’s rule will benefit England as well as Chelsea. Jose Mourinho, seen here with Abramovich in 2004, has has been in charge of Chelsea for almost five of the Russian's 12 seasons at Stamford Bridge. The Blues have won three Premier Leagues, four FA Cups, three League Cups, one Europa League and one Champions League since 2004. ‘He has been good for Chelsea, good for English football, good for European football,’ said Mourinho, who has been in charge for almost five of those 12 seasons. ‘Chelsea after him became strong, a top club in the country and a top club in Europe. I think that’s very, very good. I think it’s important and I think it’s also important the message Mr Abramovich and this club are passing now. ‘The decision to accept the [Financial Fair Play] rules and play under the rules I think is a big decision compared with other clubs and other owners that didn’t accept the rules and didn’t want to play under the rules. Chelsea are in a far stronger position than when Abramovich bought the club from Ken Bates in 2003. ‘Will the next 700 games under him be good for the English national side? I believe so. In the first team, we had some important players in the national team. 'John Terry, Ashley Cole, Joe Cole, Frank Lampard, Wayne Bridge, Shaun Wright-Phillips. We had a nucleus of four, five players that were always in the national team. ‘Now we are going through a period where it’s just about Gary Cahill. But we have some young boys coming into the first-team. Ruben [Loftus-Cheek] is already here. Normally, in a few years they should be there [in the national side].’ Gary Cahill (above) is now Chelsea's only senior England international in the current first team squad. Mourinho believes the likes of Ruben Loftus-Cheek (left) and Dominic Solanke will represent Chelsea and England for years to come. Mourinho did not name them, but Dominic Solanke, Patrick Bamford, Lewis Baker and Isaiah Brown are thought to be highly-rated at Chelsea, who supply many of the players in England’s age-group teams. The question is whether their young English players will be given the chance in the first team at a club who can take a huge step towards the title by winning at QPR today. It is a game Chelsea go into mindful of decisive slips in last season’s title race but with the title firmly in their own hands now, Mourinho is confident no mistakes will be made. Chelsea are on the verge of a domestic double after picking up the Capital One Cup in March. Mourinho has won seven major trophies while in charge of the west London club. He added: ‘Don’t make me remember the game against Sunderland because that was the game which stopped us fighting for the title. I don’t want to speak again about that game. ‘Last season we were depending on others. We needed this team to lose a couple of points here, a couple of points there. This situation is different. ‘Now we are in a position where we can be isolated of everything. We don’t have to be watching Man City against Man United. We don’t have to be waiting for what they are going to do. It’s just us.’ Fabio Borini celebrates scoring the winning goal during Sunderland's 2-1 win against Chelsea last season. Mourinho believes last season's defeat against Sunderland'stopped' Chelsea from fighting for the title.

Article: A once in a lifetime shot, they said, but it appears Charlie Adam has done it before. The Stoke midfielder has been the talk of football this Easter weekend after his incredible 66-yard goal against Chelsea. Adam's sweetly struck left-footed strike gave goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois absolutely no chance. Scroll down to watch video of Charlie Adam scoring from the halfway line in 2009. Charlie Adam picks the ball up inside his own half during a reserve match against Accrington Stanley. Adam knocks the ball out in front of him before spotting the goalkeeper of his line and shooting. The Stanley keeper tries desperately to stop the ball as it sails towards the goal. The goalkeeper is left sprawled on the floor as the ball hits the back of the net. And that is not the first time the Scot has had a goalkeeper frantically back-pedalling before picking the ball out of his own net. Back in 2009, Adam scored a similar effort for Blackpool reserves against Accrington Stanley. He was in the opposition half this time though was out wide before hitting an effort that draws similarities with David Beckham's famous goal against Wimbledon in 1996. The stage, it has to be said, was far smaller too, though it's easy to see why Adam backed himself at Stamford Bridge on this evidence.

Article: (CNN)Eyewitness video showing white North Charleston police Officer Michael Slager shooting to death an unarmed black man has exposed discrepancies in the reports of the first officers on the scene. Slager has been fired and charged with murder in the death of 50-year-old Walter Scott. A bystander's cell phone video, which began after an alleged struggle on the ground between Slager and Scott, shows the five-year police veteran shooting at Scott eight times as Scott runs away. Scott was hit five times. If words were exchanged between the men, they're are not audible on the tape. It's unclear what happened before Scott ran, or why he ran. The officer initially said that he used a Taser on Scott, who, Slager said, tried to take the weapon. Before Slager opens fire, the video shows a dark object falling behind Scott and hitting the ground. It's unclear whether that is the Taser. Later in the video, when Slager approaches Scott's body, Slager appears to drop a dark object near Scott. Slager is seen in the video handcuffing Scott after the shooting. Witness: I nearly erased shooting video out of fear. Feidin Santana, the witness who recorded the video, said he didn't see Scott grab Slager's Taser. His account contradicts what Slager told dispatchers. In two interviews with NBC, Santana said that he was walking to his job in North Charleston on Saturday morning when he saw Slager chase Scott, who had been pulled over for a broken taillight. Santana told NBC's Lester Holt on Wednesday that he saw the two men struggling on the ground. "They were down on the (ground)... before I started recording," Santana said. "I remember the police (officer) had control of the situation. He had control of Scott." Santana said he heard the sound of a Taser being used. He believed Scott was trying to get away from it. But Scott never got the Taser or used it on the officer, Santana told NBC. Who was Walter Scott? A North Charleston Police report included brief statements from eight police officers, but not Slager. One officer, identified as Sgt. J. Gann, said in the report he was conducting a separate traffic stop about 9:30 a.m. Saturday when he heard -- apparently via radio -- Slager say he was "in foot pursuit" of another motorist. Gann said that while driving to the officer's location, "Slager advised that he deployed his Taser and (requested) back up units." Seconds later, Gann reported, he heard Slager tell a dispatcher, "Shots fired and the subject is down. He took my Taser." Hours after the shooting, The Post and Courier of Charleston quoted a statement from police spokesman Spencer Pryor, who said Slager attempted to use his Taser to stop a fleeing suspect.  The men struggled over the device, with the suspect taking the Taser and attempting to use it against Slager, the newspaper reported. In the police report, another officer, J. Banias, said he was heading to the scene about 10 minutes after the initial call. Slager asked him to "secure his vehicle at the site of the traffic stop." Banias said he spoke to a passenger in the car Scott was driving. "The passenger was... detained and placed in the back seat of my vehicle," the officer reported. The passenger's identity was not given in the report, but the officer said in the report that the passenger was detained. Scott family spokesman Ryan Julison confirmed to CNN that a man was with Scott and said he is not related to the family. The family declined to provide any more information. A timeline of events. The North Charleston Police Department is not providing additional information, citing an ongoing investigation of Scott's killing by the independent South Carolina Law Enforcement Division. Gann said when he arrived at the shooting scene, an officer identified only as Habersham "was administering first aid" to Scott. "I exited my vehicle and assisted Officer Habersham with first aid and CPR to the driver," Gann said in the report. "We continued to perform first aid and CPR until EMS arrived... When EMS and first responders arrived, EMS took care over providing care to the driver, who was pronounced deceased a short time later." Habersham, in his account, did not mention performing CPR. "I attempted to render aid to the victim by applying pressure to the gunshot wounds and (directing) the best route for EMS and fire to get to the victim faster," he said in the report. An officer identified as Sgt. Webb said that he requested an ambulance. Webb said that at 9:41 a.m. he saw Habersham "administering chest compression to the defendant." North Charleston Police Chief  Eddie Driggers was asked at a news conference this week whether CPR was performed on Scott. "I do not know. I was told that life-saving... that they tried to save his life," Driggers said. North Charleston Mayor Keith Summey added that not every North Charleston police officer is CPR certified. What we know about Officer Slager.

Article: The huge build-up to England women's Under 19 replay against Norway was truly bizarre and unprecedented. And it was a game only supposed to last for 18 seconds. Leah Williamson held incredible nerve to retake a penalty which she ought to have taken on Saturday, were it not for German referee Marjia Kurtes' terrific blunder. Kurtes disallowed Williamson's penalty for encroachment from England players at the weekend, but instead of ordering her back to the spot, awarded a free-kick to Norway. Leah Williamson (centre) stepped up again to take the penalty during the 18-second rematch against Norway. Williamson went the same way as her successful spot-kick last Saturday and found the net once again. Norwegian goalkeeper Oda Marie Hove Bogstad was unable to stop Williamson's brilliant effort. The England captain wheels away in celebration after handing her side a crucial 2-2 draw. But England were given a lifeline when UEFA chiefs ruled it should be replayed. All match details from Saturday, including the time of day the penalty was awarded, the venue, the players who were on the pitch, were ticked off by the Swiss blazers and the game was restarted at 9.45pm. And that was a whole FIVE hours after both had played their final Elite Round games in Northern Ireland. Only Kurtes was replaced, by referee Kateryna Zora. It began in what would have been the 96th minute, and ended 65 seconds later. Leah said: 'They were the longest 24 hours of my life, I hadn't slept. I think I was just excited, I went through so many emotions and just felt excitement, so I thought 'yep, that's how I am going to feel'! 'We had a conversation just before I came out which was quite emotional, we have been through a bigger journey than some people go through in their whole careers because of what happened, it was never about me, it was about the team. The England players celebrate Williamson's penalty which earned them a 2-2 draw in Belfast. England held on in the final moments to secure the draw and, with it, a place in this summer's finals in Israel. Williamson blows a kiss to the crowd as Mo Marley's side look ahead to this summer's tournament. Number of seconds played: 65.18 after the players returned to the centre circle. Number of England players on the pitch: Norway were already down to 10 outfield players, but England brought on a sub to replace one injured in the game vs Switzerland. Days between spot-kicks: Five days between Saturday's clash and the controversial rematch. Number of goals scored: 1 - the infamous penalty. 'When something is taken away from you like that, you realise just how much you want it, and that's what happened. Qualifying is such a huge deal for us, it's massive.' Norway discovered minutes before the penalty was retaken they would qualify for the July finals in Israel, as best runners-up across all Elite Round groups. Had the penalty been missed, Norway would have finished table-toppers, and the Dutch would have progressed as best second-placed team. It was the most surreal football you could imagine, starting from the penalty spot, with none of the regular pomp of a competitive international, yet much more attention than a girls' game normally yields. Under-age women's games in Northern Ireland, if the passionate hosts aren't playing, are usually lucky to attract treble figures. England are awarded a penalty during their European U19 Women's Championships qualifier on Saturday. Referee Marija Kurtes points to the spot as England are awarded a penalty in the 96th minute. Williamson steps up to take a penalty in the closing stages of the match against Norway in Belfast. Williamson runs forward to strike the ball but team-mate Rosella Ayane (circled) has entered the box. Williamson turns and celebrates as she slots the ball into the goalkeeper's bottom-right corner. German referee Marija Kurtes officiating a women's Bundesliga match in Munich last month. England players celebrate after they thought they had equalised against Norway. But referee Kurtes awards an indirect free-kick and the celebrations are cut short. Williamson has the ball back in her hands ready for what she thought would be a retake. While the disgraced Kurtes, who was sent home after her blunder, will be keen to shelve her nightmare, Williamson's name will crop up in pub quizzes for generations. England coach Mo Marley said: 'Obviously the tournament has been tough and pretty much it's about following through in the right way. We are happy we gave ourselves a chance to qualify and everything has turned out the way we wanted it, for Norway as well. 'I know how hard these players have worked, credit to all of the other teams, and credit to Norway, we deserve to be in the finals. 'It's ironic because a lot of the hard work we did at the start of the week was about a long journey, handling the intense pressure of a tournament and tests to our resolve, which helped a lot. But Williamson then realises the referee's decision and two Norwegian players are seen celebrating. German referee Kurtes is understood to have been sent home following her error on Saturday. 'Everyone was aware of the possible outcomes, we may not have scored the penalty, we know that. 'We may not have got through. But we are just so tremendously happy.' Since this odd chain of events stemmed from an infringement of the game's laws, UEFA's disciplinary committee did exactly the right thing in instructing for it to be replayed. But it sets a dangerous precedent. England's appeal cost just £750, which is repayable to the FA as it was successful, but was it lodged just because it's arguably a lower level of football? It triggers questions concerning how many more appeals of this nature could happen in the future. In a men's senior England international, one presumes one of the tens of thousands of people would correct the referee, whereas perhaps the same can't be guaranteed with a three-figure crowd. Indeed, would you have that inexcusable refereeing in the first place? September 2005 - World Cup qualifier - Uzbekistan vs Bahrain. Uzbekistan had won the opening leg of the Asian zone fourth-round play-off 1-0 at home but were left incensed after a penalty was disallowed in the 38th minute for an attacking player encroaching. Rather than retaking the penalty, an indirect free-kick was wrongly awarded by Japanese referee Toshimitsu Yoshida to Bahrain and the game ended with a one-goal margin. Uzbekistan called for an investigation but were left furious after FIFA ordered the match to be replayed in its entirety with the result declared invalid. It proved to have a major impact as it was Bahrain who eventually went through with a 1-1 away goals victory, though they were later beaten in the AFC-CONCACAF play-off. Bahrain staff and players celebrate after beating Uzbekistan in an Asian World Cup qualifier in 2005.

Dortmund (4-2-3-1): Weidenfeller; Sokratis, Subotic, Hummels, Schmelzer; Bender, Gundogan (Mkhitaryan 79); Blaszczykowski (Kagawa 67), Reus, Kampl (Ramos 67); Aubameyang. Subs not used: Kehl, Langerak, Ginter, Dudziak. Booked: Aubameyang, Schmelzer. Bayern Munich: Neuer; Benatia, Boateng, Dante; Rafinha, Lahm (Thiago 69), Alonso, Schweinsteiger (Rode 58), Bernat; Muller (Gotze 79), Lewandowski. Subs not used: Pizarro, Gaudino, Reina, Weiser. Booked: Schweinsteiger, Alonso, Rode. Scorer(s): Lewandowski 36. Bayern suffered a shock 2-0 home defeat by Borussia Monchengladbach before the international break but responded to get their title charge back on track against their former championship rivals. Dortmund were unbeaten in their last eight domestic matches, sitting comfortably in mid-table after rescuing a desperate-looking situation earlier this year that saw Jurgen Klopp's side bottom of the table. But they were behind after 36 minutes against Bayern. Thomas Muller was released down the left channel but his low drive, after bursting towards the box, was parried by Roman Weidenfeller. Unfortunately for the Dortmund goalkeeper the ball rebounded invitingly for Lewandowski to beat Marcel Schmelzer to the ball and head home from 12 yards. Dortmund offered a spirited fightback  as the hosts applied much of the second-half pressure, but the Bayern defence held firm although they had Manuel Neuer to thank after saving brilliantly from a Marco Reus free kick in the closing stages. As his team-mates roared wildly around him Lewandowski did not celebrate against his former club. The goal did, however, send the Bayern bench into raptures although Pep Guardiola remained calm. Goalscorer Lewandowski holds off the challenge of Dortmund's Kevin Kampl. The teams line up to observe a minute silence for the passengers of the Germanwings flight that crashed.

Article: An attacker got more than he bargained for - when his chosen victim floored him twice with her martial arts skills after he tried to rape her. The unidentified restaurant owner was attacked by the would-be rapist as she was closing the empty shop in the eastern province of Shandong, China. She let the man into the eatery when he knocked on the door and asked to use the toilet, The People's Daily reported. The restaurant owner used her martial arts skills to overpower the would-be rapist and pin him to the ground. The unidentified woman then raced out of the restaurant - but was followed by her attacker. The man tried to grab her - but had a shock of his own when she used her self-defence skills to overpower him. CCTV images from inside the restaurant show how the woman, who was wearing a mini-skirt and heels, pinned her attacker to the floor and put her hands around his throat - warning him to leave her alone. She then fled the restaurant but he tried to attack her again - only for the intrepid restaurateur to knock him down outside the eatery and escape unharmed. The entire, extraordinary drama was captured on security cameras inside and outside the restaurant, which police used to trace the man. The assailant was arrested two weeks later and is set to stand trial for attempted rape. The woman was followed outside by her attacker but fought him off again using her martial arts skills.

Article: (CNN)Kanye West has settled a lawsuit with a paparazzi photographer he assaulted -- and the two have shaken on it. The photographer, Daniel Ramos, had filed the civil suit against West  after the hip-hop star attacked him and tried to wrestle his camera from him in July 2013 at Los Angeles International Airport. West pleaded no contest last year to a misdemeanor count of battery over the scuffle. A judge sentenced him to two years' probation, as well as anger management sessions and community service. Ramos and his lawyer, Gloria Allred, sought general and punitive damages in the civil suit, saying that West had interfered with the photographer's rights to pursue a lawful occupation. The case had been set for trial next week, but Allred issued a statement Tuesday night saying Ramos' side had filed a dismissal "because the case was settled to the satisfaction of the parties." She didn't disclose the details of the settlement other than saying that "one important aspect of it was an apology by Kanye West to our client, Daniel Ramos." Her statement included a picture of West and Ramos shaking hands, which she said happened after the apology. The original incident was caught on video, including the following exchange. "Kanye! Kanye! Talk to me, Kanye!" Ramos shouts outside a terminal at the Los Angeles airport on the night of July 19, 2013. "What's' going on? Why can't we talk to you?  I mean, why?" he asks as West moves through a group of paparazzi. "Now come on, Kanye, I don't want to fight with you," he says as West advances toward him. "I told you, don't talk to me, right," West says. "You're trying to get me in trouble so I step off and have to pay you like $250,000." West is then seen rushing the photographer and attempting to wrestle his camera from his hands. West retreats after about 15 seconds of scuffling with the photographer. "We believe that this case sent an important message," Allred said. "Celebrities are not above the law, and they have no right to physically attack someone simply because they were asked a question." Beverly Hills Police investigated an incident in January 2014 in which West was accused of assaulting a man at a Beverly Hills chiropractor's office. West avoided criminal charges by reaching a civil settlement with the man. Kanye West apologizes to Beck, Bruno Mars. CNN's Sonya Hamasaki contributed to this report.

Article: Manchester United players hung a fake bird above Ashley Young's peg in the dressing room after a bird pooed in his mouth during a top-flight match, Luke Shaw has revealed. As United kicked off their Premier League season with a match against  Swansea in August, Young received a surprise delivery from a bird mid-match, much to the amusement of his team-mates, who took advantage of the situation. Speaking exclusively to Match of the Day magazine, Shaw said: 'Ashley Young is the joker in the dressing room. We still laugh about the time he got bird poo in his mouth against Swansea. Manchester United left back Luke Shaw (second left) trains at the club's Aon Complex on Friday. Shaw admits that Ashley Young is the biggest joker in the Manchester United dressing room. He says the players still laugh at the time Young got bird poo in his mouth during a match against Swansea. 'If you ask him now, he'll say it wasn't bird poo. In the changing room we hung a fake bird above his place as a joke which he didn't like.' Shaw's revelations come as he nears the end of his first season at Old Trafford. His transition from Southampton star to £31.5million United man has been more difficult than he would have liked, with the left back making just 17 appearances this season. He has suffered a number of injuries, limiting his time on the pitch, but still appears to have settled into his new surroundings well. He admits he picks up tips from goalkeeper David de Gea, who has been in impressive form on the pitch for Louis van Gaal's side. According to Shaw, he is not just a top goalkeeper, but is approachable off the pitch when players need advice too. According to Shaw, United goalkeeper David de Gea is the 'nicest guy in football' and is always approachable. Louis van Gaal's stern demeanour is not limited to the touchline; at training he is equally as focused. Shaw has struggled with a number of injuries since arriving at Manchester United from Southampton. 'David de Gea is funny, he’s kind, if you want to talk to him you can talk to him – he’s the nicest guy in football! 'He’s been unbelievable for us this season and kept us in so many games, he’s starting to become the best goalkeeper in the world.” 'We’ve got a few Spanish-speaking players and they’re always playing their music and dancing around – the English lads hate it. Sometimes we can’t understand them, they say stuff to us and we’re like ‘What?’” After a disappointing campaign under David Moyes last season, Shaw's arrival coincided with that of Van Gaal, who has turned things around at Old Trafford. Now, United look certain to be heading towards a top-four finish, and Shaw admits that Van Gaal's pitch-side focus isn't limited to match-days; at training he is just as stern. 'The manager is always focused on his job, and his job is to win games. I haven’t seen a cheeky side to him yet, but you could say he has one. 'When we’re on the training pitch it’s like a game day, 100 per cent focus, nothing will change his mind or his focus, he’s always on the ball.'

Article: Hibs, Hearts and Rangers united in condemnation of the SPFL's decision to move the Ibrox club's final game of the Championship season back 24 hours. In a move designed to accommodate broadcasters, Rangers will face champions Hearts at Tynecastle on May 3 — 24 hours after Hibs and promotion rivals Falkirk and Queen of the South play. Adamant the final round of fixtures should be played at the same time to avert any competitive advantage for Stuart McCall's side, Easter Road chief executive Leanne Dempster and Hearts chairwoman Ann Budge have lodged formal complaints with the league. In a staggering misjudgment of the public mood, however, the SPFL issued a statement expressing surprise at the fuss before Rangers boss McCall compounded their woe by revealing he also backed Hibs' stance. Hibernian are upset that Rangers' final game of the season has been pushed back for TV purposes. Ramping up the pressure on SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster, Hibs counterpart Leanne Dempster said: 'In previous seasons, the League has ensured that all of the final round fixtures are played at the same time. 'I have been in contact with the SPFL following its announcement that one final-round fixture would kick off after all the other results are known. 'I have reminded them in very clear terms that — as organisers of the competition — the responsibility for protecting its unimpeachable sporting integrity lies with them.' On a day when the relationship between broadcasters and Scottish football came under unprecedented scrutiny, Hearts majority shareholder Budge backed up her city rivals. In a statement, Budge also queried the'sporting integrity' of Rangers playing 24 hours after their rivals given they are engaged in a dogfight with Hibs for second place. 'This has been done following selection of the game for a live TV broadcast,' she said. 'While we all knew that this was likely to be a strong candidate for televising and that the time might well change, we did not for one minute think that at this late stage, it would be moved to the Sunday, especially given our belief that all Championship games would require to be played at the same time. 'On learning of the change, I immediately attempted to contact the SPFL and objected in strong terms to the proposed late change to this fixture on the grounds of it having a total disregard for the interests of supporters of both clubs and an apparent disregard for sporting integrity. Rangers will play Hearts at Tynecastle in their final game of the season on May 3. 'Being given 17 days' notice of this change is extremely disruptive and potentially very expensive for the fans, the sponsors and indeed the club. Overseas supporters have been in touch to advise that they will lose substantial amounts on travel; others have advised of lost earnings, holiday problems, etc. 'None of this is good for any of us and on behalf of the club, I can only apologise. 'When it also became apparent to us that our fixture was the only game to be moved, we were equally alarmed as rightly or wrongly, this casts a shadow over the sporting integrity of the Championship. 'While it may not be enshrined in the newly-merged rulebook of the SPFL, it is protocol the football world over for fixtures such as the last day of the Championship to be played simultaneously. 'To move only one, (or even two or four) out of 5 fixtures would seem to be leaving our game wide open to unsavoury accusations. 'I will be sending in a formal complaint to the SPFL in relation to this appallingly late decision. It is no wonder that clubs are finding it harder and harder to gain support from their fans when their interests can be so blatantly disregarded, especially at such short notice. 'I am advised that this complaint will likely have no impact on the original decision but nevertheless, I want our supporters to know that we have taken all and any action that we could have and I will further comment on the situation once we have been updated by the League.' Responding to the criticism, however, the SPFL rushed out a statement saying it was 'unreasonable' to expect all Championship games to kick off simultaneously. 'In response to recent criticisms of the Championship fixture scheduling for the weekend 2/3 May, we'd like to clarify some specific points. On this weekend, the Hearts v Rangers match is scheduled for Sunday 3 May to be broadcast on television and it is not clear to us why this has caused so much surprise. This is a key game in the Championship season and will inevitably attract huge interest from fans around the world. Hearts are already promoted from the Championship, but they too condemned the fixture change. 'It is unreasonable to expect all Championship fixtures that weekend to move to the Sunday when a number of them will be unaffected by the Hearts v Rangers tie. However, as a result of this fixture, all Championship clubs have been invited to submit a request should they wish to move games to the Sunday. 'To date, we have had no request from Hibernian FC to move its fixture to the Sunday at the time of writing (8.45pm, Wednesday 15 April). 'We also note speculation that Police Scotland expressed concern to the SPFL about the scheduling of the Hearts v Rangers match. However, Police Scotland confirmed to us that there were no security issues with the scheduling of all Championship fixtures that weekend. 'Whilst we regret any inconvenience to supporters caused by rescheduled fixtures, the circumstances surrounding the matches on the weekend of 2/3 May are in no way unusual.' After his side drew with Livingston last night, however, Ibrox manager McCall gave his view, saying: 'First and foremost, we've not asked for the game to be changed. Hibs are complaining about it and rightly so. I'd be doing exactly the same. I think every game on the last day of the season should be played at the same time. 'But we've told by the TV, I believe, that it may be the case that the other games are moved to the Sunday. I honestly don't know. It's nothing to do with us. We've not asked for that, but if I was in Hibs' position then, yes, I would be annoyed as well. Of course. 'I was happy to play on the Saturday. We've not tried to gain any advantage - we've been told when to play. TV controls a lot of things. If the game definitely has to go ahead on the Sunday then can we all then move to the Sunday. I'd be happy with that. I would imagine that it will be changed over the next 24 or 48 hours to play at the same time. It would be only right.'

Article: Ronny Deila has admitted Celtic will enter the Champions League qualifiers minus defender Jason Denayer. The SPFL young player of the month for March, 19-year-old Denayer is wanted back at parent club Manchester City for a pre-season assessment. Keen to pursue a first-team breakthrough after making his international debut for Belgium last month, doubts over the future of Manuel Pellegrini may yet hand the Parkhead the chance of a second loan deal.

But Deila admits that won’t happen in time for the first Champions League qualifier on July 16. ‘City want Jason back for pre-season to see what kind of level he is at and where he stands and get the group together and maybe he will be loaned out again or he will stay. That is up to Jason and the manager,’ Deila explained. ‘We will see what happens - but it is very hard just now. We will look for a central defender anyway, one maybe two.’ Ronny Deila confirmed that the defender would be missing for the Champions League qualifers in July. Denayer remains non-committal on the prospect of an extended loan deal and added: ‘I only try to focus my mind on what is happening at Celtic and try to do my best for them. I always try to give my best level for Celtic, that’s what I need to do if I’m to reach the highest level in football. ‘I haven’t spoken to Patrick Vieira or anyone at City but I hope they are happy with my progress. ‘I feel that I have improved a lot from the start of the season, I’m a more mature player and my style of play is also different from when I first arrived. ‘Some of the strikers I come up against in Scotland are big and strong. They are big and a bit different to what I have been used to but I have improved with every game.’ Denayer has been an instant hit at the club and formed a formidable partnership with Virgil van Dijk.

Article: (CNN)"A long, long, time ago..." Those five words, when uttered or sung, makes baby boomers immediately think of Don McLean's pop masterpiece "American Pie."  It's hard to believe that his phenomenal 8½ minute allegory, which millions of Americans know by heart, is 44 years old.  All sorts of historical cross-currents play off each other in this timeless song, brilliantly gilded with the unforgettable chorus, which starts as "Bye, Bye, Miss American Pie." There is no real way to categorize McLean's "American Pie" for its hybrid of modern poetry and folk ballad, beer-hall chant and high-art rock. On Tuesday, Christie's sold the 16-page handwritten manuscript of the song's lyrics for $1.2 million to an unnamed buyer. McLean was a paperboy when, on February 3, 1959, he saw that Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and J.P. "The Big Bopper" Richardson had been tragically killed in an airplane crash in Clear Lake, Iowa. "The next day I went to school in shock and guess what?" McLean recalled.  "Nobody cared.  Rock 'n' roll in those days was sort of like hula hoops and Buddy hadn't had a big hit on the charts since '57."  By cathartically writing "American Pie," McLean has guaranteed that the memory of those great musicians lives forever. Having recorded his first album, "Tapestry," in 1969, in Berkeley, California, during the student riots, McLean, a native New Yorker, became a kind of weather vane for what he called the "generation lost in space."   When his cultural anthem "American Pie" was released in November 1971, it replaced Bob Dylan's "The Times They Are A Changin" as the Peoples Almanac of the new decade.  It's important to think of "American Pie" as one would of Henry Longfellow's "Evangeline" or Johnny Mercer's "Moon River" -- an essential Americana poem emanating wistful recollection, blues valentine, and youthful protest rolled into one.  There is magic brewing in the music and words of "American Pie," for McLean's lyrics and melody frame a cosmic dream, like those Jack Kerouac tried to conjure in his poetry-infused novel "On the Road." Don McLean: Buddy Holly, rest in peace. Influenced by Pete Seeger and the Weavers, McLean proudly wore the mantle of troubadour in the early 1970s, when "American Pie" topped the Billboard charts, and has never shed the cape.   Wandering far and wide, singing "American Pie" at windblown dance halls in Wyoming and cloistered colleges in New England, at huge amphitheaters in California and little coffee houses in the Hudson River Valley, McLean has performed his global anthem thousands of times.  Yet the encore number never loses its transfixing allure. When McLean prods audiences by rhapsodizing "and they were singing" everybody spontaneously joins in with the "Bye, Bye" chorus.  Watching McLean deliver his most notable song in concert is to take part in a collective Happening. What makes "American Pie" so unusual is that it isn't a relic from the counterculture but a talisman, which, like a sacred river, keeps bringing joy to listeners everywhere.  When "American Pie" suddenly is played on a jukebox or radio it's almost impossible not to sing along.   Like "Danny Boy" or "Streets of Laredo" or "Shenandoah," it's eternal.  With illusions to football fields and rock 'n' roll, river levees and nursery rhymes, the song cascades along like a boat going down Niagara Falls or a roller coaster that jumps tracks but floats instead of crashes. After all these years, "American Pie" still makes me feel empowered and yet filled with a sense of loss.  The song is alive and joyful, yet fretful about a world gone wrong.  It is a song that will never die.  A reverie for the ages.   There is a jump to the chorus, which forces the mind to relive the '50s, '60s and '70s, to troll through the back pages of our lives while, like a traditional Irish folksong, it reminds us of fate. While McLean, the muse, has rightfully not tried to interpret "American Pie," it's fair to surmise that "the king" is Elvis Presley, "Helter Skelter" refers to the Charles Manson murders, the "jester on the sidelines in a cast" is Bob Dylan, and "Jack Flash" the Rolling Stones.  But who knows?  The lyric remains a puzzle open to thousands of spirited interpretations.  As a literary artifact of the early 1970s, there isn't anything to compare to "American Pie." Normally, I don't like rankings of literature or songs or even presidents, for that matter.  But the fact that the Recording Industry of America and the National Endowment of the Arts chose "American Pie" as the fifth greatest song of the 20th century speaks to the composition's importance as an enduring piece of pop art.  The other four were "Over the Rainbow" (by Harold Arlen and E.Y "Yip" Harburg), "White Christmas "(by Irving Berlin), "This Land is Your Land" (by Woody Guthrie) and "Respect" (by Otis Redding).  That is fine company. Quite simply, "American Pie" is one of the greatest songs ever written.  And Tuesday the original lyrics found a new home.

Article: Whether it is through Sir Bradley Wiggins, Geraint Thomas or Ian Stannard, Ireland's classics king Sean Kelly believes the time has come for Team Sky to break their duck in one of cycling's Monuments. With the two major cobbled classics - the Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix - looming large over the next two weekends, it is time to see the early results of Sir Dave Brailsford's move to put more emphasis on the Spring Classics in his second five-year plan for Team Sky. With Wiggins electing to sign off his Team Sky career with an appearance at Paris-Roubaix on April 12, the races are bound to be a big part of the team's season whatever the outcome. British Bradley Wiggins competes during the  the Gent-Wevelgem one day cycling race on March 29. The shift in emphasis has already paid dividends in the early part of the season, with Stannard defending his title at Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, Team Sky's third victory in the Belgian race, while Thomas last week won E3 Harelbeke - a key warm-up for this weekend's Tour of Flanders. Kelly, whose record of nine Monument wins puts him in a tie for third all-time, likes what he sees from Team Sky as the big races approach. 'Right now they're looking really good,' Kelly said. 'They've been very impressive in the semi-classics. Can they finish it off by winning a big one?' Team Sky's focus on the Grand Tours up to now has left them short of riders equipped to win classics, while the usually chaotic nature of the races is anathema to their favoured controlling tactics. But the development of Stannard and Thomas gives Team Sky two in-house contenders, while Wiggins raised eyebrows with his ninth-placed finish in Paris-Roubaix last year and he vowed to return. Luke Rowe could also be another British option for the team. Ian Stannard (3rd from front) rides in the Gent-Wevelgem one-day cycling race on March 29. Injuries to classics specialists Fabian Cancellara (Trek Factory) and Tom Boonen (Etixx-QuickStep) - although the latter may return in time for Paris-Roubaix - add to the impression that Team Sky's best chance may be now. 'Without Cancellara, without Boonen, it's going to be a more open race,' said Kelly, who will commentate on both the Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix for Eurosport. 'There's going to be eight-10 guys saying they can win and Sky have three of them. Geraint is certainly in there, Stannard is maybe a little bit under his best after his crash (in the first Monument, Milan-San Remo on March 22) but can come back, and then of course there is Wiggins.' Of the three, Wiggins is yet to show the sort of form this season which suggests he can win Paris-Roubaix, but Kelly is not counting the 2012 Tour de France winner out, saying a Monument win to add to his Tour and world time trial success would elevate Wiggins to 'another level'. 'If you look at the way he's performing at the moment, for me, it's not as good as I would like him to be in the recent races, but you can't go to Paris-Roubaix with only one card to play,' Kelly said. Geraint Thomas celebrates placing third in the Belgian cycling classic Ghent-Wevelgem. 'With Thomas and Stannard as well, you play all of those cards and the rest look after them. If you can get to the final 10-12km and Wiggins is still there, that is where he can go on the attack.' To get to that point, Team Sky will need to be in survival mode in a usually attritional race known as 'the Hell of the North'. The brutal cobbled stretches, which require huge amounts of effort while increasing the chances of crashes and mechanical problems, create a nervousness in the peloton which makes planning all but impossible. Although Kelly never won the Tour of Flanders, finishing second in 1984, he was victorious in Paris-Roubaix twice, 1984 and 1986, and said the fear of the cobbles is something that never really left him. 'When I first went there I had a horrendous time - I was very nervous on the cobbles and I wasn't able to ride them well,' he said. 'I slowly developed and I was able to manage to ride them, but even when I got to the point of being a Paris-Roubaix favourite it's still very nervous times. 'It's a horrible race to ride, but a great race to win.'

Team Sky have never won one of cycling's five Monument races. The Tour of Flanders takes place next weekend with Ian Stannard and Geraint Thomas contenders fro Team Sky. Sean Kelly has backed them to finally break their duck.

Article: Fabio Capello claimed John Terry is still England’s best defender and maintained he should never have been stripped of his captaincy. Speaking about the Terry race row for the first time since leaving his post as England manager, Capello said England would be in a much stronger position if they still had the Chelsea stalwart at their disposal. ‘I think John is England’s best defender and they have not got a lot of defenders,’ said Capello, ‘It is better to have a player like John than not have him.’ Fabio Capello insists defender John Terry should never have been stripped of the England captaincy. Capello claims England would be in a much stronger position if they still had the Chelsea star at their disposal. The Italian was in charge of the national side when Terry was accused of racially abusing Anton Ferdinand, the brother of then England teammate Rio, during a Chelsea match against QPR in October 2011. He was stripped of his captaincy by the Football Association after being charged by police. Capello resigned as England Manager in February 2012 just two days after publicly criticising the FA’s decision and obviously remains bitter about the whole affair. He believes Terry should have kept his role under the presumption of innocence until guilt is proven. ‘I fought for John to be able to come back and play but they [the Football Association] said “no you can’t decide about the player, you need to wait for the court decision,” and I said “Why?” But they had already decided before I asked. John Terry was caught up in a race controversy with then-QPR defender Anton Ferdinand in 2011. Chelsea captain Terry, who has 78 England caps, retired from international football in September 2012. Asked if it was time to persuade Terry, who has been a permanent fixture in the Chelsea side bound for the Premier League title, to come back into the England fold, Capello - speaking at the Laureus World Sports Awards - directed his ire at the FA. ‘You know what happened with me, they decided he could not play with the national team and I didn’t understand because he was not guilty. ‘When it happened I said to the President [David Bernstein] “You decided he’s guilty?” No he’s not guilty, it’s good you can play with the national team and I don’t understand why you don’t play.’ Terry was cleared of racially abusing Ferdinand in a criminal hearing at Westminster Magistrates Court but retired from international football in September 2012 after the FA pursued their own charges. An FA hearing found Terry, who has 78 England caps, guilty of using insulting words which included a reference to Anton Ferdinand’s colour or race and he was banned for four matches and fined £220,000,. Terry, 34, said he was ‘deeply hurt’ by the incident and will never play for England again. Capello agreed his international career was probably over. ‘I don’t think he has the chances to play with the national team more,’ said Capello, ‘But I saw some young players that played with me are improving. [Chris] Smalling is playing and [Phil] Jones. I’m happy because a lot of players I put in the national team are playing now and well.’ The Chelsea defender was cleared in court of racially abusing Ferdinand but was banned and fined by the FA.

In a broadcast career spanning more than five decades, he was instrumental in establishing one-day cricket on television. Such was influence, his dry one-liners and impeccable delivery - including one simple word'marvellous' - were adopted as part of the Australian lexicon. Former Australian spin bowler Shane Warne penned a heartfelt tribute on social media calling him the 'Godfather of cricket'. 'As a cricketer, commentator and as a person, you were the best there's ever been,' he wrote in a note to Benaud. 'For me it was an honour and a privilege to call you a close friend and mentor. 'We had so many wonderful times together, talking cricket and in particular, our love and passion of leg spin bowling. Former  captain Richie Benaud stands by a sculpture of himself at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 2008. Floral tributes have started to gather at the bronze statue of Richie Benaud at the Sydney Cricket Ground. The flags at the Sydney Cricket Ground were flying at half mast on Friday following Benaud's death. As a player, Benaud was a trailblazing all-rounder who took 248 wickets and scored 2,201 runs in 63 Tests while never losing a series in charge of his country. He enjoyed a remarkable Test career as a wily leg-spin bowler and middle-order batsman which ended with his retirement in 1964. Benaud scored three Test centuries and once hit 11 sixes in a first class innings. After retiring, Benaud became a commentary icon initially with the BBC in England and later in his native Australia. In a broadcast career spanning more than five decades, he was instrumental in establishing one-day cricket on television. Such was influence, his dry one-liners and impeccable delivery - including one simple word'marvellous' - were adopted as part of the Australian lexicon. He was the mainstay in Australian cricket television commentary until the past two summers - a car accident in 2013 sidelined him before he announced in November last year he had skin cancer. At the time of his death, Benaud had witnessed - as both player and commentator - well over 500 Test matches. Benaud was born in Penrith in western Sydney in October 1930. Warne also thanked Benaud for the support he gave to him as a young cricketer. 'Richie, you were loved by everyone, not just the cricket family, you were the godfather of cricket and you will be missed by all.' Australian Test captain Michael Clarke said Benaud was a gentleman who played cricket in the right spirit. 'He was a great player and a great captain; a wonderful leader of men and he continued that off the field,' Clarke told the Nine Network. 'Our country has lost a national treasure,' Cricket Australia chairman Wally Edwards said in a statement on Friday. 'After Don Bradman, there has been no Australian player more famous or more influential than Richie Benaud.' 'He loved winning. He helped the Australian team have the attitude where they wanted to win. He played the game the right way. 'There's no doubt he's certainly going to be missed.' Prime Minister David Cameron said: 'I grew up listening to Richie Benaud's wonderful cricket commentary. Like all fans of the sport, I will miss him very much.' Former Australian fast bowler Brett Lee said: 'When Richie walks into the Channel Nine box everyone stands up. 'When Richie was on, you'd see all the commentators listening in to see what Richie had to say. 'A lot of children growing up know him as a commentator but he's a great cricketer in his own right.' Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has offered Richie Benaud's family a state funeral following his death. Benaud was one of the world's most recognised commentators having initially started with the BBC in England before anchoring the Nine Network's cricket coverage in Australia for decades. A veteran of 63 Test matches, Benaud played a pivotal role in the formation of World Series Cricket in the 1970s and was one of the world's most recognised commentators. Benaud was the face and voice of cricket, much admired, much imitated, and in his later years  a cult figure. Former Prime Minister John Howard greeted Richie Benaud at the Sydney Cricket Ground back in 2001. Benaud and ex-Hampshire cricket captain and TV presenter Richie Benaud pictured here at Sophia Gardens in Cardiff during the first England v Australia Test match in 2009. 'There would hardly be an Australian over the last 40 years who hasn't listened to Richie Benaud,' he told ABC radio on Friday. 'He certainly will be very, very much missed.' Benaud had anchored the Nine Network's cricket coverage in Australia for decades. 'Richie Benaud's passing has robbed us not only of a national treasure but a lovely man,' Nine Network CEO David Gyngell said in a statement. 'Richie earned the profound and lasting respect of everyone across the world of cricket and beyond. First as an outstanding player and captain, then as an incomparable commentator and through it all, as a wonderful human being.' The cricket commentator had been receiving radiation treatment for skin cancer since November when he was admitted to a Sydney hospice on Thursday. Richie Benaud married his wife Daphne in July 1967. At the time of his death in Sydney overnight Benaud had witnessed - as both player and commentator - well over 500 Test matches. Benaud was born in Penrith in western Sydney in October 1930. He enjoyed a remarkable Test career as a wily leg-spin bowler and middle-order batsman which ended with his retirement in 1964. Benaud was the first player to score 2,000 Test runs and take 200 Test wickets yet was as much renowned for his captaincy - he never lost a Test series as Australian captain. After retiring, Benaud became a commentary icon initially with the BBC in England and later in his native Australia. He was the mainstay in Australian cricket television commentary until the past two summers - a car accident in 2013 sidelined him before he announced in November last year he had skin cancer. As a player, Benaud appeared in 63 Test matches between 1951 and 1963, becoming the first man from any nation to score 2000 Test runs and take 200 Test wickets. He enjoyed a remarkable Test career as a wily leg-spin bowler and middle-order batsman which ended with his retirement in 1964. Penrith-born Benaud enjoyed a remarkable Test career as a wily leg-spin bowler and middle-order batsman which ended with his retirement in 1964. 'When I was a kid we never ever wore a cap... because Keith Miller never wore a cap,'Benaud said at the time. 'If I knew, when I was at school and playing in my early cricket days, the problems that would have come if I didn't do something about protection of the head and using sunscreens and all sorts of things like that, I'd have played it differently. 'It's one of those things in life: you live and learn as you go along.' Benaud did, however, manage to voice a touching tribute to Phillip Hughes, who died when struck by a bouncer last November, which was screened before Australia's Test series against India last December. Hundreds of admirers dressed up as the legendary commentator during the Sydney Ashes Test of 2014 when Benaud lay in hospital with complications from a serious car accident some months earlier. Benaud was the mainstay in Australian cricket television commentary with crowd members even dressing up as him as he became something of a cult figure in his later years. As a player, Benaud appeared in 63 Test matches between 1951 and 1963, becoming the first man from any nation to score 2000 Test runs and take 200 Test wickets. His Australian record Test tally of 248 wickets has since been overtaken by many, most notably fellow legspinner Shane Warne, whose career tally of 708 was unimaginable in Benaud's day. Benaud scored three Test centuries and once hit 11 sixes in a first class innings. Shane Warne penned a heartfelt tribute to Richie Benaud on social media on Friday. As captain he led Australia to four consecutive series victories, beginning with a 4-0 demolition of Peter May's 1958-59 tourists (Benaud took 31 wickets in the five tests). He never lost a series as captain. The Nine Network will air a special on the life of cricketing great Richie Benaud on Saturday night at 7pm. Nine will screen Richie Benaud: A Marvellous Life 1930-2015 about the public, private and cricketing achievements of the former Australian cricket captain and legendary commentator.

Article: Huddersfield ensured their status in the Sky Bet Championship with three games remaining thanks to a goalless draw at Brighton. The point for the Seagulls ended a run of three successive defeats, but their goal drought continues and they are now without a goal from one of their own players for nine hours and 20 minutes. Albion are still not out of danger towards the bottom of the table and are seven points above the drop zone with three games left. Brighton's Beram Kayal (left) and Huddersfield's Jacob Butterfield battle for the ball at the Amex Stadium. Mustapha Carayol (right) attempts to get away from Tommy Smith as the hosts go on the attack. Birmingham's highly-rated winger Demarai Gray was on target for the second successive game as his strike rescued a point in City's 2-2 draw against Blackburn at St Andrew's. The hosts twice came from behind to salvage a share of the spoils in the Sky Bet Championship fixture with Gray following up his winner against Wolves last weekend with another classy piece of finishing in the 78th minute. Blackburn captain Matt Kilgallon had put Rovers ahead after just eight minutes with his first goal in over a year. A stirring second-half fight back from Birmingham saw them draw level when full-back Jonathan Grounds grabbed a 64th-minute equaliser. The ever reliable Jordan Rhodes looked to have earned Blackburn only their second win in their last five Championship games with his 18th goal of the season four minutes later. Birmingham City's Jonathan Grounds heads home his side's first goal against Blackburn Rovers. Demarai Gray nets Birmingham's second equaliser during their 2-2 at St Andrew's on Tuesday night. But Gray popped up to ensure Birmingham extended their unbeaten home record to seven games, while Rovers have now not been beaten in eight league and cup matches on the road. Adam Le Fondre's seventh goal of the season rescued a point for Bolton and ensured Charlton's third successive SkyBet Championship draw. The on-loan Cardiff marksman netted for a second successive game after 78 minutes when it seemed Charlton were comfortably protecting Frederic Bulot's ninth-minute opener. Wanderers had goalkeeper Adam Bogdan to thank for keeping it at 1-0 before Le Fondre drew level with Craig Davies at the head of the Trotters' goal charts to salvage a 1-1 draw for Neil Lennon's men. Charlton's Frederic Bulot celebrates with his manager Guy Luzon after opening the scoring against Bolton. Bolton striker Adam Le Fondre raises his arm as he celebrates netting an equaliser in the 79th minute.

Article: (CNN)That's some rich "American Pie." The lyrics to the famed Don McLean song sold for $1.2 million Tuesday morning at an auction held by Christie's. "Don McLean's manuscript of 'American Pie' achieved the 3rd highest auction price for an American literary manuscript, a fitting tribute to one the foremost singer-songwriters of his generation," Christie's Tom Lecky said in a statement. McLean told Rolling Stone that it was time to part with the manuscript. "I'm going to be 70 this year," the singer and songwriter said in February. "I have two children and a wife, and none of them seem to have the mercantile instinct. I want to get the best deal that I can for them. It's time." Over the years, "American Pie" has become one of the most dissected and argued-about songs in the pop music canon. McLean has said that the opening lines were inspired by the death of Buddy Holly, but after that, it's all been conjecture -- which hasn't stopped a marching band's worth of analysts from trying to parse the symbols in the 8-minute, 33-second opus. Is the jester Bob Dylan? The football game Vietnam? The "girl who sang the blues" Janis Joplin? (One thing's certain: Buddy Holly's plane was NOT named "American Pie.") "Over the years I've dealt with all these stupid questions of 'Who's that?' and 'Who's that?' " McLean said. "These are things I never had in my head for a second when I wrote the song. I was trying to capture something very ephemeral and I did, but it took a long time." The song catapulted the former folk singer to headliner status. The song hit No. 1 in early 1972, despite its length. (The 45-rpm single split the song in half on its A and B sides.) The draft that was auctioned is 16 pages: 237 lines of manuscript and 26 lines of typed text, according to Christie's. It includes lines that didn't make the final version as well as extensive notes -- all of which should be revealing, McLean said. The record for a popular music manuscript is held by Bob Dylan's "Like a Rolling Stone," which sold for $2 million in June. Opinion: What's so great about 'American Pie'?

Article: A woman who suffered stomach cramps and bleeding for two years was horrified to be told it was due to a tumour the size of a golf ball in her cervix. Kerry Hamilton was finally diagnosed with leiomyosarcoma, a rare cancer of the soft tissue normally found in women over 50. At just 34, she was forced to undergo a hysterectomy and was devastated at the thought of not being able to have children. She now wants to raise awareness about rare cancers like leiomyosarcoma, so that other women with seemingly 'everyday' symptoms like cramps visit their GP. Kerry Hamilton, 34, had stomach cramps, bleeding and irregular periods for two years. Doctors finally discovered she had a tumour the size of a golf ball growing in her cervix. Ms Hamilton, an education consultant, began experiencing odd symptoms in 2009, when she flew to South Africa to volunteer at a lion research centre for a month (pictured) Since her time in South Africa (pictured) she had experienced spotting in between her periods, longer periods than normal and stomach cramps. Ms Hamilton, from Birmingham, said: 'I'm on a bid to raise awareness about rare cancers and the symptoms that people might ignore - without realising that it is important to listen to their body. 'The kind of cancer I had - despite it being in my cervix - would not have showed up on a smear test. 'So it's important to visit your GP if you're concerned about anything, as well as always going for routine tests.' Ms Hamilton, an education consultant, began experiencing odd symptoms in 2009, when she flew to South Africa to volunteer at a lion research centre for a month. A week before she was due to fly home she fell violently ill with stomach cramps. She spent seven days in hospital where a local doctor told her that she was suffering with a cyst on her ovaries that had burst. Leiomyosarcomas are cancers that develop in a type of muscle tissue called smooth muscle. These muscles are found in the walls of muscular organs like the heart and the stomach. They are rare and usually only affect people over the age of 50, but they can start anywhere in the body. They most commonly start in the walls of the womb, the limbs and the digestive system. People with early leiomyosarcoma often have no symptoms. Possible. symptoms to develop as the cancer advances include a lump or swelling,. abdominal bloating, swelling or pain and a change in menstruation. Source: Macmillan Cancer Support. Over the next two years she returned to the park to work as a guide and a ranger and later returned to the UK where she started working as an educational consultant. When she returned, she went for a routine smear test in 2011 and was given the all clear. Ever since being hospitalised in South Africa she had experienced spotting in between her periods, longer periods than normal and stomach cramps. By last summer these symptoms had become worse and intense pain and lots of bleeding. Her GP suggested it was a hormonal problem and that she go on the contraceptive pill to try and control it. But as she was single, Ms Hamilton didn't see the point of using a contraceptive and felt uneasy about taking hormonal treatment. She also didn't want to ignore the signals her body was giving her, and so never took the contraceptives that were prescribed. It was only in January this year, when she was called for her next smear test, that she was finally diagnosed. The nurse due to carry out the smear said her cervix was so irritated that it was impossible to conduct the test. Ms Hamilton, pictured in 2009, became aware something was seriously wrong when a nurse couldn't perform a smear test on her as there was so much inflammation. Doctors diagnosed Ms Hamilton with a leiomyosarcoma  - a cancer of the soft tissue, the muscle, fat, blood vessels, or any of the other tissues that support, surround and protect the organs of the body. She then broke the devastating news that she suspected Ms Hamilton had cancer. After an MRI scan, doctors confirmed she had leiomyosarcoma and would need a hysterectomy to save her life. A leiomyosarcoma is a cancer of the soft tissue, the muscle, fat, blood vessels, or any of the other tissues that support, surround and protect the organs of the body. Ms Hamilton's was found in the walls of her cervix. Only about 3,300 new cases of soft tissue cancers are diagnosed each year in the UK, and they mainly affect people over the age of 50. Ms Hamilton described the shock of being told she may never be able to become pregnant naturally. 'This was going to be the year I was going to go out and meet someone and start to think about having a family. 'But now I wouldn't be able to carry a child. 'I couldn't believe that I had cancer in my cervix for all that time.' Ms Hamilton underwent a hysterectomy at just 34-and was devastated at the thought of not being able to carry a child. But she remained positive, saying 'there is somebody else going through much worse' She underwent egg collection so that one day she might have a child that is biologically hers. On March 19th this year she underwent the operation to remove her womb – and the tumour – and is now recovering at home. While many women would become disheartened after such an ordeal, Ms Hamilton said she believes. She said: 'Luckily I am a naturally positive person, and I just think that there is somebody else going through something much worse than me. 'When I was finally diagnosed it was more of a relief than anything to know what was wrong. 'It was when I was told that I would need a hysterectomy that when it hit me, and I became really upset.' Even before she had cancer, Ms Hamilton ran the Race for Life for Cancer Research UK, and this year raising money for the charity will be more meaningful than ever. She said: 'I have done the race the last two years, and I always said I would do it every year, so this year I'm on a mission. 'I've already raised £1,600 which is so amazing and humbling.'

Article: Celtic have announced that they are to erect a bronze statue of Billy McNeill to mark the magnificent achievements of the club's greatest ever captain. The statue will be positioned on the recently opened Celtic Way and will represent a man who is synonymous with the club and someone who represented them with true distinction as both a player and manager. As a player, McNeill won nine consecutive league championship titles, seven Scottish Cups, six League Cups and, of course, he was the first British team captain to lift the European Cup in 1967. Celtic legend BIlly McNeill poses with the European Cup to commemorate the club's famous 1967 victory. He was named the Scottish Footballer of the Year in season 1964-65, the first ever winner of the award. As manager, McNeill delivered four league championship titles, three Scottish Cups and he lifted the League Cup once. As both player and manager, he enjoyed a 27-year association with Celtic Football Club. Fittingly, the work on the statue will be carried out by John McKenna, the sculptor who recently completed the statue of Jock Stein which sits at the entrance to Celtic Park. Work on the statue of McNeill will begin immediately and it is hoped that the completed work will be unveiled at Celtic Park later this year, around Autumn. McNeill (right) has a shot blocked by Leeds United midfielder Paul Madeley (left) Celtic Chief Executive Peter Lawwell said: 'Growing up in the 1960s and 1970s as a Celtic supporter, Billy McNeill was an inspiration to me and someone of huge stature in the game, not only on the field but also off it, as a statesman, a leader and a figurehead for our great club. 'His achievements for Celtic are simply outstanding and across a period of 27 years he gave so much to the club. 'It is a privilege to now know Billy, and consider him as a friend. He is someone who commands the respect of everyone across the entire footballing spectrum. 'We are delighted already to have Billy as our Ambassador at the club but the Board felt unanimously that he should recognised in this way, given all that he has contributed to Celtic over so many years. 'We look forward to the unveiling of the statue, which we are sure will be a great tribute to a great man.' McNeill himself said: 'When Peter contacted me regarding the statue I was completely taken by surprise. 'Whenever I walk up the Celtic Way, I look on with a great sense of pride at the sight of Brother Walfrid, Big Jock and my old team-mate and friend Jinky rightly taking their place almost as guardians of Celtic Park. 'Every time I look back at this special club's history and what we achieved it fills me with joy, and now to be told I am to be honoured beside these Celtic greats, this really is a special day for me and all my family.' Following the 2-1 win over Inter Milan in the final, McNeill holds the European Cup above his head.

Article: (CNN)You may know Mindy Kaling from Fox's cult hit comedy "The Mindy Project," in which she plays Mindy Lahiri, a perky, quirky OB/GYN juggling her career and love life in New York. (Only in the Big Apple can a doctor not afford an apartment!) The show was a breakthrough for on-screen representation — the first network sitcom created by and starring a woman of color — and it looks likely to be renewed for the coming 2015-16 season. Recently, however, Kaling's brother Vijay Chokalingam unveiled a project of his own, and while it has been getting a lot of attention, it hasn't generated quite as many laughs — either from observers or from his famous sibling, who told him it brought "shame upon their family." You see, Chokalingam revealed that, as an undergraduate at the University of Chicago, he engaged in a daring (his view) or ridiculous and offensive (pretty much everyone else) scam: He applied to medical school claiming to be African-American. Chokalingam had spent his college years as a "hard-partying frat boy," and achieved a less than stunning 3.1 GPA. Upon facing graduation and exploring his med school options, he realized that fellow Indian-Americans with his grades were getting turned down from the universities of his choice — but that "black, Hispanic, and Native American applicants with my grades and test scores were much more likely to gain acceptance." This revelation led him to make the decision to pose as a black man, both to "dramatically improve" his chances of admission, and to illustrate the unfair advantage that blacks and other underrepresented minorities receive when applying to prestigious schools. To accomplish this goal, Chokalingam shaved his head of its naturally wavy black locks, trimmed his "long Indian-American eyelashes," checked "black" under the optional race/ethnicity declaration and submitted his application to 14 schools under his childhood nickname "JoJo." He received invitations for in-person interviews at 11 schools, results that he claims support the notion that African-Americans garner special privileges that are unavailable to whites or Asians. And now that the statute of limitations on his act of fraud has expired, he's looking to write a book on his experiences, titled "Almost Black: The True Story of an Indian American Who Got Into Medical School Pretending to Be an African American." What's truly curious is that even if you agree with Chokalingam that affirmative action is merely a form of "systematic racism," when all is said and done, it offers very little evidence of the "privilege" that he claims is accorded to black, Hispanic and Native American candidates. Chokalingam had mediocre grades and MCATs, but he graduated from one of the most prestigious schools in the nation. Yet even while representing himself as black, Chokalingam received only a single admission offer, to St. Louis University's School of Medicine, which falls somewhere between 57th and 67th in national rankings. Harvard, University of Pennsylvania, Columbia and all the higher ranked schools he applied to rejected him. Meanwhile, he admits, pretending to be black came with disadvantages. He found himself being accused of shoplifting by store clerks and harassed by cops — who would regularly stop him while driving and demand that he tell them how much his car cost, implying that he must have stolen it. These acts of very real prejudice, experienced regularly by blacks and Hispanics of all backgrounds — multimillionaire comedian Chris Rock has recently been tweeting pictures of the occasions when he is pulled over by police for no reason — didn't seem to dissuade Chokalingam from his adamant belief in the unfairness of a system that seeks to address the shockingly low numbers of minority health practitioners by providing some weight to race and ethnicity in decision-making. It's not just a matter of what individual applicants "deserve." One-third of Americans are black, Hispanic or Native American; just one in 10 physicians are. Since minority medical practitioners are up to three times as likely to practice in their own communities, this lack of diversity has produced "doctor deserts," in which urban and rural ethnic enclaves across the nation go without access to primary care physicians. Years ago, when I told my father — a doctor from a long line of doctors — that I didn't want to follow in his footsteps, he told me that was fine, because medicine is a service trade, and anyone not interested in serving should avoid the profession. A medical degree isn't a reward to be earned, he said, but a responsibility to be accepted. Which really cuts to the heart of what's so sad about Chokalingam's racial farce. Like others who've recently been exposed for falsely claiming racial identities — including putative presidential candidate Jeb Bush, who registered himself as "Hispanic" on a 2009 voter form, and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who was excoriated during her campaign for having claimed Native American ancestry in the past — Chokalingam wanted to claim the fruits of racial affiliation without having to carry black people's burden. Race isn't just about color or blood; it is about the collective experiences and inherited cultural context and present-day condition of a community of people. Many of the markers of race are persistently corrosive; others are deeply painful. Affirmative action programs are a means of redress for these awful realities of our nation's history; an imperfect one, but necessary. There are some fields where the imbalances might never correct themselves on their own. Industries like health care and Hollywood. Because what's most ironic about Chokalingam's decision to ride on his sister's coattails in telling his story: While Asians are well represented in medicine, our numbers are vanishingly low in the entertainment and media world, and until the recent breakthrough of modern pioneers like Mindy Kaling, it was impossible to imagine film and television that included our faces, voices and stories. Kaling's immense talent and charisma made her a star. But it was a quota-based affirmative action initiative -- NBC's Diversity Writers Program -- that gave her a start.

Article: Hibs, Hearts and Rangers united in condemnation of the SPFL's decision to move the Ibrox club's final game of the Championship season back 24 hours. In a move designed to accommodate broadcasters, Rangers will face champions Hearts at Tynecastle on May 3 — 24 hours after Hibs and promotion rivals Falkirk and Queen of the South play. Adamant the final round of fixtures should be played at the same time to avert any competitive advantage for Stuart McCall's side, Easter Road chief executive Leanne Dempster and Hearts chairwoman Ann Budge have lodged formal complaints with the league. In a staggering misjudgment of the public mood, however, the SPFL issued a statement expressing surprise at the fuss before Rangers boss McCall compounded their woe by revealing he also backed Hibs' stance. Hibernian are upset that Rangers' final game of the season has been pushed back for TV purposes. Ramping up the pressure on SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster, Hibs counterpart Leanne Dempster said: 'In previous seasons, the League has ensured that all of the final round fixtures are played at the same time. 'I have been in contact with the SPFL following its announcement that one final-round fixture would kick off after all the other results are known. 'I have reminded them in very clear terms that — as organisers of the competition — the responsibility for protecting its unimpeachable sporting integrity lies with them.' On a day when the relationship between broadcasters and Scottish football came under unprecedented scrutiny, Hearts majority shareholder Budge backed up her city rivals. In a statement, Budge also queried the'sporting integrity' of Rangers playing 24 hours after their rivals given they are engaged in a dogfight with Hibs for second place. 'This has been done following selection of the game for a live TV broadcast,' she said. 'While we all knew that this was likely to be a strong candidate for televising and that the time might well change, we did not for one minute think that at this late stage, it would be moved to the Sunday, especially given our belief that all Championship games would require to be played at the same time. 'On learning of the change, I immediately attempted to contact the SPFL and objected in strong terms to the proposed late change to this fixture on the grounds of it having a total disregard for the interests of supporters of both clubs and an apparent disregard for sporting integrity. Rangers will play Hearts at Tynecastle in their final game of the season on May 3. 'Being given 17 days' notice of this change is extremely disruptive and potentially very expensive for the fans, the sponsors and indeed the club. Overseas supporters have been in touch to advise that they will lose substantial amounts on travel; others have advised of lost earnings, holiday problems, etc. 'None of this is good for any of us and on behalf of the club, I can only apologise. 'When it also became apparent to us that our fixture was the only game to be moved, we were equally alarmed as rightly or wrongly, this casts a shadow over the sporting integrity of the Championship. 'While it may not be enshrined in the newly-merged rulebook of the SPFL, it is protocol the football world over for fixtures such as the last day of the Championship to be played simultaneously. 'To move only one, (or even two or four) out of 5 fixtures would seem to be leaving our game wide open to unsavoury accusations. 'I will be sending in a formal complaint to the SPFL in relation to this appallingly late decision. It is no wonder that clubs are finding it harder and harder to gain support from their fans when their interests can be so blatantly disregarded, especially at such short notice. 'I am advised that this complaint will likely have no impact on the original decision but nevertheless, I want our supporters to know that we have taken all and any action that we could have and I will further comment on the situation once we have been updated by the League.' Responding to the criticism, however, the SPFL rushed out a statement saying it was 'unreasonable' to expect all Championship games to kick off simultaneously. 'In response to recent criticisms of the Championship fixture scheduling for the weekend 2/3 May, we'd like to clarify some specific points. On this weekend, the Hearts v Rangers match is scheduled for Sunday 3 May to be broadcast on television and it is not clear to us why this has caused so much surprise. This is a key game in the Championship season and will inevitably attract huge interest from fans around the world. Hearts are already promoted from the Championship, but they too condemned the fixture change. 'It is unreasonable to expect all Championship fixtures that weekend to move to the Sunday when a number of them will be unaffected by the Hearts v Rangers tie. However, as a result of this fixture, all Championship clubs have been invited to submit a request should they wish to move games to the Sunday. 'To date, we have had no request from Hibernian FC to move its fixture to the Sunday at the time of writing (8.45pm, Wednesday 15 April). 'We also note speculation that Police Scotland expressed concern to the SPFL about the scheduling of the Hearts v Rangers match. However, Police Scotland confirmed to us that there were no security issues with the scheduling of all Championship fixtures that weekend. 'Whilst we regret any inconvenience to supporters caused by rescheduled fixtures, the circumstances surrounding the matches on the weekend of 2/3 May are in no way unusual.' After his side drew with Livingston last night, however, Ibrox manager McCall gave his view, saying: 'First and foremost, we've not asked for the game to be changed. Hibs are complaining about it and rightly so. I'd be doing exactly the same. I think every game on the last day of the season should be played at the same time. 'But we've told by the TV, I believe, that it may be the case that the other games are moved to the Sunday. I honestly don't know. It's nothing to do with us. We've not asked for that, but if I was in Hibs' position then, yes, I would be annoyed as well. Of course. 'I was happy to play on the Saturday. We've not tried to gain any advantage - we've been told when to play. TV controls a lot of things. If the game definitely has to go ahead on the Sunday then can we all then move to the Sunday. I'd be happy with that. I would imagine that it will be changed over the next 24 or 48 hours to play at the same time. It would be only right.'

Article: Ultimately, Bristol City were never destined to become the first Football League club to win promotion this season at Deepdale, even though they are inching ever closer. Swindon’s win over Peterborough meant Steve Cotterill will have to wait until Tuesday to finish the job of returning to the Championship, but almost as importantly they made sure Preston wouldn’t make any ground on them in the top two. Three points at Bradford on Tuesday will do the trick - only that standing in their way now. It would take something to go seriously awry for the Robins not to be returning to the second tier after a two-year absence, and they did their job well enough to prevent any late scares in the north west. Bristol City striker Aaron Wilbraham celebrates his 63rd minute goal against Preston at Deepdale. Preston (3-5-2): Johnstone; Clarke, King, Wright; Humphrey (Wiseman 84), Welsh, Johnson, Gallagher, Laird; Beckford (Davies 90), Garner (Robinson 84) Subs not used: Stuckmann, Kilkenny, Woods, Little. Bristol City (3-5-2): Fielding, Ayling, Flint, Williams; Tavernier, K.Smith, Pack, Freeman (Elliott 90), Bryan; Agard (Emmanuel-Thomas 82), Wilbraham. Subs not used: Richards, Cunningham, Osborne, Saville, Wagstaff. A six-minute rendition of ‘F*** off Swindon Town, you are staying down’ rang out of the gleeful away end at Deepdale - populated by 2,400 - as that return got ever closer. City had dispensed of their rivals on Tuesday night, hammering them 3-0, and took great delight in revelling in their triumph. It was an afternoon whereby neither side played with any nerves - there are reasons why these two occupy the automatic promotion places - although lacking a fluidity you would perhaps expect. There was an illusion of this being an open game, but the two five-man midfields shattered that. Jermaine Beckford came closest for the hosts, his smart overhead kick just flying wide, while the out of sorts Daniel Johnson blasted way over. Joe Garner felt he should’ve been awarded a penalty after being clattered by Frank Fielding. Steve Cotterill, knowing results elsewhere dictated they could still clinch elevation by five o’clock, clearly put a rocket up his free scorers at the break. Before then they had threatened from free-kicks, managed to get into decent positions, but didn’t threaten nearly enough. Wilbraham got on the end of James Tavernier’s wicked cross from the right, but his shot was superbly tipped onto the bar by Sam Johnstone. Kieran Agard failed to stretch far enough to convert from two yards shortly afterwards. Preston were on the ropes, their biggest crowd in two years growing restless immediately after half-time. That was until Jermaine Beckford popped up, five yards out, to send Deepdale delirious just before the hour mark. Paul Gallagher picked up on lapse defending to take control of the situation inside the away box, firing across goal for Beckford to sweep beyond Fielding. At that stage, it took Simon Grayson’s side seven points ahead of MK Dons - drawing at Port Vale - in third. But they only managed to hold the lead for four minutes, Aden Flint intelligently flicking a header towards the middle of the six-yard box for Wilbraham to power home in front of the travelling band from the West Country, his 20th of the season. Grayson will be frustrated at the way in which his side switched off from a routine set piece. This could’ve been a day they made the title race very interesting indeed. As it was, Agard forced Johnstone into another decent save, diving down to his right to tip wide on the angle, as Cotterill’s side searched for a winner. That did not come, despite substitute Jay Emmanuel-Thomas’ best efforts. The ice is stored away, but not for long.

Second-placed Preston hosted League One leaders Bristol City. Jermaine Beckford fired the home side into the lead in the 59th minute. Aaron Wilbraham equalised for Bristol City four minutes later.

Article: Robin van Persie has declared himself fit for Sunday's Manchester derby. Van Persie has missed Manchester United's last six games following an ankle injury he suffered in the 2-1 defeat at Swansea on February 21. Manager Louis van Gaal said last week he did not expect the striker to be fit enough to return for Sunday's game against Manchester City at Old Trafford, but Van Persie reported good news for United fans on Wednesday. Robin van Persie has declared himself fit for the Manchester derby after missing United's last six games. Louis van Gaal will be pleased to have Van Persie back but he is unlikely to start the game. The 31-year-old tweeted: 'Back to training with the group today. Was a great session. Happy to be fit and able to play again. Looking forward to my next game!' Even if Van Gaal considers Van Persie to be fit to take part in the derby, it is hard to see how the former Arsenal front man would fit into the starting XI. United have hardly missed the Dutchman, who has scored just 10 goals this term. During his absence, the Red Devils have only lost once - against his former employers Arsenal in the FA Cup. United have recorded creditable victories over Tottenham and Liverpool and last Saturday they moved above City into third with a 3-1 win over Aston Villa. Wayne Rooney scored a stunning volley during the win. The United skipper has performed well up front in a 4-3-3 formation alongside Ashley Young and Juan Mata, who scored both goals in the 2-1 win at Anfield two-and-a-half weeks ago. Marouane Fellaini has also provided able and robust support from midfield. Wayne Rooney celebrates with Radamel Falcao after scoring against Aston Villa at the weekend. Victory for United this weekend would pile more misery on out-of-form City and improve Van Gaal's chances of achieving his target of Champions League qualification. Once he returns from his summer break, he is likely to take United on a shortened pre-season tour, with the most likely destination the United States, it has emerged. Van Gaal made no secret of his annoyance at United's pre-season schedule last summer. United had already committed themselves to a three-week long tour that took in five matches across five American cities by the time Van Gaal took over as manager. United travelled almost 13,500 miles on the trip, which included games in Los Angeles, Denver, Detroit, Washington DC and Miami - all against high-profile opposition. This summer's tour is expected to see United take on fewer opponents and undertake less travel. The trip will have to be over a shorter period of time too as the Premier League season begins on August 8 - just eight weeks after the end of the international break. It is understood that Van Gaal will sign off plans for the tour in the coming weeks.

Article: (CNN)Buzz has surrounded HBO's new documentary "Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief," but Scientologist John Travolta is not a fan. Travolta told the Tampa Bay Times that he has not seen the documentary, "and I don't really care to." "I've been so happy with my (Scientology) experience in the last 40 years that I really don't have anything to say that would shed light on (a documentary) so decidedly negative," Travolta said. The actor, one of the Church of Scientology's most high-profile members along with stars like Tom Cruise and Kirstie Alley, is premiering his new film, "The Forger," in Clearwater, Florida. The HBO documentary is based on the book "Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief" by Lawrence Wright and is critical of the organization, which has close ties to the showbiz industry. Travolta said he believed the doc was a result of "people who were disgruntled with their experiences" with the Church of Scientology, which he touted as a positive experience for him. "I haven't experienced anything that the hearsay has (claimed), so why would I communicate something that wasn't true for me?" Travolta asked. "It wouldn't make sense, nor would it for Tom (Cruise), I imagine." He called Scientology "brilliant" and credited the church with helping him to survive the death of his teen son, Jett, after a seizure while the family was on vacation in the Bahamas in 2009. "Oh, my God, I wouldn't have made it," said Travolta, whose wife, Kelly Preston, is also a member. "Honestly."
