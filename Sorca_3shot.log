Question: Jimin's school uses 7000 liters (l) of water per day. Find how many days it will take for the water used at Jimin's school to reach 100000 liters (l).
Answer: To find out how many days it will take for the water used at Jimin's school to reach 100,000 liters, we need to divide the total amount of water to be used by the amount of water used per day.

Total amount of water to be used: 100,000 liters
Amount of water used per day: 7,000 liters

Number of days = Total amount of water to be used / Amount of water used per day
Number of days = 100,000 liters / 7,000 liters per day
Number of days = 14.2857 days

Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we'll round up to the nearest whole day. Therefore, it will take 15 days for the water used at Jimin's school to reach 100,000 liters.
Question: Using the four digits 1, 5, 6, and 9 once, find the largest three-digit number with hundreds digit of 1.
Answer: To find the largest three-digit number with the hundreds digit of 1, we need to arrange the remaining digits (5, 6, and 9) in descending order for the tens and units places.

So, the largest digit among 5, 6, and 9 is 9, which we will place in the tens place. The next largest digit is 6, which we will place in the units place.

Therefore, the largest three-digit number with the hundreds digit of 1 is 196.

Question: There are fifteen pieces of square-shaped colored paper with a side length of 25 centimeters (cm) glued together. Given that they were overlapped by 0.5 centimeters (cm) to connect them having a maximum length of one side of the paper, find its length in meters (m).
Answer: To find the total length of the paper, we need to consider the overlap between each piece of paper. Since each piece of paper is 25 cm in length and they overlap by 0.5 cm, the effective length added by each additional piece of paper is 25 cm - 0.5 cm.

For the first piece of paper, we have the full length of 25 cm. For each subsequent piece, we add 24.5 cm (since 0.5 cm is overlapped).

With 15 pieces of paper, we have one full piece and 14 additional pieces that contribute an effective length of 24.5 cm each.

The total length in centimeters is:
25 cm + (14 * 24.5 cm)

Now, let's calculate that:
25 cm + (14 * 24.5 cm) = 25 cm + 343 cm
Total length = 368 cm

To convert centimeters to meters, we divide by 100 (since 1 meter = 100 centimeters).

Total length in meters = 368 cm / 100
Total length in meters = 3.68 m

So, the length of the paper in meters is 3.68 m.
Question: There are boxes A, B, C, and D with different weights. Box B is heavier than Box C, and Box A is lighter than Box C. If box D is heavier than B, which box is the heaviest?
Answer: Box D is the heaviest because it is heavier than Box B, which is heavier than Box C, and Box A is lighter than Box C. Therefore, the order from heaviest to lightest is D > B > C > A, making Box D the heaviest.
Question: Jiwon went to a snack bar with his friends. There are 4 friends, including Jiwon, and they want to buy 5 fish cakes at 200 won each and 7 servings of tteokbokki at 800 won each. How much does one person have to pay if all of his friends pay the same?
Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the fish cakes and tteokbokki.

The cost of 5 fish cakes at 200 won each is:
5 fish cakes * 200 won/fish cake = 1000 won

The cost of 7 servings of tteokbokki at 800 won each is:
7 servings * 800 won/serving = 5600 won

Now, let's add the cost of the fish cakes and tteokbokki to get the total cost:
Total cost = Cost of fish cakes + Cost of tteokbokki
Total cost = 1000 won + 5600 won
Total cost = 6600 won

Since there are 4 friends, including Jiwon, we need to divide the total cost by 4 to find out how much each person has to pay:
Total cost per person = Total cost / Number of friends
Total cost per person = 6600 won / 4
Total cost per person = 1650 won

So, each person has to pay 1650 won.

Question: There are three bottles, A, B, and C, each with different sizes. 7 bottles of A and 3 bottles of B have the same capacity, and 1 bottle of B and 5 bottles of C are the same. How many bottles of C are equal to 21 bottles of A?
Answer: Let's denote the capacity of bottle A as \( a \), bottle B as \( b \), and bottle C as \( c \).

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. \( 7a = 3b \) (7 bottles of A have the same capacity as 3 bottles of B)
2. \( b = 5c \) (1 bottle of B has the same capacity as 5 bottles of C)

We want to find out how many bottles of C are equal to 21 bottles of A.

First, let's express \( b \) in terms of \( a \) using the first equation:

\[ 7a = 3b \]
\[ b = \frac{7a}{3} \]

Now, let's substitute \( b \) in the second equation with \( \frac{7a}{3} \):

\[ b = 5c \]
\[ \frac{7a}{3} = 5c \]

Now, we want to find the equivalent number of bottles of C for 21 bottles of A. Let's express 21 bottles of A in terms of \( c \):

\[ 21a = x \cdot c \]

We need to find \( x \), the number of bottles of C that are equivalent to 21 bottles of A. To do this, we can use the relationship we found between \( a \) and \( c \):

\[ \frac{7a}{3} = 5c \]
\[ a = \frac{15c}{7} \]

Now, substitute \( a \) in the equation for 21 bottles of A:

\[ 21 \cdot \frac{15c}{7} = x \cdot c \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 3 \cdot 15c = x \cdot c \]
\[ 45c = x \cdot c \]

Now, divide both sides by \( c \) to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 45 \]

Therefore, 21 bottles of A are equal to 45 bottles of C.
Question: There are 3 apples and 2 persimmons in the box. How many persimmons are in the box?
Answer: There are 2 persimmons in the box.
Question: You have a rectangular garden. The garden is 500 centimeters (cm) wide and 800 centimeters (cm) long. What is the area of this garden in square meters (m2)?
Answer: To find the area of the garden in square meters, we first need to calculate the area in square centimeters and then convert it to square meters.

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:
Area = Length × Width

Given that the length is 800 cm and the width is 500 cm, the area in square centimeters is:
Area = 800 cm × 500 cm
Area = 400,000 cm²

Now, to convert square centimeters to square meters, we need to know that 1 square meter is equal to 10,000 square centimeters (since 1 meter is 100 centimeters, and area is two-dimensional, we square the conversion factor: 100 cm × 100 cm = 10,000 cm²).

So, to convert the area from cm² to m², we divide by 10,000:
Area in m² = Area in cm² / 10,000
Area in m² = 400,000 cm² / 10,000
Area in m² = 40 m²

Therefore, the area of the garden is 40 square meters (m²).

Question: The conch-shaped bread is 250 grams (g) and I made two boxes with 12 each. The Red-bean bread is 200 grams (g) and is made into three boxes with 16 each. Which bread is in the box that weighs more than other boxes?
Answer: First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of bread per box.

For the conch-shaped bread:
Each bread weighs 250 grams and there are 12 in a box, so:
250 grams/bread * 12 breads/box = 3000 grams/box

For the Red-bean bread:
Each bread weighs 200 grams and there are 16 in a box, so:
200 grams/bread * 16 breads/box = 3200 grams/box

Comparing the two:
- A box of conch-shaped bread weighs 3000 grams.
- A box of Red-bean bread weighs 3200 grams.

The box with the Red-bean bread weighs more than the box with the conch-shaped bread.
Question: Tigers are said to run 3.8 kilometers (km) per hour. How many kilometers (km) could the tiger run without stopping in 2 hours and 45 minutes?
Answer: To calculate the distance a tiger could run without stopping in 2 hours and 45 minutes, we first need to convert the time into hours since the speed is given in kilometers per hour (km/h).

2 hours and 45 minutes is equivalent to 2 hours + (45 minutes / 60 minutes per hour) = 2 + 0.75 hours = 2.75 hours.

Now, we can use the speed of the tiger to calculate the distance:

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 3.8 km/h × 2.75 hours

Distance = 10.45 km

So, the tiger could run 10.45 kilometers without stopping in 2 hours and 45 minutes.
Question: There is a box with a width of 24 centimeters (cm), a length of 15 centimeters (cm), and a height of 28 centimeters (cm). If you fill this box with as many milk cartons as possible, with a width of 4 centimeters (cm), a length of 5 centimeters (cm), and a height of 7 centimeters (cm), how many milk cartons will it fit?
Answer: To determine how many milk cartons can fit in the box, we need to calculate the volume of both the box and a single milk carton and then divide the volume of the box by the volume of a milk carton.

The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (like the box and the milk carton) can be calculated using the formula:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

First, let's calculate the volume of the box:
\[ V_{\text{box}} = 24 \text{ cm (width)} \times 15 \text{ cm (length)} \times 28 \text{ cm (height)} \]
\[ V_{\text{box}} = 24 \times 15 \times 28 \]
\[ V_{\text{box}} = 360 \times 28 \]
\[ V_{\text{box}} = 10080 \text{ cm}^3 \]

Now, let's calculate the volume of a single milk carton:
\[ V_{\text{milk carton}} = 4 \text{ cm (width)} \times 5 \text{ cm (length)} \times 7 \text{ cm (height)} \]
\[ V_{\text{milk carton}} = 4 \times 5 \times 7 \]
\[ V_{\text{milk carton}} = 20 \times 7 \]
\[ V_{\text{milk carton}} = 140 \text{ cm}^3 \]

To find out how many milk cartons can fit in the box, we divide the volume of the box by the volume of a single milk carton:
\[ \text{Number of milk cartons} = \frac{V_{\text{box}}}{V_{\text{milk carton}}} \]
\[ \text{Number of milk cartons} = \frac{10080}{140} \]
\[ \text{Number of milk cartons} = 72 \]

Therefore, 72 milk cartons can fit in the box.

Answer: If you started with 16 pencils and ended up with 8, then you lost:

16 - 8 = 8 pencils.
Question: There is a cube with a side perimeter of 52 centimeters (cm). What is the surface area of this cube in square centimeters (cm2)?
Answer: The side perimeter of a cube refers to the perimeter of one of its faces, which is a square. Since a square has four equal sides, we can find the length of one side of the cube by dividing the side perimeter by 4.

Side perimeter of the cube = 52 cm
Length of one side of the cube (s) = Side perimeter / 4
s = 52 cm / 4
s = 13 cm

The surface area (SA) of a cube is calculated by multiplying the area of one face by 6 (since a cube has 6 faces).

Area of one face = s^2
Area of one face = (13 cm)^2
Area of one face = 169 cm^2

Surface area of the cube = 6 * Area of one face
SA = 6 * 169 cm^2
SA = 1014 cm^2

Therefore, the surface area of the cube is 1014 square centimeters (cm^2).

Question: There are 56 tulips. Red tulips are 3/7 of the total. Blue tulips are 3/8 of the total. If the rest are pink tulips, how many pink tulips are there?
Answer: First, let's find out how many red tulips there are. Since red tulips are 3/7 of the total, we can calculate the number of red tulips by multiplying the total number of tulips by 3/7:

Number of red tulips = (3/7) * 56

Now, let's find out how many blue tulips there are. Since blue tulips are 3/8 of the total, we can calculate the number of blue tulips by multiplying the total number of tulips by 3/8:

Number of blue tulips = (3/8) * 56

Finally, to find out how many pink tulips there are, we subtract the number of red and blue tulips from the total number of tulips:

Number of pink tulips = Total tulips - (Number of red tulips + Number of blue tulips)

Let's do the calculations:

Number of red tulips = (3/7) * 56 = 3 * 8 = 24
Number of blue tulips = (3/8) * 56 = 3 * 7 = 21

Number of pink tulips = 56 - (24 + 21) = 56 - 45 = 11

So, there are 11 pink tulips.
Question: The TV license fee is 30 won per 10 seconds. If Mingyu watched TV for 2 minutes and 40 seconds, how much would the license fee be?
Answer: First, we need to convert the time Mingyu watched TV into seconds. 

2 minutes and 40 seconds is equal to (2 * 60) + 40 seconds, which is 120 + 40 seconds, totaling 160 seconds.

Now, we know the TV license fee is 30 won per 10 seconds. To find out how many 10-second intervals are in 160 seconds, we divide 160 by 10, which gives us 16 intervals.

Finally, we multiply the number of intervals by the fee per interval to find the total cost:

16 intervals * 30 won per interval = 480 won

So, the license fee for watching TV for 2 minutes and 40 seconds would be 480 won.
Question: A small square is made by dividing a square with a side of 20 centimeters (cm) into thirds. Find the area of the newly created small square in square centimeters (cm2), rounded to two decimal places.
Answer: To find the area of the newly created small square, we first need to determine the side length of the small square.

Since the original square with a side of 20 cm is divided into thirds, each third will have a side length of \( \frac{20}{3} \) cm.

The area of a square is found by squaring the side length. So, the area of the small square is:

\( \left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 \) cm²

\( = \frac{400}{9} \) cm²

\( = 44.44 \) cm² (rounded to two decimal places)

So, the area of the newly created small square is 44.44 cm².

Question: Find the sum of odd numbers from 100 to 200.
Answer: To find the sum of odd numbers from 100 to 200, we first need to identify the first and last odd numbers in this range.

The first odd number after 100 is 101, and the last odd number before 200 is 199.

Now, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

Sum = n/2 * (first term + last term)

where n is the number of terms.

To find n, we can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:

last term = first term + (n - 1) * common difference

Here, the common difference is 2 (since we are looking at odd numbers, which are 2 units apart).

199 = 101 + (n - 1) * 2

Solving for n:

199 = 101 + 2n - 2
199 = 99 + 2n
100 = 2n
n = 50

So, there are 50 odd numbers between 100 and 200.

Now, we can find the sum:

Sum = 50/2 * (101 + 199)
Sum = 25 * (300)
Sum = 7500

Therefore, the sum of odd numbers from 100 to 200 is 7500.
Question: Find the number of numbers less than 0.4 among 0.8, 1/2, 0.3, and 1/3.
Answer: To find the number of numbers less than 0.4 among the given numbers, we need to compare each number to 0.4.

The given numbers are:
0.8, 1/2, 0.3, and 1/3.

Let's compare each number to 0.4:

1. 0.8 is greater than 0.4.
2. 1/2 is equal to 0.5 when converted to a decimal, which is also greater than 0.4.
3. 0.3 is less than 0.4.
4. 1/3 is equal to approximately 0.333 when converted to a decimal, which is less than 0.4.

So, among the given numbers, 0.3 and 1/3 are less than 0.4.

Therefore, the number of numbers less than 0.4 among the given numbers is 2.
Question: Out of 5 students, 3 are boys and 2 are girls. When 5 people are lined up in a row, find the case where all the female students stand in a row.
Answer: To find the case where both female students stand in a row, we can consider the two girls as a single unit since they must be together. Then, we have 4 units to arrange: 3 boys (B1, B2, B3) and 1 pair of girls (G).

The number of ways to arrange these 4 units in a row is 4! (4 factorial), which is:

4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24

However, within the girls' unit, the two girls can switch places. There are 2! ways to arrange the two girls within their unit, which is:

2! = 2 × 1 = 2

Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange the 5 students such that the two girls are always together is:

4! × 2! = 24 × 2 = 48

So, there are 48 different cases where the two female students stand in a row.

Question: 55 students participated in A competition and B competition. Among them, 38 students participated in A  competition, and 42 students participated in B competition. If no student did not participate in neither competitions A nor B, how many students participated in both competitions?
Answer: Let's denote the number of students who participated in both competitions as X.

According to the problem, we have the following information:

- The total number of students who participated in at least one of the competitions is 55.
- The number of students who participated in competition A is 38.
- The number of students who participated in competition B is 42.

We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of students who participated in both competitions. The principle of inclusion-exclusion states that for any two sets, the size of their union is equal to the sum of the sizes of each set minus the size of their intersection.

In this case, the union of the two sets (students who participated in competition A and students who participated in competition B) is the total number of students who participated in at least one competition, which is 55.

So, we have:

Number of students in A + Number of students in B - Number of students in both A and B = Total number of students

38 (A) + 42 (B) - X (Both A and B) = 55

80 - X = 55

X = 80 - 55

X = 25

Therefore, 25 students participated in both competitions A and B.
Question: If the son's age is 1 year less than 1/4 of the father's age and the father's age is 5 years less than 5 times the son's age, how old is the son?
Answer: Let's denote the son's age as S and the father's age as F.

According to the first statement, the son's age is 1 year less than 1/4 of the father's age. This can be written as:
S = (1/4)F - 1 ...(1)

According to the second statement, the father's age is 5 years less than 5 times the son's age. This can be written as:
F = 5S - 5 ...(2)

Now, we can substitute the expression for F from equation (2) into equation (1) to solve for S:
S = (1/4)(5S - 5) - 1

Multiplying both sides by 4 to get rid of the fraction:
4S = 5S - 5 - 4

Now, let's move all terms involving S to one side and constants to the other side:
4S - 5S = -5 - 4

Combine like terms:
-S = -9

Now, divide both sides by -1 to solve for S:
S = 9

So, the son is 9 years old.
Question: While a centipede can crawl 5 meters (m) in 3 minutes, an earthworm can crawl 5 meters (m) in 2 minutes. If the centipede starts crawling 20 meters (m) ahead of the earthworm and they both start crawling at the same time, find how many minutes takes for them to meet after the departure.
Answer: First, let's find the speed of the centipede and the earthworm.

The centipede crawls 5 meters in 3 minutes, so its speed is:
Speed of centipede = Distance / Time
Speed of centipede = 5 m / 3 min

The earthworm crawls 5 meters in 2 minutes, so its speed is:
Speed of earthworm = Distance / Time
Speed of earthworm = 5 m / 2 min

Now, let's find the relative speed at which the earthworm is gaining on the centipede. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract the speed of the centipede from the speed of the earthworm to find the relative speed.

Relative speed = Speed of earthworm - Speed of centipede
Relative speed = (5/2) m/min - (5/3) m/min

To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 6 in this case.

Relative speed = (15/6) m/min - (10/6) m/min
Relative speed = (15 - 10) / 6 m/min
Relative speed = 5 / 6 m/min

Now, we know the centipede starts 20 meters ahead. We need to find out how long it takes for the earthworm to cover this 20-meter gap at the relative speed.

Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 20 m / (5/6) m/min

To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal.

Time = 20 m * (6/5) min/m
Time = (20 * 6) / 5 minutes
Time = 120 / 5 minutes
Time = 24 minutes

So, it takes 24 minutes for the earthworm to catch up to the centipede after they start crawling.

Question: Find the area in centimeters (cm) of a rectangle whose length is 4 centimeters (cm) and width is 2 centimeters (cm).
Answer: The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length by the width. 

So, for a rectangle with a length of 4 cm and a width of 2 cm, the area would be:

Area = length × width
Area = 4 cm × 2 cm
Area = 8 cm²

Therefore, the area of the rectangle is 8 square centimeters (cm²).
Question: On the day of the soccer match, 12 bottles of water and 34 bottles of soda were given to the players. After the soccer game, I counted all the remaining water and drinks and it was 30 bottles. The number of bottles of drink consumed by the players is three times the number of bottles of water consumed by the players. How many bottles of water did the players drink?
Answer: Let's denote the number of bottles of water consumed by the players as W and the number of bottles of soda consumed as D.

According to the information given, the total number of bottles consumed (water and soda) is three times the number of bottles of water consumed. So we can write the following equation:

D = 3W

We also know that there were initially 12 bottles of water and 34 bottles of soda, and after the game, there were 30 bottles left in total. This means that the number of bottles consumed is:

(12 + 34) - 30 = 46 - 30 = 16 bottles

Now, we have to distribute these 16 bottles between water and soda in such a way that the number of soda bottles consumed is three times the number of water bottles consumed.

Since D = 3W and the total consumed is 16, we can write:

W + D = 16
W + 3W = 16
4W = 16
W = 16 / 4
W = 4

So, the players drank 4 bottles of water.
Question: Hanbyul and Seulgi ran. During the same time, Hanbyul ran 1/100 of 10.2 kilometers (km), and Seulgi ran 100 meters (m). Who ran more?
Answer: First, let's convert Hanbyul's distance into meters since Seulgi's distance is already given in meters. 

1 kilometer is equal to 1000 meters. 

Hanbyul ran 1/100 of 10.2 kilometers, so we calculate:
10.2 km * (1/100) = 0.102 km

Now, convert 0.102 km to meters:
0.102 km * 1000 m/km = 102 m

Now we can compare the distances:
Hanbyul ran 102 meters.
Seulgi ran 100 meters.

Hanbyul ran more, as 102 meters is greater than 100 meters.

Question: There are 15 red apples, 8 green apples, and 32 pears. How many more pears are there than apples?
Answer: To find out how many more pears there are than apples, we first need to find the total number of apples. 

There are 15 red apples and 8 green apples, so the total number of apples is:

15 red apples + 8 green apples = 23 apples

Now, we compare this to the number of pears:

32 pears - 23 apples = 9 more pears than apples

So, there are 9 more pears than apples.
Question: On the first day, 318 liters (L) of water were added to the pool, and on the second day, 312 liters (L) of water were added. On the third day, 180 liters (L) of water were added in the morning and 162 liters (L) in the afternoon. How many liters (L) of water were added to the pool on average each day?
Answer: To find the average amount of water added to the pool each day, we first need to calculate the total amount of water added over the three days and then divide that total by the number of days.

On the first day, 318 liters were added.
On the second day, 312 liters were added.
On the third day, a total of 180 liters + 162 liters = 342 liters were added.

Now, let's add up the total amount of water added over the three days:
318 liters + 312 liters + 342 liters = 972 liters

Next, we divide the total amount of water by the number of days to find the average:
972 liters / 3 days = 324 liters per day

So, on average, 324 liters of water were added to the pool each day.

Question: The faucet is filling the water tank at the speed of 36.6 liters (l) per minute, but there is a hole in the bottom of the tank, so that water leaks out of the tank at the speed of 2.4 liters (l) per minute. If the water tank contained 10 liters (l) of water initially, how many liters (l) of water is in the water tank after 7 minutes 45 seconds?
Answer: First, let's convert the time from minutes and seconds to just minutes to make the calculation easier. We have 7 minutes and 45 seconds, which is 7 minutes plus 45 seconds. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, 45 seconds is equal to 45/60 minutes.

45/60 = 0.75 minutes

So, the total time in minutes is 7 + 0.75 = 7.75 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the net rate at which the water is filling the tank. The faucet fills the tank at 36.6 liters per minute, and the hole leaks water at 2.4 liters per minute. So the net rate of water filling the tank is:

36.6 liters/minute (filling) - 2.4 liters/minute (leaking) = 34.2 liters/minute (net filling rate)

Now we can calculate the amount of water that is added to the tank in 7.75 minutes at the net filling rate:

34.2 liters/minute * 7.75 minutes = 265.05 liters

However, we must remember that the tank already contained 10 liters of water initially. So, the total amount of water in the tank after 7.75 minutes is:

Initial water + Added water = 10 liters + 265.05 liters = 275.05 liters

Therefore, after 7 minutes and 45 seconds, there are 275.05 liters of water in the water tank.
Question: My mother bought 10 liters (L) of strawberry juice and 5 liters (L) of grape juice. Which of the two did she buy more of?

Question: A theater ticket is rectangular in shape, measuring 28 centimeters (cm) in perimeter and 6 centimeters (cm) in width. Find the area of this theater ticket.
Answer: To find the area of the rectangular theater ticket, we need to know both its width and length. We already know the width is 6 cm. We can use the perimeter to find the length.

The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:
P = 2 * (length + width)

We know the perimeter is 28 cm, so we can set up the equation:
28 = 2 * (length + 6)

Now, we can solve for the length:
28 = 2 * length + 12
28 - 12 = 2 * length
16 = 2 * length
length = 16 / 2
length = 8 cm

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can find the area (A) of the rectangle using the formula:
A = length * width

Substitute the known values:
A = 8 cm * 6 cm
A = 48 cm²

The area of the theater ticket is 48 square centimeters.
Question: Of the 80 students, 45 already have colored paper and the rest do not. If you want to distribute 1645 pieces of colored paper equally to students who do not have colored paper, how many pieces do you need to distribute to each student?
Answer: First, we need to find out how many students do not have colored paper. 

Total number of students = 80
Number of students who already have colored paper = 45

Number of students who do not have colored paper = Total number of students - Number of students who already have colored paper
Number of students who do not have colored paper = 80 - 45
Number of students who do not have colored paper = 35

Now, we have 1645 pieces of colored paper to distribute equally among the 35 students who do not have colored paper.

Number of pieces per student = Total pieces of colored paper / Number of students without colored paper
Number of pieces per student = 1645 / 35
Number of pieces per student = 47

So, you need to distribute 47 pieces of colored paper to each of the 35 students who do not have colored paper.
Question: Hancho used 1/5 of the colored tape he had to make a work of art and gave 3/4 of the remaining to Gayeong. If the remaining length of the colored tape was 1 meter (m) and 50 centimeters (cm), how many meters (m) was the length of the colored tape that Hancho had at the beginning?
Answer: Let's denote the original length of the colored tape that Hancho had as \( x \) meters.

Hancho used \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the tape, so he had \( \frac{4}{5} \) of the tape left.

Then, he gave \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the remaining tape to Gayeong, which means he was left with \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the \( \frac{4}{5} \) of the original tape.

The remaining tape, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the \( \frac{4}{5} \) of the original tape, is given as 1 meter and 50 centimeters, which is 1.5 meters.

So, we have:

\( \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{4}{5} \times x = 1.5 \)

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\( \frac{1}{5} \times x = 1.5 \)

Now, to find \( x \), we multiply both sides by 5:

\( x = 1.5 \times 5 \)

\( x = 7.5 \)

Therefore, the original length of the colored tape that Hancho had was 7.5 meters.
Question: The exchange rate refers to the rate at which one country's currency is exchanged for another country's currency. Soojeong came back from a trip to the U.S. and exchanged the remaining 140 dollars for 158,760 won in Korean money at the bank today. What is the exchange rate of the Korean Won to the US Dollar today?

Answer: 158,760 won is the amount of Korean money Soojeong received for 140 US dollars. To find the exchange rate, we need to divide the amount of Korean money by the number of US dollars:

Exchange rate = Amount of Korean money / Number of US dollars

Question: Find the sum of odd numbers from 100 to 200.
Answer: To find the sum of odd numbers from 100 to 200, we first need to identify the first and last odd numbers in this range.

The first odd number after 100 is 101, and the last odd number before 200 is 199.

Now, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

Sum = n/2 * (first term + last term)

where n is the number of terms.

To find n, we can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:

last term = first term + (n - 1) * common difference

Here, the common difference is 2 (since we are looking at odd numbers, which are 2 units apart).

199 = 101 + (n - 1) * 2

Solving for n:

199 = 101 + 2n - 2
199 = 99 + 2n
100 = 2n
n = 50

So, there are 50 odd numbers between 100 and 200.

Now, we can find the sum:

Sum = 50/2 * (101 + 199)
Sum = 25 * (300)
Sum = 7500

Therefore, the sum of odd numbers from 100 to 200 is 7500.
Question: There is a cargo of 127000 kilograms (kg). How many more trucks are needed to transport this cargo from Busan to Seoul by 5000 kilograms (kg) trucks than by 8000 kilograms (kg) trucks?
Answer: First, let's calculate how many trucks would be needed for each type of truck:

For 5000 kg trucks:
127000 kg / 5000 kg/truck = 25.4 trucks
Since we can't have a fraction of a truck, we would need to round up to the next whole number, so we would need 26 trucks of 5000 kg capacity.

For 8000 kg trucks:
127000 kg / 8000 kg/truck = 15.875 trucks
Again, we can't have a fraction of a truck, so we would need to round up to the next whole number, which is 16 trucks of 8000 kg capacity.

Now, let's find out how many more trucks are needed with the 5000 kg capacity compared to the 8000 kg capacity:
26 trucks (5000 kg) - 16 trucks (8000 kg) = 10 trucks

Therefore, 10 more trucks are needed to transport the cargo by 5000 kg trucks than by 8000 kg trucks.

Question: Yoongi bought a 250 won candy at the mart and received 500 won as pocket money. After that, he spent half of my money on a pencil, and he had 420 won left. How much money did Yoongi have at first?
Answer: Let's break down the transactions step by step to find out how much money Yoongi had at first.

1. Yoongi bought a candy for 250 won.
2. He received 500 won as pocket money.
3. He spent half of his money on a pencil.
4. He had 420 won left.

First, we need to find out how much money Yoongi spent on the pencil. Since he had 420 won left after buying the pencil, and this amount represents the other half of his money (because he spent half on the pencil), we can double the 420 won to find out the total amount he had before buying the pencil.

420 won (amount left) * 2 = 840 won (total amount before buying the pencil)

Now, we know that the 840 won includes the 500 won pocket money he received. So, before receiving the pocket money, Yoongi had:

840 won (total before buying the pencil) - 500 won (pocket money) = 340 won

Finally, we need to add back the cost of the candy to find out how much money Yoongi had at first, because he spent 250 won on the candy before receiving the pocket money.

340 won (before pocket money) + 250 won (cost of candy) = 590 won

So, Yoongi had 590 won at first before he bought the candy and received his pocket money.
Question: Choose the second largest number among 5, 8, 4, 3, and 2.
Answer: The second largest number among 5, 8, 4, 3, and 2 is 5.
Question: When A is divided by 8, the quotient is B and the remainder is C. A, B, and C are natural numbers. In this, the quotient and remainder are equal. Find the largest number of A which is a divided number.
Answer: Given that the quotient B and the remainder C are equal when A is divided by 8, we can write the division as:

A = 8B + C

Since B = C, we can substitute C for B:

A = 8C + C
A = 9C

To find the largest number A which is divisible by 8, we need to find the largest possible value for C that is less than 8, because the remainder must be less than the divisor.

The largest possible value for C that is less than 8 is 7.

So, we substitute C with 7:

A = 9 * 7
A = 63

Therefore, the largest number A which is divisible by 8 and satisfies the given conditions is 63.

Question: When you add 99 to a certain number and multiply that by 17, it becomes 3111. Find that number in question.
Answer: Let's call the certain number "x". According to the problem, when you add 99 to x and then multiply the result by 17, you get 3111. We can write this as an equation:

17 * (x + 99) = 3111

Now, let's solve for x:

First, divide both sides of the equation by 17 to isolate the term with x:

(x + 99) = 3111 / 17
(x + 99) = 183

Now, subtract 99 from both sides to solve for x:

x = 183 - 99
x = 84

So, the number in question is 84.
Question: A cuboid is 12 centimeters (cm) wide, 16 centimeters (cm) long, and 14 centimeters (cm) high. What is the surface area of the largest cube that can be cut out of this cube?
Answer: To find the largest cube that can be cut out of the cuboid, we need to look at the smallest dimension of the cuboid, because the cube's sides must be equal in length and cannot exceed the smallest dimension of the cuboid.

The dimensions of the cuboid are:
- Width: 12 cm
- Length: 16 cm
- Height: 14 cm

The smallest dimension is the width, which is 12 cm. Therefore, the largest cube that can be cut out of the cuboid will have sides of 12 cm.

The surface area of a cube is calculated by the formula:
Surface Area = 6 * (side length)^2

For the largest cube that can be cut out:
Surface Area = 6 * (12 cm)^2
Surface Area = 6 * 144 cm^2
Surface Area = 864 cm^2

So, the surface area of the largest cube that can be cut out of the cuboid is 864 square centimeters.
Question: Junseop's hair is 9 centimeters (cm) 8 millimeters (mm) long, Taehun's hair is 8.9 centimeters (cm), and Hayul's hair is 9.3 centimeters (cm) long. Which of the three friends has the shortest hair?
Answer: To compare the lengths of the hair of Junseop, Taehun, and Hayul, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit. Since Taehun's and Hayul's hair lengths are already in centimeters, we only need to convert Junseop's hair length from centimeters and millimeters to centimeters.

Junseop's hair is 9 centimeters and 8 millimeters long. There are 10 millimeters in a centimeter, so 8 millimeters is equal to 0.8 centimeters. Therefore, Junseop's hair length in centimeters is:

9 cm + 0.8 cm = 9.8 cm

Now we can compare the lengths:

- Junseop's hair: 9.8 cm
- Taehun's hair: 8.9 cm
- Hayul's hair: 9.3 cm

Taehun has the shortest hair at 8.9 cm.

Question: There is a red tissue and a blue tissue. If the red tissue is 12 centimeters (cm) longer than the blue tissue, and twice the length of the red tissue equals three times the length of the blue tissue, find the length of the blue tissue.
Answer: Let's denote the length of the blue tissue as \( B \) cm and the length of the red tissue as \( R \) cm.

According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. The red tissue is 12 cm longer than the blue tissue:
\[ R = B + 12 \]

2. Twice the length of the red tissue equals three times the length of the blue tissue:
\[ 2R = 3B \]

Now we can use these two equations to solve for \( B \).

From the first equation, we can express \( R \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ R = B + 12 \]

Substitute this expression for \( R \) into the second equation:
\[ 2(B + 12) = 3B \]

Now, distribute the 2 on the left side of the equation:
\[ 2B + 24 = 3B \]

Next, we want to get all the terms with \( B \) on one side of the equation and the constants on the other side. We can do this by subtracting \( 2B \) from both sides:
\[ 24 = 3B - 2B \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 24 = B \]

So, the length of the blue tissue is 24 cm.
Question: A and B are single digit numbers. A375B is a five digit number and is a multiple of 24. What is the number of all numbers that can be A?
Answer: For a number to be a multiple of 24, it must be a multiple of both 3 and 8.

First, let's consider the divisibility rule for 8: A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number that is divisible by 8. Since we are looking at the number A375B, we need to consider the last three digits, which are 75B. We need to find the values of B such that 75B is divisible by 8.

Let's try the single-digit numbers for B (0-9) to see which ones make 75B divisible by 8:

- 750 ÷ 8 = 93.75 (not divisible)
- 751 ÷ 8 = 93.875 (not divisible)
- 752 ÷ 8 = 94 (divisible)
- 753 ÷ 8 = 94.125 (not divisible)
- 754 ÷ 8 = 94.25 (not divisible)
- 755 ÷ 8 = 94.375 (not divisible)
- 756 ÷ 8 = 94.5 (not divisible)
- 757 ÷ 8 = 94.625 (not divisible)
- 758 ÷ 8 = 94.75 (not divisible)
- 759 ÷ 8 = 94.875 (not divisible)

So, the only value for B that makes 75B divisible by 8 is 2.

Now, let's consider the divisibility rule for 3: A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Since we know B is 2, we need to find the values of A such that the sum of the digits in A3752 is divisible by 3.

The sum of the known digits is 3 + 7 + 5 + 2 = 17. We need to find the values of A such that A + 17 is divisible by 3.

Let's try the single-digit numbers for A (0-9) to see which ones make A + 17 divisible by 3:

- 0 + 17 = 17 (not divisible)
- 1 + 17 = 18 (divisible)
- 2 + 17 = 19 (not divisible)
- 3 + 17 = 20 (not divisible)
- 4 + 17 = 21 (divisible)
- 5 + 17 = 22 (not divisible)
- 6 + 17 = 23 (not divisible)
- 7 + 17 = 24 (divisible)
- 8 + 17 = 25 (not divisible)
- 9 + 17 = 26 (not divisible)

So, the possible values for A that make A3752 divisible by 3 are 1, 4, and 7.

Therefore, the number of all numbers that can be A is 3 (1, 4, and 7).
Question: The number 397 less than B is A, and A is 742. If B equals C plus 693, find the A minus C.
Answer: Given that A is 397 less than B, we can write the equation:

A = B - 397

We are told that A is 742, so we can substitute A with 742 in the equation:

742 = B - 397

Now, we can solve for B:

B = 742 + 397
B = 1139

We are also told that B equals C plus 693, so we can write the equation:

B = C + 693

We already found that B is 1139, so we can substitute B with 1139 in the equation:

1139 = C + 693

Now, we can solve for C:

C = 1139 - 693
C = 446

Now, to find A minus C, we subtract C from A:

A - C = 742 - 446
A - C = 296

Therefore, A minus C is 296.

Question: You made a mistake in multiplying 36 by a number, so I added a number to 63 instead. Suppose that you got 70. How much is it if you calculate it correctly?
Answer: If you added a number to 63 and got 70, then the number you added is:

70 - 63 = 7

Now, if you were supposed to multiply 36 by that number instead of adding it to 63, the correct calculation would be:

36 * 7 = 252

So, if you calculate it correctly, the result is 252.
Question: When 45 is divided by a number, the quotient is 11 and the remainder is 1. Find the value of the number.
Answer: Let's call the number we are trying to find "n". 

According to the division algorithm, when a number is divided by another number, the relationship between the dividend (the number being divided), the divisor (the number by which we are dividing), the quotient, and the remainder can be expressed as:

Dividend = (Divisor × Quotient) + Remainder

In this case, the dividend is 45, the quotient is 11, and the remainder is 1. We can set up the equation as follows:

45 = (n × 11) + 1

Now, we can solve for n:

45 - 1 = 11n
44 = 11n

Divide both sides by 11 to isolate n:

n = 44 / 11
n = 4

So the value of the number is 4.
Question: I need to divide a number by 5, but I mistakenly multiplied it by 7 and then added 2/9 to get 5 and 4/9. If you calculate correctly, show how much it is to 2 decimal places.

According to your statement, you mistakenly multiplied \( x \) by 7 and then added \( \frac{2}{9} \) to get \( 5 \frac{4}{9} \).

So the equation based on your mistake is:
\[ 7x + \frac{2}{9} = 5 \frac{4}{9} \]

First, let's convert \( 5 \frac{4}{9} \) to an improper fraction:
\[ 5 \frac{4}{9} = \frac{45}{9} + \frac{4}{9} = \frac{49}{9} \]

Now we have the equation:
\[ 7x + \frac{2}{9} = \frac{49}{9} \]

Subtract \( \frac{2}{9} \) from both sides to isolate \( 7x \):
\[ 7x = \frac{49}{9} - \frac{2}{9} \]
\[ 7x = \frac{47}{9} \]

Now, divide both sides by 7 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{47}{9} \div 7 \]
\[ x = \frac{47}{9} \times \frac{1}{7} \]
\[ x = \frac{47}{63} \]

To find the correct result of dividing the original number by 5, we divide \( x \) by 5:
\[ \frac{x}{5} = \frac{47}{63} \div 5 \]
\[ \frac{x}{5} = \frac{47}{63} \times \frac{1}{5} \]
\[ \frac{x}{5} = \frac{47}{315} \]

Now, let's convert \( \frac{47}{315} \) to a decimal to two decimal places:
\[ \frac{47}{315} \approx 0.149206 \]

Rounded to two decimal places, the correct result is:
\[ \frac{x}{5} \approx 0.15 \]

Question: I'm trying to put 9 toys in 1 box. How many boxes are needed to fit all 81 toys in the box?
Answer: If you can fit 9 toys in 1 box, then to find out how many boxes you need for 81 toys, you would divide the total number of toys by the number of toys that can fit in one box.

So, you would calculate 81 toys ÷ 9 toys per box = 9 boxes.

You would need 9 boxes to fit all 81 toys.
Question: If you have three numbers of 10, 11 and 12, what do you get for the difference between the largest number and the second largest number?
Answer: The largest number is 12 and the second largest number is 11. The difference between them is:

12 - 11 = 1

So, the difference between the largest number and the second largest number is 1.
Question: How many numbers from 8 to 21 are there?
Answer: To find the number of numbers from 8 to 21, you can simply subtract the smaller number from the larger number and then add 1 (because we are including both the starting and ending numbers).

So, the calculation would be:

21 - 8 = 13
13 + 1 = 14

There are 14 numbers from 8 to 21, including both 8 and 21.

Question: When 17 is divided by 2, the quotient is A and the remainder is B. Find what B is.
Answer: When 17 is divided by 2, the division can be expressed as:

17 = 2 * A + B

where A is the quotient and B is the remainder.

Since 17 is an odd number and 2 is an even number, when 17 is divided by 2, it will not divide evenly. The largest multiple of 2 that is less than 17 is 16 (which is 2 * 8). Therefore, the quotient A is 8.

To find the remainder B, we subtract the product of the quotient and the divisor (2 * A) from the original number (17):

B = 17 - (2 * A)
B = 17 - (2 * 8)
B = 17 - 16
B = 1

So the remainder B is 1.
Question: If the three-digit natural number 7AB is a multiple of 7, how many numbers are possible to become two-digit natural number AB?
Answer: To find out how many two-digit numbers AB are possible such that 7AB is a multiple of 7, we need to check each two-digit number AB from 10 to 99 and see if appending a 7 in front of it (to make it 7AB) results in a number that is divisible by 7.

Let's start by checking the smallest two-digit number, which is 10. If we append 7 in front of it, we get 710. Now we need to check if 710 is divisible by 7. We can do this by performing the division or by using divisibility rules for 7.

Let's use the divisibility rule for 7: Double the last digit and subtract it from the rest of the number. If the result is divisible by 7, then the original number is also divisible by 7.

For 710:
1. Double the last digit (0) to get 0.
2. Subtract it from the rest of the number (71 - 0 = 71).
3. Check if 71 is divisible by 7. It is not, so 710 is not divisible by 7.

We would need to repeat this process for each two-digit number AB from 10 to 99 and count how many times 7AB is divisible by 7.

However, there is a more efficient way to do this. Since we are looking for multiples of 7, we can start with the smallest three-digit multiple of 7 that starts with 7, which is 700, and then keep adding 7 until we reach the largest three-digit number starting with 7, which is 799.

Let's do this:

700 is divisible by 7 (it's 7 * 100).
The next multiple of 7 would be 700 + 7 = 707.
Continuing this process, we add 7 each time until we reach or exceed 799.

The numbers we get are: 700, 707, 714, 721,..., 799.

To find out how many numbers there are, we can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence:

Number of terms = (Last term - First term) / Common difference + 1

In this case:
Last term = 799 (the last three-digit number starting with 7 that is a multiple of 7)
First term = 700 (the first three-digit number starting with 7 that is a multiple of 7)
Common difference = 7 (since we are adding 7 each time)

Number of terms = (799 - 700) / 7 + 1
Number of terms = 99 / 7 + 1
Number of terms = 14 + 1
Number of terms = 15

So there are 15 possible two-digit numbers AB such that 7AB is a multiple of 7.
Question: Create a cube using string, and the volume of the cube at its largest is 3375 cubic centimeters (cm3). Find the length of the string.
Answer: To find the length of the string needed to create a cube, we first need to determine the length of one edge of the cube. Since the volume of the cube at its largest is 3375 cm³, we can find the length of one edge by taking the cube root of the volume.

The cube root of 3375 cm³ is:
\[ \sqrt[3]{3375} = 15 \text{ cm} \]

Now that we know one edge of the cube is 15 cm, we can find the total length of the edges of the cube. A cube has 12 edges, so we multiply the length of one edge by 12 to get the total length of the string.

Total length of the string = 12 edges × 15 cm/edge = 180 cm

Therefore, the length of the string needed to create the cube is 180 cm.

Question: What is the probability of getting a card with a number less than or equal to 9 when you draw one of the number cards 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, or 9?
Answer: To find the probability of drawing a card with a number less than or equal to 9 from the given set of number cards (1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9), we need to count the number of favorable outcomes and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes.

In this case, all the cards in the set (1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9) have numbers less than or equal to 9. Therefore, every card in the set is a favorable outcome.

The number of favorable outcomes (cards with a number less than or equal to 9) is 6 (since there are 6 cards in the set).

The total number of possible outcomes (total number of cards in the set) is also 6.

So, the probability (P) of drawing a card with a number less than or equal to 9 is:

P = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes
P = 6 / 6
P = 1

The probability of drawing a card with a number less than or equal to 9 from this set of cards is 1, which means it is certain to happen.
Question: Hyungjun has 324 grape-flavored candies and 541 strawberry-flavored candies, and Junghyeok has 416 orange-flavored candies and 253 cherry-flavored candies. Who has more candies, Hyungjun or Junghyeok?
Answer: To determine who has more candies, we need to add up the number of candies each person has.

Hyungjun has:
Grape-flavored candies: 324
Strawberry-flavored candies: 541
Total candies for Hyungjun = 324 + 541 = 865

Junghyeok has:
Orange-flavored candies: 416
Cherry-flavored candies: 253
Total candies for Junghyeok = 416 + 253 = 669

Comparing the totals:
Hyungjun has 865 candies.
Junghyeok has 669 candies.

Hyungjun has more candies than Junghyeok.
Question: Yoongi had 4 apples, Yuna had 5, and Jungkook had 6, but he ate 3 of them. Who has the fewest apples?

Question: 24 is the value of a number multiplied by 2/5. What number do you get when the number is multiplied by 1/15?
Answer: Let's call the original number "x". According to the information given, when x is multiplied by 2/5, the result is 24. We can write this as an equation:

(2/5)x = 24

To find the value of x, we need to solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 2/5:

x = 24 / (2/5)

To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal. The reciprocal of 2/5 is 5/2. So we have:

x = 24 * (5/2)

x = (24 * 5) / 2

x = 120 / 2

x = 60

Now that we have the value of x, we can find out what number we get when x is multiplied by 1/15:

(1/15)x = (1/15) * 60

To multiply, we simply multiply the numerators and denominators:

= (1 * 60) / (15 * 1)

= 60 / 15

= 4

So, when the original number (which is 60) is multiplied by 1/15, the result is 4.
Question: You had to divide a number by 6 but instead multiplied by 7 to get 126. What is the correctly calculated value?
Answer: To find the original number, we can divide 126 by 7 (since it was incorrectly multiplied by 7):

126 / 7 = 18

Now, to find the correctly calculated value (which should have been obtained by dividing the original number by 6), we divide the original number by 6:

18 / 6 = 3

So, the correctly calculated value is 3.
Question: If the coins are arranged in a square and there are 240 coins at the perimeter, what is the total number of coins?
Answer: Let's denote the side length of the square (in coins) as \( n \). Since the perimeter of the square consists of 4 sides, and we need to account for the corners being counted only once, the total number of coins on the perimeter is \( 4n - 4 \) (because each of the 4 corners is counted twice when we multiply the side length by 4).

Given that there are 240 coins at the perimeter, we can set up the equation:

\[ 4n - 4 = 240 \]

Now, let's solve for \( n \):

\[ 4n = 240 + 4 \]
\[ 4n = 244 \]
\[ n = \frac{244}{4} \]
\[ n = 61 \]

So, each side of the square has 61 coins. To find the total number of coins in the entire square, we square the side length:

\[ \text{Total number of coins} = n^2 \]
\[ \text{Total number of coins} = 61^2 \]
\[ \text{Total number of coins} = 3721 \]

Therefore, the total number of coins is 3721.

Question: Yongchan walked 1.05 kilometers (km) in 10 minutes. If Yongchan walked 460 meters (m) longer than Min-joo, how many kilometers (km) did Min-joo walk?
Answer: First, we need to convert the distance Yongchan walked from kilometers to meters to make it easier to compare with the distance Min-joo walked. 

1 kilometer is equal to 1000 meters. So, Yongchan walked:
1.05 km * 1000 m/km = 1050 meters

Now, we know that Yongchan walked 460 meters more than Min-joo. So, to find out how much Min-joo walked, we subtract 460 meters from Yongchan's distance:

1050 meters - 460 meters = 590 meters

Min-joo walked 590 meters. To convert this back to kilometers:

590 meters / 1000 m/km = 0.59 kilometers

Min-joo walked 0.59 kilometers.
Question: How many cases can you make a number that is 10 or more and 100 or less by selecting two cards from 1, 7, and 9?
Answer: To make a number that is 10 or more and 100 or less by selecting two cards from 1, 7, and 9, we can form two-digit numbers by placing one card in the tens place and the other in the ones place. We can't use the same card twice since we only have one of each card.

Here are the possible combinations:

1. 17 (1 in the tens place and 7 in the ones place)
2. 71 (7 in the tens place and 1 in the ones place)
3. 19 (1 in the tens place and 9 in the ones place)
4. 91 (9 in the tens place and 1 in the ones place)
5. 79 (7 in the tens place and 9 in the ones place)
6. 97 (9 in the tens place and 7 in the ones place)

All of these numbers are between 10 and 100. Therefore, there are 6 cases where you can make a number that is 10 or more and 100 or less by selecting two cards from 1, 7, and 9.
Question: The lengths of the two wires are 36 centimeters (cm) and 38 centimeters (cm), respectively. Make a square with the 36 centimeters (cm) wire and a rectangle 15 centimeters (cm) wide with the 38 centimeters (cm) wire. Find the difference between the area of the square and the rectangle.
Answer: First, let's find the side length of the square made from the 36 cm wire. Since a square has four equal sides, we divide the total length of the wire by 4 to find the length of one side:

Side length of square = Total length of wire / 4
Side length of square = 36 cm / 4
Side length of square = 9 cm

Now, let's calculate the area of the square:

Area of square = Side length × Side length
Area of square = 9 cm × 9 cm
Area of square = 81 cm²

Next, let's find the dimensions of the rectangle made from the 38 cm wire. We know the width of the rectangle is 15 cm, so we need to find the length. The perimeter of the rectangle is the total length of the wire, which is 38 cm. The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:

P = 2 × (length + width)

We can use this formula to find the length (L) of the rectangle:

38 cm = 2 × (L + 15 cm)
38 cm = 2L + 30 cm
38 cm - 30 cm = 2L
8 cm = 2L
L = 8 cm / 2
L = 4 cm

Now we have the length of the rectangle, which is 4 cm. Let's calculate the area of the rectangle:

Area of rectangle = Length × Width
Area of rectangle = 4 cm × 15 cm
Area of rectangle = 60 cm²

Finally, let's find the difference between the area of the square and the rectangle:

Difference in area = Area of square - Area of rectangle
Difference in area = 81 cm² - 60 cm²
Difference in area = 21 cm²

The difference between the area of the square and the rectangle is 21 cm².

Question: I have two different numbers, A and B. Find B from the two-digit addition equation 6A+B2=77.
Answer: To solve for B in the equation 6A + B2 = 77, we need to understand that A and B are single-digit numbers since they are part of a two-digit addition equation. The equation can be interpreted as a two-digit number (6A) plus a two-digit number (B2) equals 77.

Let's break down the two-digit numbers:

- The first two-digit number has a tens digit of 6 and a ones digit of A, so the number is 60 + A.
- The second two-digit number has a tens digit of B and a ones digit of 2, so the number is 10B + 2.

Now, let's rewrite the equation with this understanding:

(60 + A) + (10B + 2) = 77

Combine like terms:

60 + A + 10B + 2 = 77

Now, simplify the equation:

62 + A + 10B = 77

Subtract 62 from both sides to isolate A and 10B:

A + 10B = 77 - 62
A + 10B = 15

Since A and B are single-digit numbers, the only way for A + 10B to equal 15 is if A is 5 and B is 1. This is because 10B must be a multiple of 10 and the only single-digit value for B that would make 10B + A equal to 15 is when B is 1.

So, B = 1.

Question: Jinwoo and Seongmin can do 7/12 of the work if they do something for 8 days together. The two of them did this together for 8 days, and the rest was done by Jinwoo alone for 10 days. How many days will it take if Seongmin finishes this task by himself from the beginning?
Answer: Let's denote the total work by W.

According to the information given, Jinwoo and Seongmin together can do 7/12 of the work in 8 days. This means that in one day, they can do (7/12) / 8 of the work. Let's call this rate of work R1.

R1 = (7/12) / 8

Now, Jinwoo alone finishes the remaining work in 10 days. The remaining work is 5/12 of the total work (since 7/12 has been completed). Let's denote Jinwoo's rate of work as Rj.

Rj = (5/12) / 10

We want to find out how many days it will take Seongmin to finish the entire work by himself. Let's denote Seongmin's rate of work as Rs and the number of days it would take him to finish the work as Ds.

Since Jinwoo and Seongmin together have a combined rate of R1, we can express this as:

R1 = Rj + Rs

We already have R1 and Rj, so we can solve for Rs:

Rs = R1 - Rj

Now, we can find Ds by dividing the total work W by Rs:

Ds = W / Rs

Let's calculate R1 and Rj first:

R1 = (7/12) / 8 = 7/96 (work per day)

Rj = (5/12) / 10 = 1/24 (work per day)

Now, we can find Rs:

Rs = R1 - Rj
Rs = 7/96 - 1/24
Rs = 7/96 - 4/96
Rs = 3/96
Rs = 1/32 (work per day)

Finally, we can find Ds:

Ds = W / Rs
Ds = 1 / (1/32)
Ds = 32 days

So, it will take Seongmin 32 days to finish the task by himself.

Question: Minjae's class collected clothes they do not wear for donation. If the male student's clothes are 2.6 kilograms (kg) and the female student's clothes are 5.98 kilograms (kg), what is the total weight of the clothes collected?
Answer: To find the total weight of the clothes collected, you simply need to add the weight of the male student's clothes to the weight of the female student's clothes.

Male student's clothes: 2.6 kg
Female student's clothes: 5.98 kg

Total weight = Male student's clothes + Female student's clothes
Total weight = 2.6 kg + 5.98 kg
Total weight = 8.58 kg

The total weight of the clothes collected is 8.58 kilograms.
Question: Subtracting 10 from a number yields 15. How much do you get if you add 5 to this number?
Answer: Let's call the original number "x". According to the first statement, subtracting 10 from x gives us 15:

x - 10 = 15

To find the value of x, we add 10 to both sides of the equation:

x - 10 + 10 = 15 + 10
x = 25

Now, if we add 5 to this number (x), we get:

25 + 5 = 30

So, if you add 5 to the original number, you get 30.
Question: A rice container contains 12 kilograms (kg) and 400 grams (g) of rice, and B rice container contains 7600 grams (g) of rice. How many kilograms (kg) must be moved from A to B to equalize the amount of rice in the two rice containers?
Answer: First, let's convert the amount of rice in container A from kilograms and grams to grams, so we can compare it directly with the amount in container B.

1 kilogram = 1000 grams

So, 12 kilograms = 12 * 1000 grams = 12000 grams

Container A has 12 kg and 400 g, which is:
12000 g + 400 g = 12400 g

Container B has 7600 g.

Now, let's find the total amount of rice in both containers and then divide by 2 to find the amount that each container should have to be equal.

Total amount of rice = 12400 g (from A) + 7600 g (from B)
Total amount of rice = 20000 g

To equalize, each container should have:
20000 g / 2 = 10000 g

Container A currently has 12400 g, so we need to move rice from A to B until A has 10000 g.

Amount to move from A to B = 12400 g - 10000 g
Amount to move from A to B = 2400 g

So, we must move 2400 grams from container A to container B to equalize the amount of rice in the two containers. If you want to convert this amount back to kilograms:

2400 g = 2400 / 1000 kg
2400 g = 2.4 kg

Therefore, we must move 2.4 kilograms from container A to container B.

Question: Which of 0.8, 1/2, and 0.9 is the largest number less than 0.7?
Answer: None of the numbers 0.8, 1/2 (which is 0.5), and 0.9 are less than 0.7. However, if you are looking for the largest number among these that is less than 0.7, then it would be 1/2, which is equal to 0.5.
Question: When a particular number is multiplied by 15, the result is 45. What will you get when you subtract 1 from that particular number?
Answer: Let's call the particular number "x". According to the information given:

x * 15 = 45

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 15:

x = 45 / 15
x = 3

Now, if we subtract 1 from that particular number (x), we get:

3 - 1 = 2

So, when you subtract 1 from that particular number, you will get 2.
Question: How many kilograms (kg) are in 11 bricks if 5 bricks weigh 15.3 kilograms (kg)?
Answer: To find out how many kilograms are in 11 bricks, we first need to determine the weight of one brick. We can do this by dividing the total weight of the 5 bricks by the number of bricks:

15.3 kg / 5 bricks = 3.06 kg per brick

Now that we know the weight of one brick, we can calculate the weight of 11 bricks:

3.06 kg/brick * 11 bricks = 33.66 kg

Therefore, 11 bricks weigh 33.66 kilograms.

Question: They are going to give each person 2/5 of a pizza. How many pizzas are needed to serve 10 people?
Answer: To find out how many pizzas are needed to serve 10 people, where each person gets 2/5 of a pizza, you can set up the following calculation:

Number of pizzas needed = (Number of people) x (Fraction of pizza per person)

Number of pizzas needed = 10 x (2/5)

To calculate this, you can multiply the number of people by the numerator of the fraction and then divide by the denominator:

Number of pizzas needed = (10 x 2) / 5
Number of pizzas needed = 20 / 5
Number of pizzas needed = 4

So, you would need 4 whole pizzas to serve 10 people, with each person getting 2/5 of a pizza.
Question: What is the perimeter in centimeters (cm) of an octagon with all sides equal to 12 centimeters (cm)?
Answer: The perimeter of any polygon is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. Since an octagon has eight sides, and all sides of this octagon are equal to 12 centimeters, the perimeter P can be calculated as:

P = 8 * side length
P = 8 * 12 cm
P = 96 cm

So, the perimeter of the octagon is 96 centimeters.

Answer: Yuna planted fewer cabbages than Yoojung, and since Minyoung planted more than Yoojung, and Jimin planted more than Minyoung, it means Yuna planted the fewest cabbages.
Question: Find the number of two-digit integers that can be made by drawing 2 cards from 5 cards each containing the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
Answer: To form a two-digit integer, we need to select two cards from the set {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}. However, since we are forming a two-digit number, the first digit cannot be 0 (as that would make it a single-digit number).

So, for the first digit, we have 4 choices (1, 2, 3, or 4). For the second digit, we can use any of the 5 cards, including 0, because the second digit can be 0.

However, since we are drawing cards and not replacing them, we have one less choice for the second digit after choosing the first. So, after choosing the first digit, we have 4 remaining choices for the second digit.

Therefore, the number of two-digit integers we can form is the product of the number of choices for the first and second digits:

4 (choices for the first digit) * 4 (choices for the second digit) = 16 two-digit integers.
Question: If a watermelon sold at a store costs 200 won more than 5,000 won, find the price of the watermelon in units of 1,000 won.
Answer: If the watermelon costs 200 won more than 5,000 won, then the price of the watermelon is:

5,000 won + 200 won = 5,200 won

To find the price in units of 1,000 won, divide the total price by 1,000:

5,200 won / 1,000 = 5.2

So, the price of the watermelon is 5.2 units of 1,000 won.

Question: Jungkook saved as much as 3 divided by 6, and Yoongi saved as much as 4. Whose number is greater?
Answer: Jungkook saved 3 divided by 6, which equals 0.5. Yoongi saved 4. 

Comparing the two numbers, 4 is greater than 0.5. 

Therefore, Yoongi's number is greater.
Question: Find the number of even numbers in a three-digit number that can be formed by using 5, 6, and 7 only once.
Answer: To form a three-digit number using the digits 5, 6, and 7, each digit must be used exactly once. An even number ends with an even digit, so for a number to be even, it must end with the digit 6, as it is the only even digit among the three.

Now, let's count the number of even three-digit numbers that can be formed:

1. The hundreds place can be filled with either 5 or 7 (2 options).
2. The tens place can be filled with the remaining digit that was not used in the hundreds place (1 option).
3. The units place must be filled with the digit 6 to ensure the number is even (1 option).

So, the total number of even three-digit numbers that can be formed is:

2 (options for hundreds place) × 1 (option for tens place) × 1 (option for units place) = 2 × 1 × 1 = 2

Therefore, there are 2 even three-digit numbers that can be formed using the digits 5, 6, and 7 only once.
Question: There are three numbers 0.8, 1/2, and 0.9. What is the sum of numbers less than 2?
Answer: To find the sum of numbers less than 2, we first need to ensure that all the numbers given are indeed less than 2. In this case, 0.8, 1/2 (which is 0.5 when converted to a decimal), and 0.9 are all less than 2.

Now, let's add them up:

0.8 + 0.5 + 0.9 = 2.2

However, since we are looking for the sum of numbers less than 2, we have to stop and reconsider our calculation. The sum of 0.8, 0.5, and 0.9 actually exceeds 2, which means we've made a mistake. Let's try again:

0.8 + 0.5 + 0.9 = 2.2

This is incorrect because we are not supposed to find the sum that is less than 2, but rather the sum of the numbers, each of which is less than 2. Since all the numbers given (0.8, 1/2, and 0.9) are less than 2, we can sum them up directly:

0.8 + 0.5 + 0.9 = 2.2

So, the correct sum of the numbers 0.8, 1/2, and 0.9 is 2.2.

Question: The two people decided to meet at an amusement park. Person A came at 3 kilometers (km) per hour, person B came at 4 kilometers (km) per hour. The distance between person B and the amusement park is 2 kilometers (km) longer than the distance between person A and the amusement park. If the two people took 4 hours together, what is the distance between the amusement park and Person B's house?
Answer: Let's denote the distance between Person A and the amusement park as \( d \) kilometers. Therefore, the distance between Person B and the amusement park is \( d + 2 \) kilometers.

Since they took 4 hours together to meet at the amusement park, we can set up the following equations based on their speeds and the time it took for each to travel:

For Person A:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]
\[ 3 = \frac{d}{t_A} \]
\[ t_A = \frac{d}{3} \]

For Person B:
\[ 4 = \frac{d + 2}{t_B} \]
\[ t_B = \frac{d + 2}{4} \]

Since they took 4 hours together, we can add their times to equal 4 hours:
\[ t_A + t_B = 4 \]
\[ \frac{d}{3} + \frac{d + 2}{4} = 4 \]

To solve for \( d \), we need to find a common denominator and combine the fractions:
\[ \frac{4d}{12} + \frac{3(d + 2)}{12} = 4 \]
\[ \frac{4d + 3d + 6}{12} = 4 \]
\[ 7d + 6 = 48 \]
\[ 7d = 42 \]
\[ d = 6 \]

So, the distance between Person A and the amusement park is 6 kilometers. Therefore, the distance between Person B and the amusement park is \( d + 2 \), which is \( 6 + 2 = 8 \) kilometers.

Person B's house is 8 kilometers away from the amusement park.
Question: There are two numbers 0.8, 1/2. How many numbers are less than 3?

Question: When 11 is divided by the natural number A, the remainder is 2 and the quotient is 3. Find the value of A at this time.
Answer: To find the value of A, we can use the formula for division:

Dividend = (Divisor × Quotient) + Remainder

In this case, the dividend is 11, the quotient is 3, and the remainder is 2. Let's denote the divisor by A. Plugging in the values we have:

11 = (A × 3) + 2

Now, we can solve for A:

11 - 2 = A × 3
9 = A × 3
A = 9 / 3
A = 3

So the value of A is 3.
Question: There is a barrel with 10.4 kilograms (kg) of water. If you want to divide this water by 0.8 kg (kg) into each small bucket, how many buckets are needed?
Answer: To find out how many buckets are needed, you divide the total amount of water by the amount of water each bucket can hold.

Total amount of water = 10.4 kg
Amount of water per bucket = 0.8 kg

Number of buckets needed = Total amount of water / Amount of water per bucket
Number of buckets needed = 10.4 kg / 0.8 kg
Number of buckets needed = 13

So, you would need 13 buckets to divide 10.4 kg of water into 0.8 kg portions.
Question: When we divide 17 by 5, the quotient is 3, and the remainder is A. Find A here.
Answer: When we divide 17 by 5, we can calculate the remainder as follows:

17 divided by 5 gives us a quotient of 3 and a remainder. To find the remainder, we multiply the quotient by the divisor and subtract that product from the original number:

17 - (5 * 3) = 17 - 15 = 2

So, the remainder A is 2.

Question: Seonho wants to cut 1 large cube of wood into several small cubes of wood. The length of a side of a small block of wood is 1/4 of the length of a side of a block of large wood. Find the number of small wooden blocks that can be made at this time.
Answer: To find the number of small cubes that can be made from the large cube, we need to determine how many times the volume of a small cube fits into the volume of the large cube.

Let's denote the length of a side of the large cube as L. Then the length of a side of a small cube would be L/4.

The volume of the large cube (V_large) is:
V_large = L^3

The volume of a small cube (V_small) is:
V_small = (L/4)^3
V_small = L^3/64

Now, to find the number of small cubes that can be made from the large cube, we divide the volume of the large cube by the volume of the small cube:

Number of small cubes = V_large / V_small
Number of small cubes = L^3 / (L^3/64)
Number of small cubes = 64

So, Seonho can make 64 small cubes from the large cube.
Question: There are 28 identical egg containers in the mart. Each egg container has the same number of eggs. When you select the 14th egg from the front, the 20th from the back, the 3rd from the left, and the 2nd from the right in an egg container, find all the number of eggs in the egg containers at this mart.
Answer: To solve this problem, we need to determine the dimensions of the egg container in terms of the number of eggs it can hold in each direction: front-to-back, left-to-right, and the total number of layers (since we are only given information about two dimensions, we'll assume there's only one layer of eggs).

Let's denote the number of eggs from front to back as F, and the number of eggs from left to right as L.

From the information given:
- The 14th egg from the front is the same as the 20th from the back. This means there are 14 + 20 - 1 = 33 eggs from front to back (we subtract 1 because the 14th egg from the front and the 20th from the back are the same egg).
- The 3rd egg from the left is the same as the 2nd from the right. This means there are 3 + 2 - 1 = 4 eggs from left to right (again, we subtract 1 for the same reason).

So, each egg container has 33 eggs from front to back and 4 eggs from left to right. Assuming there's only one layer of eggs, the total number of eggs in each container is F * L = 33 * 4 = 132 eggs.

Since there are 28 identical egg containers, the total number of eggs in all the containers at the mart is 28 * 132 = 3696 eggs.
Question: Chinese cabbage was planted on 2/7 of the field and eggplant on 3/8. Cabbage or eggplant, which planted area is larger?
Answer: To compare the planted areas of Chinese cabbage and eggplant, we need to compare the fractions 2/7 and 3/8.

To compare these fractions, we can find a common denominator or convert them to decimals.

Let's convert them to decimals for easier comparison:

For Chinese cabbage: 2/7 = 0.2857 (rounded to four decimal places)
For eggplant: 3/8 = 0.375

Now we can clearly see that 0.375 (eggplant) is greater than 0.2857 (Chinese cabbage).

Therefore, the planted area for eggplant is larger than the planted area for Chinese cabbage.

Question: Some number minus 7 returns 9. What will be the answer if the number is multiplied by 5?
Answer: Let's call the number we're looking for "x". According to the first statement:

x - 7 = 9

To find x, we add 7 to both sides of the equation:

x = 9 + 7
x = 16

Now, if we multiply this number by 5:

16 * 5 = 80

So the answer is 80.
Question: The sum of the lengths of all the edges of the cube equals 72 centimeters (cm). If you select two faces of this cube that touch each other, find the length in centimeters (cm) of the line segment that forms the boundary.
Answer: A cube has 12 edges, and since it's a regular solid, all edges are of equal length. If the sum of the lengths of all the edges equals 72 cm, then the length of one edge can be found by dividing 72 cm by 12.

Length of one edge = 72 cm / 12 = 6 cm

Two faces that touch each other on a cube share a common edge. The length of the line segment that forms the boundary between these two faces is the length of this common edge.

Therefore, the length of the line segment that forms the boundary between two touching faces of the cube is 6 cm.
Question: In the relay, Siwon ran 3/10 of the track, and Dawon ran 4/10 of the track. If the distance Siwon and Dawon run is 140 meters (m), what is the total distance of the relay race?
Answer: Let's denote the total distance of the relay race as D.

Siwon ran 3/10 of the track, and Dawon ran 4/10 of the track. Together, they ran 3/10 + 4/10 = 7/10 of the track.

We know that 7/10 of the track is equal to 140 meters. So we can set up the following equation:

(7/10) * D = 140 m

To find the total distance D, we divide both sides of the equation by 7/10:

D = 140 m / (7/10)

To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal. The reciprocal of 7/10 is 10/7. So we have:

D = 140 m * (10/7)

Now we multiply:

D = 1400 m / 7

D = 200 m

Therefore, the total distance of the relay race is 200 meters.

Question: How many four-digit numbers can be formed by using 1, 3, 6, and 8 only once?
Answer: To form a four-digit number using the digits 1, 3, 6, and 8, each digit must be used exactly once. 

For the first digit (the thousands place), we have 4 choices (1, 3, 6, or 8). 
For the second digit (the hundreds place), we have 3 remaining choices (since one digit has already been used for the thousands place). 
For the third digit (the tens place), we have 2 remaining choices (since two digits have already been used for the thousands and hundreds places). 
For the fourth digit (the ones place), we have only 1 remaining choice (since three digits have already been used for the thousands, hundreds, and tens places).

Therefore, the total number of four-digit numbers that can be formed is the product of the number of choices for each place:

4 (choices for the first digit) × 3 (choices for the second digit) × 2 (choices for the third digit) × 1 (choice for the fourth digit) = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24.

So, 24 different four-digit numbers can be formed using the digits 1, 3, 6, and 8, each used only once.
Question: 6 friends and Yuna are standing in a line. If there are 2 friends in front of Yuna, find how many friends are behind Yuna.
Answer: If there are 2 friends in front of Yuna, and there are 6 friends in total, then the number of friends behind Yuna would be:

Total friends - Friends in front of Yuna = Friends behind Yuna
6 - 2 = 4

So, there are 4 friends behind Yuna.
Question: Find the sum of A and B. 3/7=6/A=B/21
Answer: To find the sum of A and B, we first need to solve for A and B using the given equations:

1. 3/7 = 6/A
2. B/21 = 6/A

From equation 1, we can solve for A:
3/7 = 6/A
A = 6 / (3/7)
A = 6 * (7/3)
A = 2 * 7
A = 14

Now that we have A, we can use equation 2 to solve for B:
B/21 = 6/A
B/21 = 6/14
B/21 = 3/7
B = 3/7 * 21
B = 3 * 3
B = 9

Now that we have both A and B, we can find their sum:
A + B = 14 + 9
A + B = 23

The sum of A and B is 23.

Question: Jimin's social studies score is 6 points higher than his science score. The science score is 87. If the average score for science, social studies, and English is 92, what is his English score?
Answer: First, let's find Jimin's social studies score. Since it is 6 points higher than his science score, we can calculate it as follows:

Social Studies Score = Science Score + 6
Social Studies Score = 87 + 6
Social Studies Score = 93

Now we know his science score is 87 and his social studies score is 93.

The average score for science, social studies, and English is given as 92. The average is calculated by adding all the scores together and then dividing by the number of subjects. In this case, there are 3 subjects.

Let's denote Jimin's English score as E.

The average is calculated as follows:

Average = (Science Score + Social Studies Score + English Score) / Number of Subjects
92 = (87 + 93 + E) / 3

Now we solve for E:

92 = (180 + E) / 3
92 * 3 = 180 + E
276 = 180 + E
E = 276 - 180
E = 96

Jimin's English score is 96.
Question: A rectangle has a sum of 4 sides equal to 38 centimeters (cm). If the long side of this rectangle is 12 centimeters (cm), how many centimeters (cm) is the short side?
Answer: Let's denote the long side of the rectangle as L and the short side as S. According to the problem, we have:

L = 12 cm

The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

P = 2L + 2S

We are given that the sum of the four sides (the perimeter) is 38 cm, so:

38 cm = 2L + 2S

Now, we can substitute the value of L into the equation:

38 cm = 2(12 cm) + 2S
38 cm = 24 cm + 2S

Next, we'll solve for S:

2S = 38 cm - 24 cm
2S = 14 cm

Now, divide both sides by 2 to find the value of S:

S = 14 cm / 2
S = 7 cm

Therefore, the short side of the rectangle is 7 centimeters long.
Question: You want to create a three-digit number by selecting three numbers from 0, 2, 4, and 6. If only the number can be used once, find the product of the largest possible number and the smallest possible number.
Answer: To create the largest possible three-digit number using the digits 0, 2, 4, and 6, we should place the largest digits at the most significant places. Therefore, the largest number would be 642.

To create the smallest possible three-digit number using the digits 0, 2, 4, and 6, we should place the smallest non-zero digit at the most significant place, because we cannot use 0 as the first digit of a three-digit number. Therefore, the smallest number would be 204.

Now, we find the product of the largest and smallest numbers:

642 * 204 = 130968

So, the product of the largest possible number and the smallest possible number is 130968.

Answer: Let's call the number we are looking for "x". According to the problem, if we add -5/12 to x and then subtract -5/2 from the result, we get 1/3. We can write this as an equation:

x + (-5/12) - (-5/2) = 1/3

First, let's simplify the equation by removing the parentheses and remembering that subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive:

x - 5/12 + 5/2 = 1/3

Now, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions so that we can combine them. The least common denominator (LCD) for 12, 2, and 3 is 12. So we convert each fraction to have a denominator of 12:

x - 5/12 + (5/2) * (6/6) = (1/3) * (4/4)

x - 5/12 + 30/12 = 4/12

Now we can combine the fractions:

x + (30/12 - 5/12) = 4/12

x + 25/12 = 4/12

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 25/12 from both sides:

x = 4/12 - 25/12

x = (-21/12)

Now we can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:

x = (-21 ÷ 3) / (12 ÷ 3)

x = -7/4

So the number we are looking for is -7/4.
Question: There are ribbons with lengths of 36 centimeters (cm), 42 centimeters (cm), and 48 centimeters (cm), respectively. I cut 1/6 of this ribbons and tied the remaining pieces together to make one long ribbon. The length of the ribbon made is 97 centimeters (cm). Find how many centimeters (cm) are used to tie the ribbons together.
Answer: First, let's find out how much of each ribbon was cut off:

For the 36 cm ribbon, 1/6 of it is cut off:
36 cm * (1/6) = 6 cm

For the 42 cm ribbon, 1/6 of it is cut off:
42 cm * (1/6) = 7 cm

For the 48 cm ribbon, 1/6 of it is cut off:
48 cm * (1/6) = 8 cm

Now, let's find out the remaining length of each ribbon after cutting:

For the 36 cm ribbon:
36 cm - 6 cm = 30 cm

For the 42 cm ribbon:
42 cm - 7 cm = 35 cm

For the 48 cm ribbon:
48 cm - 8 cm = 40 cm

Next, let's add up the remaining lengths of the ribbons to find the total length before tying them together:

30 cm + 35 cm + 40 cm = 105 cm

The total length of the ribbon made after tying them together is given as 97 cm. This means that the length used to tie the ribbons together is the difference between the total length before tying and the length after tying:

105 cm - 97 cm = 8 cm

Therefore, 8 centimeters (cm) are used to tie the ribbons together.
Question: Jungkook and Eunji are trying to share pieces of colored paper. When there are 15 pieces of colored paper, how many ways are there to divide them so that Jungkook and Eunji both have at least one piece?
Answer: To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ways to divide 15 pieces of colored paper between Jungkook and Eunji such that both have at least one piece.

Let's denote the number of pieces Jungkook gets as J and the number of pieces Eunji gets as E. Since both must have at least one piece, we have the following constraints:

1 ≤ J ≤ 14
1 ≤ E ≤ 14
J + E = 15

Since J and E must add up to 15 and both must have at least one piece, we can simply find the number of ways to give Jungkook any number from 1 to 14 pieces, and the rest will automatically go to Eunji.

For example:
- If Jungkook gets 1 piece, Eunji gets 14 pieces.
- If Jungkook gets 2 pieces, Eunji gets 13 pieces.
-...
- If Jungkook gets 14 pieces, Eunji gets 1 piece.

There are 14 possible ways to divide the 15 pieces of colored paper between Jungkook and Eunji while satisfying the condition that both have at least one piece.

Question: Suhwan's car traveled 15.5 kilometers (km) in 10 minutes. How many kilometers (km) would he travel in 46 minutes at this speed?
Answer: To find out how many kilometers Suhwan would travel in 46 minutes at the same speed, we first need to determine his speed in kilometers per minute.

He traveled 15.5 kilometers in 10 minutes, so his speed is:

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 15.5 km / 10 min
Speed = 1.55 km/min

Now that we know his speed, we can calculate how far he would travel in 46 minutes:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 1.55 km/min * 46 min
Distance = 71.3 km

So, Suhwan would travel 71.3 kilometers in 46 minutes at this speed.
Question: Yoongi had 4 apples, Yuna had 5, and Jungkook had 6, but he ate 3 of them. Who has the fewest apples?
Answer: After Jungkook ate 3 of his 6 apples, he was left with 3 apples. Since Yoongi had 4 apples and Yuna had 5, Jungkook now has the fewest apples with 3.
Question: There is a regular pentagon with a side length of 15 centimeters (cm). Find the perimeter of this figure in centimeters (cm).
Answer: The perimeter of a polygon is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. Since a regular pentagon has five equal sides, we can find the perimeter by multiplying the length of one side by the number of sides.

In this case, the side length of the pentagon is 15 cm. Therefore, the perimeter P of the pentagon is:

P = 5 * side length
P = 5 * 15 cm
P = 75 cm

So, the perimeter of the regular pentagon is 75 cm.

Question: Divide this number by 2.5, subtract 10.5 from it, and multiply that by 0.3 to get 5.85. Find this number.
Answer: Let's call the number you're looking for "x". According to the instructions, we first divide x by 2.5, then subtract 10.5 from the result, and finally multiply that result by 0.3 to get 5.85. We can write this as an equation:

0.3 * ((x / 2.5) - 10.5) = 5.85

Now, let's solve for x step by step.

First, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 0.3 to isolate the term with x:

((x / 2.5) - 10.5) = 5.85 / 0.3

Now, calculate 5.85 / 0.3:

((x / 2.5) - 10.5) = 19.5

Next, we'll add 10.5 to both sides to isolate the term with x:

(x / 2.5) = 19.5 + 10.5

(x / 2.5) = 30

Now, we'll multiply both sides by 2.5 to solve for x:

x = 30 * 2.5

x = 75

So, the number you're looking for is 75.
Question: Among the natural numbers from 1 to 100, what is the third largest number with a remainder of 2 when divided by 5?
Answer: To find the natural numbers with a remainder of 2 when divided by 5, we look for numbers that are of the form 5n + 2, where n is a non-negative integer.

Starting from the largest number less than 100 that satisfies this condition, we have:

98 = 5 * 19 + 3 (remainder is not 2)
97 = 5 * 19 + 2 (remainder is 2, so this is the largest number with a remainder of 2)
96 = 5 * 19 + 1 (remainder is not 2)
95 = 5 * 19 (remainder is 0)
94 = 5 * 18 + 4 (remainder is not 2)
93 = 5 * 18 + 3 (remainder is not 2)
92 = 5 * 18 + 2 (remainder is 2, so this is the second largest number with a remainder of 2)
91 = 5 * 18 + 1 (remainder is not 2)
90 = 5 * 18 (remainder is 0)
89 = 5 * 17 + 4 (remainder is not 2)
88 = 5 * 17 + 3 (remainder is not 2)
87 = 5 * 17 + 2 (remainder is 2, so this is the third largest number with a remainder of 2)

Therefore, the third largest number with a remainder of 2 when divided by 5 among the natural numbers from 1 to 100 is 87.
Question: Giyoon prepared some chocolates to distribute equally to 8 of her friends who decided to do volunteering together. But 2 people didn't come, so she gave one more chocolate to each person, and there were 4 chocolates left. How many chocolates did Giyoon prepare?
Answer: Let's denote the number of chocolates Giyoon prepared as C.

Originally, she planned to distribute the chocolates equally among 8 friends. However, only 6 friends showed up (8 - 2 = 6).

Since she gave one more chocolate to each of the 6 friends and had 4 chocolates left, we can set up the following equation:

C = 6 * (original number of chocolates per person + 1) + 4

Let's denote the original number of chocolates per person as X. Then, the equation becomes:

C = 6 * (X + 1) + 4

We also know that originally, the chocolates were to be distributed equally among 8 friends, so:

C = 8 * X

Now we have two expressions for C, which must be equal:

8 * X = 6 * (X + 1) + 4

Expanding the equation:

8X = 6X + 6 + 4

Subtract 6X from both sides:

2X = 10

Divide both sides by 2:

X = 5

Now that we know the original number of chocolates per person (X) was 5, we can find the total number of chocolates (C) that Giyoon prepared:

C = 8 * X
C = 8 * 5
C = 40

Giyoon prepared 40 chocolates.
Question: I should have subtracted 23, but I mistakenly subtracted 32 from some number and got 25. How much do you get when calculated correctly?

Question: The TV license fee is 30 won per 10 seconds. If Mingyu watched TV for 2 minutes and 40 seconds, how much would the license fee be?
Answer: First, we need to convert the time Mingyu watched TV into seconds. 

2 minutes and 40 seconds is equal to (2 * 60) + 40 seconds, which is 120 + 40 seconds, totaling 160 seconds.

Now, we know the TV license fee is 30 won per 10 seconds. To find out how many 10-second intervals are in 160 seconds, we divide 160 by 10, which gives us 16 intervals.

Finally, we multiply the number of intervals by the fee per interval to find the total cost:

16 intervals * 30 won per interval = 480 won

So, the license fee for watching TV for 2 minutes and 40 seconds would be 480 won.
Question: On the first day, 318 liters (L) of water were added to the pool, and on the second day, 312 liters (L) of water were added. On the third day, 180 liters (L) of water were added in the morning and 162 liters (L) in the afternoon. How many liters (L) of water were added to the pool on average each day?
Answer: To find the average amount of water added to the pool each day, we first need to calculate the total amount of water added over the three days and then divide that total by the number of days.

On the first day, 318 liters were added.
On the second day, 312 liters were added.
On the third day, a total of 180 liters + 162 liters = 342 liters were added.

Now, let's add up the total amount of water added over the three days:
318 liters + 312 liters + 342 liters = 972 liters

Next, we divide the total amount of water by the number of days to find the average:
972 liters / 3 days = 324 liters per day

So, on average, 324 liters of water were added to the pool each day.
Question: There are 135.1 liters (L) of water. If this is divided into 7 liters (L) buckets of water, how many buckets can be filled?
Answer: To find out how many 7-liter buckets can be filled with 135.1 liters of water, you divide the total amount of water by the capacity of each bucket:

135.1 liters ÷ 7 liters/bucket = 19.3 buckets

Since you can't have a fraction of a bucket, you can only completely fill 19 buckets with 7 liters each. The remaining water would not be enough to fill another full 7-liter bucket.
Question: You have five numbers 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. What is the sum of the largest number and the second smallest number?

14 + 11 = 25

So, the sum of the largest number and the second smallest number is 25.

Question: It is said that Gyeonghun climbed the mountain at a speed of 3 kilometers (km) per hour when going up, and 4 kilometers (km) per hour when going down as he changed the route, which takes 2 kilometers (km) longer than the previous one. If he took a total of 4 hours for climbing, how long did it take to go up?
Answer: Let's denote the time it took Gyeonghun to go up the mountain as \( t_{up} \) hours and the time to go down as \( t_{down} \) hours. We know that the total time for the climb is 4 hours, so:

\[ t_{up} + t_{down} = 4 \]

We also know that Gyeonghun's speed going up is 3 km/h and going down is 4 km/h. Let's denote the distance going up as \( d_{up} \) km and the distance going down as \( d_{down} \) km. We are told that the route going down is 2 km longer than the route going up, so:

\[ d_{down} = d_{up} + 2 \]

Using the relationship between speed, distance, and time, we can express the time taken to go up and down in terms of distance:

\[ t_{up} = \frac{d_{up}}{3} \]
\[ t_{down} = \frac{d_{down}}{4} \]

Now we can substitute \( d_{down} \) in terms of \( d_{up} \) into the second equation:

\[ t_{down} = \frac{d_{up} + 2}{4} \]

Now we have two equations with two variables (\( t_{up} \) and \( d_{up} \)). We can substitute \( t_{up} \) and \( t_{down} \) into the first equation:

\[ \frac{d_{up}}{3} + \frac{d_{up} + 2}{4} = 4 \]

To solve for \( d_{up} \), we need to find a common denominator and combine the fractions:

\[ \frac{4d_{up}}{12} + \frac{3(d_{up} + 2)}{12} = 4 \]

\[ \frac{4d_{up} + 3d_{up} + 6}{12} = 4 \]

\[ 7d_{up} + 6 = 48 \]

\[ 7d_{up} = 42 \]

\[ d_{up} = 6 \]

Now that we have \( d_{up} \), we can find \( t_{up} \):

\[ t_{up} = \frac{d_{up}}{3} \]

\[ t_{up} = \frac{6}{3} \]

\[ t_{up} = 2 \]

So, it took Gyeonghun 2 hours to go up the mountain.
Question: Jimin, Yoongi, Taehyung, and Namjoon all live in the same apartment. When Jimin's house is higher than Yoongi's, Taehyung's is lower than Namjoon's, and Yoongi's is higher than Namjoon's, who lives on the lowest floor?
Answer: Based on the information provided:

1. Jimin's house is higher than Yoongi's.
2. Taehyung's is lower than Namjoon's.
3. Yoongi's is higher than Namjoon's.

From point 3, we know Yoongi lives higher than Namjoon. From point 2, Taehyung lives lower than Namjoon. Therefore, Taehyung must live on a lower floor than both Yoongi and Namjoon. Since there is no information suggesting that anyone lives lower than Taehyung, we can conclude that Taehyung lives on the lowest floor.

Question: When you multiply a number by 7 and then add 21.28, you get 50.68. Find a number.
Answer: Let's call the number you're looking for "x". According to the problem, when you multiply this number by 7 and then add 21.28, you get 50.68. We can write this as an equation:

7x + 21.28 = 50.68

Now, we want to solve for x. First, we'll subtract 21.28 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with x:

7x + 21.28 - 21.28 = 50.68 - 21.28
7x = 29.40

Next, we'll divide both sides by 7 to solve for x:

7x / 7 = 29.40 / 7
x = 4.2

So the number you're looking for is 4.2.
Question: The taxi driven by Boeun's father travels 100 kilometers (km) in 1 hour and 15 minutes. What is the average distance the taxi traveled in 1 hour in kilometers (km)?
Answer: To find the average distance the taxi traveled in 1 hour, we need to calculate the distance it would cover in that time based on the distance it covers in 1 hour and 15 minutes.

1 hour and 15 minutes is equal to 1 + (15/60) hours, which is 1.25 hours.

The taxi travels 100 km in 1.25 hours.

To find the distance traveled in 1 hour, we divide the total distance by the total time:

Distance in 1 hour = Total distance / Total time
Distance in 1 hour = 100 km / 1.25 hours
Distance in 1 hour = 80 km

So, the average distance the taxi traveled in 1 hour is 80 kilometers.
Question: When one ball is drawn from a bag containing 12 balls each of which is written each of natural numbers from 1 to 12 and put back in and then draw one ball again, find the number of cases in which the number written on the first ball is less than 3, and the number written on the next ball is 10 or greater, 
Answer: To solve this problem, we need to consider the two separate events:

1. Drawing a ball with a number less than 3.
2. Drawing a ball with a number 10 or greater.

For the first event, there are only two balls with numbers less than 3: the balls numbered 1 and 2. So there are 2 possible outcomes for the first draw.

For the second event, there are three balls with numbers 10 or greater: the balls numbered 10, 11, and 12. So there are 3 possible outcomes for the second draw.

Since the ball is put back in the bag after the first draw, the two events are independent. To find the total number of cases where both events occur, we multiply the number of outcomes for the first event by the number of outcomes for the second event.

Total number of cases = (Number of outcomes for the first event) * (Number of outcomes for the second event)
Total number of cases = 2 * 3
Total number of cases = 6

So there are 6 cases in which the number written on the first ball is less than 3, and the number written on the next ball is 10 or greater.

Answer: Let's call the number we're looking for "x". According to the first statement:

x - 7 = 9

To find x, we add 7 to both sides of the equation:

x = 9 + 7
x = 16

Now, if we multiply this number by 5:

16 * 5 = 80

So the answer is 80.

Question: Fifteen sheets of colored tape, each 25 centimeters (cm) long, were joined together with an overlap of 0.5 centimeters (cm). How many meters (m) is the total length of the continuous color tape?
Answer: To find the total length of the continuous colored tape, we need to subtract the overlap from each sheet of tape and then add them all together.

Each sheet of tape is 25 cm long, and there is an overlap of 0.5 cm for each connection between two sheets. Since there are 15 sheets, there will be 14 overlaps (because the first sheet doesn't need to overlap with a previous one).

The total length of overlap for all the sheets is:
14 overlaps * 0.5 cm/overlap = 7 cm

Now, we subtract the total overlap from the total length of the 15 sheets if there were no overlaps:
Total length without overlaps = 15 sheets * 25 cm/sheet = 375 cm

Subtracting the overlaps:
Total length with overlaps = 375 cm - 7 cm = 368 cm

To convert centimeters to meters, we divide by 100 (since there are 100 centimeters in a meter):
Total length in meters = 368 cm / 100 = 3.68 m

So, the total length of the continuous colored tape is 3.68 meters.
Question: One factory makes 500 teddy bears in 30 minutes and 800 bunny dolls in 1 hour. Find which one will produce more after 5 hours.
Answer: First, let's calculate the production rate for each toy.

For teddy bears:
500 teddy bears are produced in 30 minutes, which is half an hour. So in one hour, the factory would produce double that amount because there are two 30-minute intervals in an hour. 
500 teddy bears * 2 = 1000 teddy bears per hour.

For bunny dolls:
800 bunny dolls are produced in 1 hour.

Now, let's calculate the production for each toy after 5 hours.

For teddy bears:
1000 teddy bears/hour * 5 hours = 5000 teddy bears.

For bunny dolls:
800 bunny dolls/hour * 5 hours = 4000 bunny dolls.

After 5 hours, the factory will produce more teddy bears (5000) than bunny dolls (4000).
Question: Find the sum of the smallest and largest four-digit numbers that can be formed using all the number cards 0, 3, 4, and 8.
Answer: To form the smallest four-digit number using the digits 0, 3, 4, and 8, we cannot start with 0 because a four-digit number cannot begin with 0. So, we start with the next smallest digit, which is 3. After placing 3 in the thousand's place, we then place the remaining digits in ascending order to get the smallest number. So, the smallest number is 3048.

To form the largest four-digit number, we simply arrange the digits in descending order. So, the largest number is 8430.

Now, we find the sum of the smallest and largest numbers:

3048 (smallest number)
+ 8430 (largest number)
---------
= 11478

So, the sum of the smallest and largest four-digit numbers that can be formed using all the number cards 0, 3, 4, and 8 is 11,478.

Question: When you wrongly multiplied a number that should have been divided by 2.4, you got 288. What is the correctly calculated value divided by 5?
Answer: If you multiplied a number by 2.4 instead of dividing by 2.4 and got 288, we can find the original number by dividing 288 by 2.4:

\( \frac{288}{2.4} = 120 \)

So the original number, before you should have divided by 2.4, is 120.

Now, to find the correctly calculated value divided by 5, we first need to divide the original number by 2.4, as it should have been:

\( \frac{120}{2.4} = 50 \)

Then, we divide this result by 5:

\( \frac{50}{5} = 10 \)

So the correctly calculated value divided by 5 is 10.

Answer: Based on the information provided:

- Minyoung flew farther than Eunji.
- Eunji flew farther than Yoojung.
- Yuna flew farther than Yoojung.

From these statements, we can deduce that Yoojung did not fly farther than anyone else mentioned. Therefore, Yoojung was the bottom person in the competition.

Answer: Let's denote the total amount of money Wooyoung had at first as \( X \) won.

At the first store, he spent \( \frac{X}{2} + 200 \) won. So, the remaining money after the first store is \( X - (\frac{X}{2} + 200) \).

At the second store, he spent \( 300 \) won more than half of the remaining money. The remaining money after the first store is \( X - (\frac{X}{2} + 200) \), so half of that is \( \frac{X - (\frac{X}{2} + 200)}{2} \). Therefore, he spent \( \frac{X - (\frac{X}{2} + 200)}{2} + 300 \) won at the second store.

After spending at the second store, he was left with 350 won. So, the remaining money after the second store is \( X - (\frac{X}{2} + 200) - (\frac{X - (\frac{X}{2} + 200)}{2} + 300) = 350 \).

Let's solve for \( X \):

\[ X - (\frac{X}{2} + 200) - (\frac{X - (\frac{X}{2} + 200)}{2} + 300) = 350 \]

\[ X - \frac{X}{2} - 200 - \frac{X}{2} + \frac{200}{2} - 300 = 350 \]

\[ X - \frac{X}{2} - \frac{X}{2} - 200 + 100 - 300 = 350 \]

\[ X - X - 200 - 100 + 100 = 350 \]

\[ -200 = 350 \]

This equation does not make sense because we cannot have a negative initial amount of money. It seems there was a mistake in the simplification. Let's try again and simplify step by step:

\[ X - (\frac{X}{2} + 200) - (\frac{X - (\frac{X}{2} + 200)}{2} + 300) = 350 \]

\[ X - \frac{X}{2} - 200 - \frac{X}{2} + \frac{200}{2} - 300 = 350 \]

\[ X - \frac{X}{2} - \frac{X}{2} - 200 + 100 - 300 = 350 \]

\[ X - X - 200 + 100 - 300 = 350 \]

\[ -X + X - 400 = 350 \]

\[ -400 = 350 \]

This still doesn't make sense. Let's try to solve the equation correctly:

\[ X - (\frac{X}{2} + 200) - (\frac{X - (\frac{X}{2} + 200)}{2} + 300) = 350 \]

\[ X - \frac{X}{2} - 200 - \frac{1}{2}(X - \frac{X}{2} - 200) - 300 = 350 \]

\[ X - \frac{X}{2} - 200 - \frac{1}{2}X + \frac{1}{4}X + 100 - 300 = 350 \]

\[ X - \frac{1}{2}X - \frac{1}{2}X + \frac{1}{4}X - 200 + 100 - 300 = 350 \]

\[ \frac{1}{4}X - 400 = 350 \]

\[ \frac{1}{4}X = 350 + 400 \]

\[ \frac{1}{4}X = 750 \]

\[ X = 750 \times 4 \]

\[ X = 3000 \]

So, Wooyoung had 3000 won at first.
Question: When a number is divided by 6, it becomes 1/10. What is the value of the number divided by 3/25?
Answer: 1/10 = 0.1. So, the number divided by 6 is 0.1. To find the number, we multiply both sides by 6:

\[ \frac{x}{6} = 0.1 \]

\[ x = 0.1

Question: You made 5 identical rectangles by cutting a square-shaped paper whose side is 40 centimeters (cm) long. How many centimeters (cm) is the length of the shorter side of a rectangle when it has the largest area?
Answer: To maximize the area of the rectangles, we need to cut the square in such a way that the rectangles are as large as possible. Since we are making 5 identical rectangles, we have a few options on how to cut the square. We can cut the square into 5 strips either along its length or its width.

The area of the square is \(40 \text{ cm} \times 40 \text{ cm} = 1600 \text{ cm}^2\). When we divide this area by 5 to get the area of each rectangle, we get \(1600 \text{ cm}^2 / 5 = 320 \text{ cm}^2\) for each rectangle.

Now, let's consider the possible ways to cut the square to create the rectangles:

1. Cut the square into 5 strips along its length (40 cm side). Each strip would then have a length of 40 cm and a width of \(40 \text{ cm} / 5 = 8 \text{ cm}\). The area of each rectangle would be \(40 \text{ cm} \times 8 \text{ cm} = 320 \text{ cm}^2\), which matches our calculated area for each rectangle.

2. Cut the square into 5 strips along its width (40 cm side). This would result in the same dimensions as the first option, with each rectangle having a length of 40 cm and a width of 8 cm.

Since the question asks for the length of the shorter side of the rectangle when it has the largest area, and we've determined that the area is maximized when the rectangles are cut along the length or width of the square, the length of the shorter side of the rectangle is 8 cm.
Question: Sunghoon took the midterm exam. When Sunghoon's Korean score is divided by his math score and the quotient is 1.2, and when his math score is divided by his English score and the quotient is 5/6. If you divide his Korean score by his English score, what is the quotient?
Answer: Let's denote Sunghoon's Korean score as K, his math score as M, and his English score as E.

From the information given, we have two equations:

1) K/M = 1.2
2) M/E = 5/6

We need to find K/E.

From equation 1), we can express M in terms of K:
M = K/1.2

From equation 2), we can express E in terms of M:
E = M/(5/6)
E = M * (6/5)

Now, we substitute M = K/1.2 into the equation for E:
E = (K/1.2) * (6/5)
E = K * (6/5) * (1/1.2)
E = K * (6/5) * (5/6)  (since 1.2 = 6/5)
E = K * (6/5) * (5/6)
E = K * (6*5)/(5*6)
E = K * (30/30)
E = K * 1
E = K

Now, we need to find K/E, but since E = K, the quotient of K divided by E (K/E) is:
K/E = K/K
K/E = 1

Therefore, the quotient when Sunghoon's Korean score is divided by his English score is 1.
Question: Find the sum of A and B. 3/7=6/A=B/21
Answer: To find the sum of A and B, we first need to solve for A and B using the given equations:

1. 3/7 = 6/A
2. B/21 = 6/A

From equation 1, we can solve for A:
3/7 = 6/A
A = 6 / (3/7)
A = 6 * (7/3)
A = 2 * 7
A = 14

Now that we have A, we can use equation 2 to solve for B:
B/21 = 6/A
B/21 = 6/14
B/21 = 3/7
B = 3/7 * 21
B = 3 * 3
B = 9

Now that we have both A and B, we can find their sum:
A + B = 14 + 9
A + B = 23

The sum of A and B is 23.
Question: I have to divide a number by 8, but I accidentally multiply a number by 6 is 96. What is the correct calculation result?
Answer: 96 / 6 = 16

Since you accidentally multiplied a number by 6 to get 96, the correct calculation would be:

96 / 8 = 12

So, the correct calculation result is 12. However, since you accidentally multiplied the number by 6, you

Question: When Hoseok divides a number by 6, he gets 11. Find what number is used by Hoseok.
Answer: If Hoseok divides a number by 6 and gets 11, we can set up the equation:

(number) / 6 = 11

To find the number, we multiply both sides of the equation by 6:

number = 11 * 6

number = 66

So, the number Hoseok used is 66.
Question: It took Daehyun 12 days to read the 288-page novel, and Seung-hoon took 9 days to read the 243-page novel. Find out who of the two read more pages in one day.
Answer: To find out who read more pages in one day, we need to calculate the number of pages each person read per day.

For Daehyun:
Total pages = 288
Total days = 12
Pages per day = Total pages / Total days
Pages per day = 288 / 12
Pages per day = 24

For Seung-hoon:
Total pages = 243
Total days = 9
Pages per day = Total pages / Total days
Pages per day = 243 / 9
Pages per day = 27

Seung-hoon read more pages in one day, with 27 pages per day, compared to Daehyun's 24 pages per day.
Question: Find the number of all diagonals in a heptagon.
Answer: A heptagon has 7 sides. To find the number of diagonals in a polygon, you can use the formula:

Number of diagonals = n(n - 3) / 2

where n is the number of sides in the polygon.

For a heptagon, n = 7. So, the number of diagonals is:

Number of diagonals = 7(7 - 3) / 2
Number of diagonals = 7(4) / 2
Number of diagonals = 28 / 2
Number of diagonals = 14

Therefore, a heptagon has 14 diagonals.

Question: I had to add 40 to a certain number, but I accidentally multiply 21 by that number and the result is 63. How much is it if I calculate it correctly?
Answer: Let's call the certain number "x". According to the information given, you accidentally multiplied 21 by x instead of adding 40 to x. The result of this incorrect operation was 63.

So the equation for the incorrect operation is:

21 * x = 63

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 21:

x = 63 / 21
x = 3

Now that we know x is 3, we can calculate the correct operation, which is adding 40 to x:

Correct result = x + 40
Correct result = 3 + 40
Correct result = 43

So if you calculate it correctly by adding 40 to the certain number, the result is 43.
Question: A number that should be divided by 4 is mistakenly divided by 8, so the quotient is 6 and the remainder is 4. What would be the correct answer?
Answer: If the number is mistakenly divided by 8, the quotient is 6 and the remainder is 4, we can write this as:

Number = 8 * Quotient + Remainder
Number = 8 * 6 + 4
Number = 48 + 4
Number = 52

So the original number is 52.

Now, if we divide this number correctly by 4, we can find the correct quotient and remainder:

Correct Quotient = Number / 4
Correct Quotient = 52 / 4
Correct Quotient = 13

Since 52 is exactly divisible by 4, the correct remainder will be 0.

Therefore, the correct answer when 52 is divided by 4 is a quotient of 13 and a remainder of 0.
Question: There is a shape consisting of 8 angles of the same size. If the side of this figure is 12 centimeters (cm), how many centimeters (cm) is the perimeter?
Answer: If the shape has 8 angles of the same size and each side is 12 cm, it is an octagon (an 8-sided polygon) with equal sides. To find the perimeter of any polygon, you add up the lengths of all its sides.

Since all sides of the octagon are equal and each side is 12 cm, the perimeter P of the octagon can be calculated as:

P = number of sides × length of one side
P = 8 × 12 cm
P = 96 cm

So, the perimeter of the octagon is 96 cm.
Question: When you multiply a number by 2, you get 18. What is the value of this number when you subtract 4?
Answer: 18 is the result of multiplying the number by 2. To find the number, we can divide 18 by 2:

Number = 18 / 2
Number = 9

Now, if we subtract 4 from this number, we can find the result:

Number - 4

Question: Find the number of ways to draw 3 people among Namjoon, Yoongi, Hoseok, and Minyoung and put them in a line.
Answer: To find the number of ways to draw 3 people from a group of 4 (Namjoon, Yoongi, Hoseok, and Minyoung) and put them in a line, we can use the formula for permutations since the order matters.

The number of permutations of n objects taken r at a time is given by:

nPr = n! / (n - r)!

In this case, n = 4 (the total number of people) and r = 3 (the number of people we want to draw and line up).

So, the number of ways to draw 3 people from 4 and put them in a line is:

4P3 = 4! / (4 - 3)!

Calculating the factorial:

4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24
(4 - 3)! = 1! = 1

Now, we calculate the permutation:

4P3 = 24 / 1 = 24

Therefore, there are 24 different ways to draw 3 people from the group of 4 and put them in a line.
Question: Hoseok subtracted 46 from a number to get 15. Find the exact result of subtracting 29 from this number.
Answer: Let's call the number Hoseok started with "x". According to the information given:

x - 46 = 15

To find the value of x, we add 46 to both sides of the equation:

x - 46 + 46 = 15 + 46
x = 61

Now, we want to subtract 29 from this number:

61 - 29 = 32

So, the exact result of subtracting 29 from the number is 32.
Question: There are 28 identical vending machines in the arcade. Each vending machine has the same number of beverages. When you selected the beverage that is 14th from the front, 20th from the back, 3rd from the top and 2nd from the bottom in a vending machine, find the total number of drinks in these arcade vending machines.
Answer: Let's first determine the total number of beverages in one vending machine.

If the selected beverage is 14th from the front and 20th from the back, we can add these two positions together to find the total number of beverages in a column (from front to back). However, we must subtract 1 because the selected beverage is counted twice (once from the front and once from the back).

Total beverages in a column (front to back) = 14 (from the front) + 20 (from the back) - 1 (to avoid double counting) = 33 beverages

Similarly, if the selected beverage is 3rd from the top and 2nd from the bottom, we can find the total number of rows (from top to bottom) in the same way:

Total rows (top to bottom) = 3 (from the top) + 2 (from the bottom) - 1 (to avoid double counting) = 4 rows

Now, we have 33 beverages in a column and 4 rows of such columns. To find the total number of beverages in one vending machine, we multiply the number of beverages in a column by the number of rows:

Total beverages in one vending machine = 33 beverages/column * 4 rows = 132 beverages

Since there are 28 identical vending machines in the arcade, we multiply the total number of beverages in one vending machine by the number of vending machines:

Total beverages in all vending machines = 132 beverages/vending machine * 28 vending machines = 3696 beverages

Therefore, there are a total of 3696 beverages in the arcade vending machines.
Question: It is said that it takes an hour to make 8 toys from one machine. How many hours would it take to make 200 toys using 5 machines?

Question: If there are 3 bus routes and 2 subway routes going from Seohee's house to school, find the number of ways to go by bus or subway.
Answer: To find the total number of ways Seohee can go to school by bus or subway, we simply add the number of bus routes to the number of subway routes.

Number of bus routes = 3
Number of subway routes = 2

Total number of ways = Number of bus routes + Number of subway routes
Total number of ways = 3 + 2
Total number of ways = 5

So, there are 5 different ways Seohee can go to school by bus or subway.
Question: How many full buckets are there when 135.1 liters (L) of water is divided into 7 liters (L) buckets?
Answer: To find out how many full 7-liter buckets can be filled with 135.1 liters of water, you divide the total amount of water by the capacity of each bucket.

135.1 liters ÷ 7 liters/bucket = 19.3 buckets

Since you can't have a fraction of a full bucket, you would have 19 full 7-liter buckets. The remaining 0.3 of a bucket would not be enough to fill another full 7-liter bucket.
Question: Choose three of the natural numbers 5, 3, 1, and 9 to form three-digit numbers. When writing the numbers in order from largest to smallest, find the 10th number.
Answer: To form three-digit numbers using the natural numbers 5, 3, 1, and 9, we can create various combinations. However, since we are interested in the 10th largest number, we should focus on creating the largest numbers first and then work our way down.

The largest digit we have is 9, so we should start by placing 9 in the hundreds place to get the largest possible numbers. The next largest digit is 5, followed by 3 and then 1. We can create numbers with these digits in the tens and ones places.

Let's list the numbers starting with 9 in the hundreds place, then with 5, and so on:

With 9 in the hundreds place:
1. 951
2. 953
3. 915
4. 913
5. 935
6. 931

With 5 in the hundreds place:
7. 593
8. 591
9. 539
10. 531

We can stop here because we have found the 10th largest number, which is 531.

Question: Consider Taehyung can move 0.45 meters (m) in one step. If he moved 90 steps for 13 times, find the distance he walked in meters (m).
Answer: First, let's find the distance Taehyung walks in one set of 90 steps:

Distance for 90 steps = Number of steps × Distance per step
Distance for 90 steps = 90 steps × 0.45 m/step
Distance for 90 steps = 40.5 m

Now, let's find the total distance he walked after doing this 13 times:

Total distance = Distance for 90 steps × Number of times
Total distance = 40.5 m × 13
Total distance = 526.5 m

So, Taehyung walked a total of 526.5 meters.
Question: How much is 1 dollar in Korean money when 140 dollars is converted into 158,760 won in Korean money?
Answer: To find out how much 1 dollar is in Korean won, we can divide the total amount in won by the number of dollars.

158,760 won / 140 dollars = 1,134 won per dollar

So, 1 dollar is equivalent to 1,134 won in Korean money.
Question: What is the surface area in square centimeters (cm2) of a cube whose lengths add up to 180 centimeters (cm)?
Answer: If the lengths of the edges of a cube add up to 180 cm, we can find the length of one edge by dividing that total by the number of edges that meet at each corner of the cube. Since a cube has 12 edges in total (4 edges on each of 3 layers), we can find the length of one edge by dividing 180 cm by 12.

Length of one edge = 180 cm / 12 = 15 cm

The surface area (SA) of a cube is calculated by the formula:

SA = 6 * (edge length)^2

Substituting the length of one edge into the formula, we get:

SA = 6 * (15 cm)^2
SA = 6 * 225 cm^2
SA = 1350 cm^2

So, the surface area of the cube is 1350 square centimeters.

Question: If the son's age is 1 year less than 1/4 of the father's age and the father's age is 5 years less than 5 times the son's age, how old is the son?
Answer: Let's denote the son's age as S and the father's age as F.

According to the first statement, the son's age is 1 year less than 1/4 of the father's age. This can be written as:
S = (1/4)F - 1 ...(1)

According to the second statement, the father's age is 5 years less than 5 times the son's age. This can be written as:
F = 5S - 5 ...(2)

Now, we can substitute the expression for F from equation (2) into equation (1) to solve for S:
S = (1/4)(5S - 5) - 1

Multiplying both sides by 4 to get rid of the fraction:
4S = 5S - 5 - 4

Now, let's move all terms involving S to one side and constants to the other side:
4S - 5S = -5 - 4

Combine like terms:
-S = -9

Now, divide both sides by -1 to solve for S:
S = 9

So, the son is 9 years old.
Question: Jungkook ate 3 out of 6 apples. If Yoongi has 4 apples and Yuna has 5 apples, whose apples are the fewest?

Question: The red tape is 11/6 meters (m), the blue tape is 7/4 meters (m), and the yellow tape is 13/8 meters (m). Which tape is the longest?
Answer: To determine which tape is the longest, we need to compare the lengths of the red, blue, and yellow tapes. Since the lengths are given as fractions, we can compare them by finding a common denominator or converting them to decimal form.

Let's convert each fraction to decimal form:

Red tape: 11/6 m = 1.8333... m (repeating)
Blue tape: 7/4 m = 1.75 m
Yellow tape: 13/8 m = 1.625 m

Now that we have the decimal equivalents, we can easily compare the lengths:

Red tape: 1.8333... m
Blue tape: 1.75 m
Yellow tape: 1.625 m

The red tape, at 1.8333... meters, is the longest.

Question: There is a shape consisting of 8 angles of the same size. If the side of this figure is 12 centimeters (cm), how many centimeters (cm) is the perimeter?
Answer: If the shape has 8 angles of the same size and each side is 12 cm, it is an octagon (an 8-sided polygon) with equal sides. To find the perimeter of any polygon, you add up the lengths of all its sides.

Since all sides of the octagon are equal and each side is 12 cm, the perimeter P of the octagon can be calculated as:

P = number of sides × length of one side
P = 8 × 12 cm
P = 96 cm

So, the perimeter of the octagon is 96 cm.
Question: There are buttons with two numbers written on them. The difference between the numbers on the buttons is 480. When you divide the larger number by the smaller number, you get a quotient of 4 and a remainder of 30. Find what the larger number is.
Answer: Let's denote the smaller number as \( x \) and the larger number as \( y \). According to the information given:

1. The difference between the numbers on the buttons is 480:
\[ y - x = 480 \]

2. When you divide the larger number by the smaller number, you get a quotient of 4 and a remainder of 30:
\[ y = 4x + 30 \]

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:

\[ \begin{cases} y - x = 480 \\ y = 4x + 30 \end{cases} \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first to find the value of \( x \):

\[ (4x + 30) - x = 480 \]
\[ 4x + 30 - x = 480 \]
\[ 3x + 30 = 480 \]
\[ 3x = 480 - 30 \]
\[ 3x = 450 \]
\[ x = \frac{450}{3} \]
\[ x = 150 \]

Now that we have the value of \( x \), we can find the value of \( y \) using the second equation:

\[ y = 4x + 30 \]
\[ y = 4(150) + 30 \]
\[ y = 600 + 30 \]
\[ y = 630 \]

So the larger number is 630.
Question: Fruit (d) is heavier than fruit (a) and lighter than fruit (b). Fruit (b) is lighter than fruit (c). Which fruit is the lightest?
Answer: Given the information:

1. Fruit (d) is heavier than fruit (a).
2. Fruit (d) is lighter than fruit (b).
3. Fruit (b) is lighter than fruit (c).

From point 1 and 2, we can deduce that fruit (a) is lighter than both fruit (d) and fruit (b). From point 3, we know that fruit (b) is lighter than fruit (c), but since fruit (a) is lighter than fruit (b), it must also be lighter than fruit (c).

Therefore, fruit (a) is the lightest.

Question: Seonwoo's school's 3rd graders have 4 classes with 21 students in each class. All 3rd graders are trying to plant 2 seeds in their pots. How many seeds do they need in all?
Answer: There are 4 classes of 3rd graders with 21 students in each class. To find the total number of 3rd graders, we multiply the number of classes by the number of students in each class:

4 classes * 21 students/class = 84 students

Each student is trying to plant 2 seeds in their pots. To find the total number of seeds needed, we multiply the total number of students by the number of seeds each student needs:

84 students * 2 seeds/student = 168 seeds

Therefore, they need a total of 168 seeds for all the 3rd graders to plant 2 seeds each.
Question: There are 96 stakes at 10-meter (m) intervals around the sheep pasture, and 82 stakes at 20-meter (m) intervals around the perimeter of the horse pasture. What is the difference between the perimeters of the two ranches in meters (m)?
Answer: To find the perimeters of the two pastures, we need to multiply the number of stakes by the interval distance between each stake for both the sheep and horse pastures.

For the sheep pasture:
Number of stakes = 96
Interval distance = 10 meters
Perimeter of sheep pasture = Number of stakes × Interval distance
Perimeter of sheep pasture = 96 stakes × 10 m/stake
Perimeter of sheep pasture = 960 meters

For the horse pasture:
Number of stakes = 82
Interval distance = 20 meters
Perimeter of horse pasture = Number of stakes × Interval distance
Perimeter of horse pasture = 82 stakes × 20 m/stake
Perimeter of horse pasture = 1640 meters

Now, to find the difference between the perimeters of the two pastures:
Difference = Perimeter of horse pasture - Perimeter of sheep pasture
Difference = 1640 m - 960 m
Difference = 680 meters

The difference between the perimeters of the two pastures is 680 meters.

Question: 282 is 133 greater than this number. What is the value if 11 is subtracted from this number?
Answer: Let's call the unknown number "x". According to the information given:

282 is 133 greater than x, so we can write the equation:
282 = x + 133

To find the value of x, we subtract 133 from both sides of the equation:
282 - 133 = x
149 = x

Now, we need to find the value if 11 is subtracted from x:
x - 11 = 149 - 11
x - 11 = 138

Therefore, the value is 138 when 11 is subtracted from the number x.
Question: The taxi driven by Boeun's father travels 100 kilometers (km) in 1 hour and 15 minutes. What is the average distance the taxi traveled in 1 hour in kilometers (km)?
Answer: To find the average distance the taxi traveled in 1 hour, we need to calculate the distance it would cover in that time based on the distance it covers in 1 hour and 15 minutes.

1 hour and 15 minutes is equal to 1 + (15/60) hours, which is 1.25 hours.

The taxi travels 100 km in 1.25 hours.

To find the distance traveled in 1 hour, we divide the total distance by the total time:

Distance in 1 hour = Total distance / Total time
Distance in 1 hour = 100 km / 1.25 hours
Distance in 1 hour = 80 km

So, the average distance the taxi traveled in 1 hour is 80 kilometers.
Question: There are 15 red apples, 8 green apples, and 32 pears. How many more pears are there than apples?
Answer: To find out how many more pears there are than apples, we first need to find the total number of apples. 

There are 15 red apples and 8 green apples, so the total number of apples is:

15 red apples + 8 green apples = 23 apples

Now, we compare this to the number of pears:

32 pears - 23 apples = 9 more pears than apples

So, there are 9 more pears than apples.

Question: There is a barrel with 10.4 kilograms (kg) of water. If you want to divide this water by 0.8 kg (kg) into each small bucket, how many buckets are needed?
Answer: To find out how many buckets are needed, you divide the total amount of water by the amount of water each bucket can hold.

Total amount of water = 10.4 kg
Amount of water per bucket = 0.8 kg

Number of buckets needed = Total amount of water / Amount of water per bucket
Number of buckets needed = 10.4 kg / 0.8 kg
Number of buckets needed = 13

So, you would need 13 buckets to divide 10.4 kg of water into 0.8 kg portions.
Question: Find the 6th largest number among four digits that can be formed by using 1, 3, 0, and 5 only once.
Answer: To find the 6th largest number using the digits 1, 3, 0, and 5, we first need to list all the possible four-digit numbers that can be formed using these digits without repetition. Since 0 cannot be the first digit of a four-digit number, we'll start with the non-zero digits.

Here are the possible four-digit numbers in descending order:

1. 5310

Question: The average height of the three people, A, B, and C is 143 centimeters (cm). If A's height is increased by 4.5 centimeters (cm), it becomes the average height of B and C. If B is 3 centimeters (cm) taller than C, how tall is C in centimeters (cm)?
Answer: Let's denote the heights of A, B, and C as \( h_A \), \( h_B \), and \( h_C \) respectively.

According to the information given:

1. The average height of A, B, and C is 143 cm:
\[ \frac{h_A + h_B + h_C}{3} = 143 \]
\[ h_A + h_B + h_C = 3 \times 143 \]
\[ h_A + h_B + h_C = 429 \] (Equation 1)

2. A's height increased by 4.5 cm becomes the average height of B and C:
\[ h_A + 4.5 = \frac{h_B + h_C}{2} \]
\[ 2h_A + 9 = h_B + h_C \] (Equation 2)

3. B is 3 cm taller than C:
\[ h_B = h_C + 3 \] (Equation 3)

Now, we can substitute \( h_B \) from Equation 3 into Equation 2:
\[ 2h_A + 9 = (h_C + 3) + h_C \]
\[ 2h_A + 9 = 2h_C + 3 \]
\[ 2h_A = 2h_C - 6 \]
\[ h_A = h_C - 3 \] (Equation 4)

Now, we can substitute \( h_A \) and \( h_B \) from Equations 4 and 3 into Equation 1:
\[ (h_C - 3) + (h_C + 3) + h_C = 429 \]
\[ 3h_C = 429 \]
\[ h_C = \frac{429}{3} \]
\[ h_C = 143 \]

Therefore, the height of C is 143 cm.
Question: Tigers are said to run 3.8 kilometers (km) per hour. How many kilometers (km) could the tiger run without stopping in 2 hours and 45 minutes?
Answer: To calculate the distance a tiger could run without stopping in 2 hours and 45 minutes, we first need to convert the time into hours since the speed is given in kilometers per hour (km/h).

2 hours and 45 minutes is equivalent to 2 hours + (45 minutes / 60 minutes per hour) = 2 + 0.75 hours = 2.75 hours.

Now, we can use the speed of the tiger to calculate the distance:

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 3.8 km/h × 2.75 hours

Distance = 10.45 km

So, the tiger could run 10.45 kilometers without stopping in 2 hours and 45 minutes.
Question: The weight of Jung-min's dog is 2 kilograms (kg) and 600 grams (g), and the weight of the cat is 3700 grams (g). Find the total weight in grams (g) of the animals that Jung-min raises.
Answer: First, we need to convert the weight of Jung-min's dog from kilograms and grams to grams. Since 1 kilogram is equal to 1000 grams, we can calculate the weight of the dog in grams as follows:

Weight of dog in kg: 2 kg
Weight of dog in g: 600 g

Convert kg to g: 2 kg * 1000 g/kg = 2000 g

Now, add the additional grams to the converted weight:
Total weight of dog in g: 2000 g + 600 g = 2600 g

Next, we have the weight of the cat, which is already given in grams:
Weight of cat in g: 3700 g

Now, we can find the total weight of both animals by adding their weights in grams:
Total weight of dog and cat in g: 2600 g + 3700 g = 6300 g

Therefore, the total weight in grams of the animals that Jung-min raises is 6300 grams.

Question: There are 3 blue balls and 5 red balls in the box. When 2 red balls are put in, how many red balls are there in the box?
Answer: Initially, there are 5 red balls in the box. When 2 more red balls are added, the total number of red balls becomes:

5 (initial red balls) + 2 (added red balls) = 7 red balls

So, there are now 7 red balls in the box.
Question: Jimin has 5 100-won coins and 1 50-won coin, and Seokjin has 2 100-won coins and 7 10-won coins. Find out the sum of the money they both have.
Answer: To find the sum of the money Jimin and Seokjin have, we need to calculate the total amount of money each of them has and then add those amounts together.

Jimin has:
- 5 100-won coins
- 1 50-won coin

Seokjin has:
- 2 100-won coins
- 7 10-won coins

Let's calculate the total for each person:

Jimin's total:
\( (5 \times 100) + (1 \times 50) = 500 + 50 = 550 \) won

Seokjin's total:
\( (2 \times 100) + (7 \times 10) = 200 + 70 = 270 \) won

Now, let's add the totals together to find the sum of the money they both have:

\( 550 + 270 = 820 \) won

So, the sum of the money Jimin and Seokjin have is 820 won.
Question: When 35 students including Minyoung are standing in a line, 27 students are standing in front of Minyeong. How many students are behind Minyoung?
Answer: If there are 27 students in front of Minyoung, and Minyoung is also in the line, then we need to count Minyoung as well. So, there are 27 students plus Minyoung in front of the line, which makes 28 people.

Now, we know there are 35 students in total. To find out how many students are behind Minyoung, we subtract the 28 people in front of the line (including Minyoung) from the total number of students:

35 (total students) - 28 (students in front of and including Minyoung) = 7 students

So, there are 7 students standing behind Minyoung.

Question: You bought 60 centimeters (cm) of wire from a stationery store to make a square with a side length of 9 centimeters (cm). If you use this wire to make a square, how many centimeters (cm) of wire will you have left?
Answer: To make a square, you need 4 equal lengths of wire, one for each side of the square.

If each side of the square is 9 cm, then the total length of wire needed to make the square is:

4 sides * 9 cm/side = 36 cm

You started with 60 cm of wire, so if you use 36 cm to make the square, you will have:

60 cm - 36 cm = 24 cm

You will have 24 cm of wire left after making the square.
Question: What number must go in B to make 38A-B1=364?
Answer: Let's solve the equation step by step.

Given: 38A - B1 = 364

First, we need to understand that A and B are single-digit numbers (from 0 to 9) because they are part of a two-digit number (38A and B1).

Let's assume A = x and B = y, where x and y are single-digit integers.

So, the equation becomes: 380 + x - 10y - 1 = 364

Simplify the equation: 380 + x - 10y = 365

Now, let's isolate x: x = 365 + 10y - 380

Further simplification: x = -15 + 10y

Since x must be a single-digit number, we need to find a value of y such that x is between 0 and 9.

Let's try different values of y (from 0 to 9) to see which one gives us a valid x:

For y = 0, x = -15 + 10(0) = -15 (not a valid single-digit number)
For y = 1, x = -15 + 10(1) = -5 (not a valid single-digit number)
For y = 2, x = -15 + 10(2) = 5 (valid single-digit number)

So, when y = 2 (B = 2), x = 5 (A = 5).

Therefore, the number that must go in B to make the equation true is 2, and the number for A is 5.

The equation becomes: 385 - 21 = 364, which is true.
Question: 169 is 108 greater than a certain number. What number is 125 greater than the certain number?
Answer: Let's call the certain number "x".

According to the information given, 169 is 108 greater than x. So we can write the equation:

169 = x + 108

Now, we want to find out what number is 125 greater than x. To find x, we first solve the equation above:

x = 169 - 108
x = 61

Now that we know x is 61, we can find the number that is 125 greater than x by adding 125 to x:

61 + 125 = 186

So, the number that is 125 greater than the certain number (x) is 186.

Question: Hajin wants to find the password of a lock. The password is set with one of the three numbers: 1, 7, 4, with the tens digit of 3. When password has all different numbers, find the sum of the largest and the third largest three-digit number that can be a password.
Answer: To find the password, we need to consider that it is a three-digit number with the tens digit fixed at 3 and the other two digits can be either 1, 7, or 4, with all digits being different.

Let's list out the possible combinations for the hundreds and units place, given that the tens place is already 3:

- 1 in the hundreds place and 7 in the units place: 137
- 1 in the hundreds place and 4 in the units place: 134
- 7 in the hundreds place and 1 in the units place: 731
- 7 in the hundreds place and 4 in the units place: 734
- 4 in the hundreds place and 1 in the units place: 431
- 4 in the hundreds place and 7 in the units place: 437

Now, let's sort these numbers to find the largest and the third largest:

1. 734 (largest)
2. 731
3. 437 (third largest)
4. 431
5. 137
6. 134

The sum of the largest (734) and the third largest (437) is:

734 + 437 = 1171

Therefore, the sum of the largest and the third largest three-digit number that can be a password is 1171.
Question: Jimin has 5 100-won coins and 1 50-won coin, and Seokjin has 2 100-won coins and 7 10-won coins. Find out the sum of the money they both have.
Answer: To find the sum of the money Jimin and Seokjin have, we need to calculate the total amount of money each of them has and then add those amounts together.

Jimin has:
- 5 100-won coins
- 1 50-won coin

Seokjin has:
- 2 100-won coins
- 7 10-won coins

Let's calculate the total for each person:

Jimin's total:
\( (5 \times 100) + (1 \times 50) = 500 + 50 = 550 \) won

Seokjin's total:
\( (2 \times 100) + (7 \times 10) = 200 + 70 = 270 \) won

Now, let's add the totals together to find the sum of the money they both have:

\( 550 + 270 = 820 \) won

So, the sum of the money Jimin and Seokjin have is 820 won.
Question: Yesterday, Eunji's uncle gave Eunji some pocket money. Eunji bought a notebook with half of her pocket money, and when she received an additional 550 won from her mother today, her money became 1,000 won. How much money did she get from her uncle?
Answer: Let's denote the amount of pocket money Eunji received from her uncle as X won.

According to the information given, Eunji spent half of her pocket money on a notebook. So, she spent X/2 won on the notebook.

After buying the notebook, she had X/2 won left.

Today, Eunji's mother gave her an additional 550 won. So, the money she had after receiving the additional amount is (X/2 + 550 won).

We are told that after receiving the additional 550 won, Eunji has a total of 1,000 won. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

X/2 + 550 won = 1,000 won

Now, let's solve for X:

X/2 = 1,000 won - 550 won
X/2 = 450 won

To find the total amount Eunji received from her uncle, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

X = 450 won * 2
X = 900 won

Therefore, Eunji received 900 won from her uncle.

Question: There is a cube with a side perimeter of 52 centimeters (cm). What is the surface area of this cube in square centimeters (cm2)?
Answer: The side perimeter of a cube refers to the perimeter of one of its faces, which is a square. Since a square has four equal sides, we can find the length of one side of the cube by dividing the side perimeter by 4.

Side perimeter of the cube = 52 cm
Length of one side of the cube (s) = Side perimeter / 4
s = 52 cm / 4
s = 13 cm

The surface area (SA) of a cube is calculated by multiplying the area of one face by 6 (since a cube has 6 faces).

Area of one face = s^2
Area of one face = (13 cm)^2
Area of one face = 169 cm^2

Surface area of the cube = 6 * Area of one face
SA = 6 * 169 cm^2
SA = 1014 cm^2

Therefore, the surface area of the cube is 1014 square centimeters (cm^2).

Question: Yeonju received 1/4 of the total number of notebooks, and Minji received 3/7. If there were 28 notebooks, how many notebooks are left?
Answer: First, let's find out how many notebooks Yeonju received. Since she got 1/4 of the total number of notebooks, we calculate:

1/4 * 28 = 7 notebooks

Now, let's find out how many notebooks Minji received. Since she got 3/7 of the total number of notebooks, we calculate:

3/7 * 28 = 12 notebooks

Now, let's add the number of notebooks Yeonju and Minji received to find out the total number of notebooks they got together:

7 (Yeonju) + 12 (Minji) = 19 notebooks

Finally, to find out how many notebooks are left, we subtract the total number of notebooks Yeonju and Minji received from the total number of notebooks:

28 (total notebooks) - 19 (notebooks received by Yeonju and Minji) = 9 notebooks

So, there are 9 notebooks left.

Question: How many kilograms (kg) are in 11 bricks if 5 bricks weigh 15.3 kilograms (kg)?
Answer: To find out how many kilograms are in 11 bricks, we first need to determine the weight of one brick. We can do this by dividing the total weight of the 5 bricks by the number of bricks:

15.3 kg / 5 bricks = 3.06 kg per brick

Now that we know the weight of one brick, we can calculate the weight of 11 bricks:

3.06 kg/brick * 11 bricks = 33.66 kg

Therefore, 11 bricks weigh 33.66 kilograms.
Question: I am trying to create a three-digit number using 0, 1, 3, and 5. If each number can be used only once, find out the sum of the smallest number and the largest possible number.
Answer: To create the smallest possible three-digit number using the digits 0, 1, 3, and 5, we need to ensure that the smallest non-zero digit is in the hundreds place, the next smallest in the tens place, and the next in the ones place. Since 0 cannot be in the hundreds place (as that would make it a two-digit number), we will use 1 as the smallest non-zero digit for the hundreds place. The next smallest digit is 0, which we will place in the tens place, and then 3 in the ones place. So, the smallest number we can create is 103.

To create the largest possible three-digit number, we need to place the largest digit in the hundreds place, the next largest in the tens place, and the smallest in the ones place. The largest digit we have is 5, so we'll place that in the hundreds place. The next largest is 3, which we'll place in the tens place, and then 1 in the ones place (since we cannot use 0 as it would not increase the value of the number). So, the largest number we can create is 531.

Now, we find the sum of the smallest and largest numbers:

Smallest number = 103
Largest number = 531

Sum = 103 + 531 = 634

Therefore, the sum of the smallest and largest possible numbers is 634.
Question: When it comes to mountain climbing, there are two routes. One is shorter and the other is 2 kilometers (km) longer. When I went up, I walked at 3 kilometers (km) per hour on a short path, and when I came down, I came down a long path at 4 kilometers (km) per hour. The hike took 4 hours in total. Find the time taken to come down.
Answer: Let's denote the length of the shorter path as \( x \) kilometers. Therefore, the longer path is \( x + 2 \) kilometers.

We know the speed going up the shorter path is 3 km/h and the speed coming down the longer path is 4 km/h.

The time taken to go up the shorter path is \( \frac{x}{3} \) hours, and the time taken to come down the longer path is \( \frac{x + 2}{4} \) hours.

According to the problem, the total time for the hike is 4 hours. So we can write the equation:

\[ \frac{x}{3} + \frac{x + 2}{4} = 4 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 12. We can rewrite the equation as:

\[ \frac{4x}{12} + \frac{3(x + 2)}{12} = 4 \]

Now, multiply both sides of the equation by 12 to get rid of the denominators:

\[ 4x + 3(x + 2) = 48 \]

Distribute the 3 into the parentheses:

\[ 4x + 3x + 6 = 48 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 7x + 6 = 48 \]

Subtract 6 from both sides:

\[ 7x = 42 \]

Divide both sides by 7:

\[ x = 6 \]

Now that we have the length of the shorter path, we can find the time taken to come down the longer path, which is \( x + 2 \) km:

\[ \text{Time to come down} = \frac{x + 2}{4} = \frac{6 + 2}{4} = \frac{8}{4} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time taken to come down the longer path is 2 hours.

Question: I made the mistake of adding this number to 63, when I should have divided 36 by this number. The result of this miscalculation was 69. How much is it if I calculate it right?
Answer: Let's call the number you should have divided by "x".

According to your statement, you added x to 63 instead of dividing 36 by x, and the result was 69.

So the equation for the miscalculation is:
63 + x = 69

Now, solve for x:
x = 69 - 63
x = 6

Now that we know x is 6, we can calculate the correct operation, which is dividing 36 by 6:
36 ÷ 6 = 6

So the correct result is 6.
Question: The sum of the weight of 9 comic books and 7 children's books was 10.98 kilograms (kg). If a comic book weighs 0.8 kilograms (kg), how many kilograms (kg) does a children's book weigh?
Answer: Let's denote the weight of a children's book as \( C \) kilograms.

We know that 9 comic books weigh \( 9 \times 0.8 \) kg, which is \( 7.2 \) kg.

The total weight of the comic books and the children's books together is \( 10.98 \) kg.

So, the weight of the 7 children's books is the total weight minus the weight of the comic books:

\( 10.98 \) kg (total) - \( 7.2 \) kg (comic books) = \( 3.78 \) kg (children's books).

Since this is the weight of 7 children's books, we can find the weight of one children's book by dividing by 7:

\( C = \frac{3.78 \text{ kg}}{7} \).

\( C = 0.54 \) kg.

Therefore, each children's book weighs \( 0.54 \) kilograms.
Question: The number of students in Seungju's class is between 50 and 70. If the students in Seungju's class form 5 lines, there will be 3 left, and if they form 7 lines, 2 will remain. How many students are in Seungju's class?
Answer: Let's denote the number of students in Seungju's class as \( n \).

According to the problem, when the students form 5 lines, there are 3 left over. This means that \( n \) can be expressed as \( 5k + 3 \) for some integer \( k \). In other words, \( n \) is 3 more than a multiple of 5.

Similarly, when the students form 7 lines, there are 2 left over. This means that \( n \) can also be expressed as \( 7m + 2 \) for some integer \( m \). In other words, \( n \) is 2 more than a multiple of 7.

We are also given that \( 50 < n < 70 \).

Now, we need to find a number that satisfies both conditions and falls within the given range. We can do this by listing the numbers that are 3 more than multiples of 5 within the range, and then checking which of those are also 2 more than multiples of 7.

Multiples of 5 in the range from 50 to 70 are: 50, 55, 60, 65, 70.
Adding 3 to each of these gives us: 53, 58, 63, 68, 73.

Now, we check which of these are 2 more than a multiple of 7:
- 53 is not a multiple of 7 plus 2.
- 58 is not a multiple of 7 plus 2.
- 63 is a multiple of 7 (7 * 9), but 63 + 2 = 65, not 63.
- 68 is not a multiple of 7 plus 2.
- 73 is not within our range.

However, we missed one multiple of 5 within the range, which is 55. Adding 3 to 55 gives us 58, which we already determined is not a multiple of 7 plus 2.

Let's try another approach and list the numbers that are 2 more than multiples of 7 within the range:
Multiples of 7 in the range from 50 to 70 are: 49, 56, 63.
Adding 2 to each of these gives us: 51, 58, 65.

Now, we check which of these are also 3 more than a multiple of 5:
- 51 is not a multiple of 5 plus 3.
- 58 is a multiple of 5 (5 * 11) plus 3.
- 65 is a multiple of 5 (5 * 13) plus 3.

Both 58 and 65 are 3 more than a multiple of 5 and 2 more than a multiple of 7, but only 58 falls within the range of 50 to 70.

Therefore, the number of students in Seungju's class is 58.

Question: (A) car travels at 60 kilometers (km) per hour and (B) car travels at 45 kilometers (km) per hour. If 5 hours have passed since starting from the same starting point, how many kilometers (km) is (A) car ahead of (B) car?
Answer: To find out how many kilometers car A is ahead of car B, we need to calculate the distance each car has traveled and then find the difference between those distances.

Distance is calculated by multiplying speed by time.

For car A:
Speed = 60 km/h
Time = 5 hours
Distance = Speed × Time = 60 km/h × 5 h = 300 km

For car B:
Speed = 45 km/h
Time = 5 hours
Distance = Speed × Time = 45 km/h × 5 h = 225 km

Now, we find the difference between the distances:
Distance A - Distance B = 300 km - 225 km = 75 km

Car A is 75 kilometers ahead of car B after 5 hours.
Question: What is the sum of all numbers less than 0.4 among 0.8, 1/2, and 0.9?
Answer: To find the sum of all numbers less than 0.4 among 0.8, 1/2, and 0.9, we first need to compare each number to 0.4.

0.8 is greater than 0.4.
1/2 (which is 0.5) is greater than 0.4.
0.9 is greater than 0.4.

None of these numbers are less than 0.4, so the sum of all numbers less than 0.4 among these three numbers is 0.
Question: If you have three numbers of 10, 11 and 12, what do you get for the difference between the largest number and the second largest number?
Answer: The largest number is 12 and the second largest number is 11. The difference between them is:

12 - 11 = 1

So, the difference between the largest number and the second largest number is 1.
Question: A is 348 and A is less than B by 173. C is greater than B by 299. Find C.

3. C is greater than B by 299, so C is 521 + 299 = 820.

So, C is

Question: If there are 3 bus routes and 2 subway routes going from Seohee's house to school, find the number of ways to go by bus or subway.
Answer: To find the total number of ways Seohee can go to school by bus or subway, we simply add the number of bus routes to the number of subway routes.

Number of bus routes = 3
Number of subway routes = 2

Total number of ways = Number of bus routes + Number of subway routes
Total number of ways = 3 + 2
Total number of ways = 5

So, there are 5 different ways Seohee can go to school by bus or subway.
Question: 20 students stood in a line. Jungkook stands third in line, and Yoongi stands behind Jungkook. If there are 5 students between Yoongi and Jungkook, how many students are standing behind Yoongi?
Answer: If Jungkook stands third in line and there are 5 students between him and Yoongi, then Yoongi is standing in the 3rd position + 5 students + 1 (for Yoongi himself) = 9th position in line.

Since there are 20 students in total and Yoongi is the 9th, to find out how many students are standing behind Yoongi, we subtract the 9 students in front of him from the total number of students:

20 students (total) - 9 students (in front of Yoongi) = 11 students standing behind Yoongi.
Question: If there are 8 boxes of 12 soccer balls and 5 boxes of 12 basketballs, how many basketballs are fewer than soccer balls?
Answer: First, let's calculate the total number of soccer balls and basketballs.

For soccer balls:
8 boxes * 12 soccer balls per box = 96 soccer balls

For basketballs:
5 boxes * 12 basketballs per box = 60 basketballs

Now, let's find out how many fewer basketballs there are compared to soccer balls:

96 soccer balls - 60 basketballs = 36 fewer basketballs

So, there are 36 fewer basketballs than soccer balls.
Question: A is 3 groups of 10 and 7 individual units, and B is the number obtained by subtracting 1 from 40. Which is smaller, A or B?

Question: There are 5 different people. We are trying to select three of them to be the president, vice president, and manager. Find the number of cases.
Answer: To find the number of cases for selecting a president, vice president, and manager from 5 different people, we can use permutations since the order of selection matters (the roles are distinct).

The number of permutations of n distinct objects taken r at a time is given by the formula:

nPr = n! / (n - r)!

In this case, we have n = 5 (the number of people) and r = 3 (the number of positions to fill).

So, the number of cases is:

5P3 = 5! / (5 - 3)!
= 5! / 2!
= (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / (2 × 1)
= (5 × 4 × 3)
= 60

Therefore, there are 60 different cases for selecting a president, vice president, and manager from 5 different people.
Question: What is the fifth largest number that can come out when you divide a number by 85?
Answer: To find the fifth largest number that can come out when you divide a number by 85, we need to consider the possible results of such division. Since we are looking for the fifth largest, we can start from the largest possible result and count down.

The largest number that can come out when you divide a number by 85 is when you divide 85 itself, which would give you a result of 1. This is because any number divided by itself equals 1, and any number smaller than 85 divided by 85 would result in a fraction less than 1.

So, counting down from the largest possible result:

1st largest: 85 / 85 = 1
2nd largest: 84 / 85 = 0.9882... (but we are likely looking for whole numbers)
3rd largest: 83 / 85 = 0.9764... (again, not a whole number)
4th largest: 82 / 85 = 0.9647... (still not a whole number)
5th largest: 81 / 85 = 0.9529... (not a whole number)

However, if we are looking for whole numbers, we need to consider the remainders. When you divide a whole number by 85, the largest remainder you can get is 84 (since 85 would mean the number is divisible by 85). So, we can consider the fifth largest remainder instead:

1st largest remainder: 84 (when dividing 84 by 85)
2nd largest remainder: 83 (when dividing 83 by 85)
3rd largest remainder: 82 (when dividing 82 by 85)
4th largest remainder: 81 (when dividing 81 by 85)
5th largest remainder: 80 (when dividing 80 by 85)

So, the fifth largest number (in terms of remainders) that can come out when you divide a number by 85 is 80, which is the remainder when you divide 80 by 85. The quotient in this case would be 0, with a remainder of 80.
Question: There are three natural numbers A, B, and C. When A is divided by 7, the quotient is B and the remainder is C. The quotient and remainder are equal in this equation. Find the largest number among A.
Answer: Let's denote A as the natural number, B as the quotient, and C as the remainder when A is divided by 7. According to the problem, B = C.

From the division algorithm, we know that:
A = 7B + C

Since B = C, we can substitute C for B:
A = 7C + C
A = 8C

Now, since B and C are equal and they are natural numbers, the largest value for C when divided by 7 would be 6, because if C were 7 or greater, it would not be a remainder (as 7 is divisible by 7 with no remainder).

So, let's substitute C with 6:
A = 8 * 6
A = 48

Therefore, the largest number A, given the conditions, is 48.

Question: A regular polygon with a perimeter of 80 centimeters (cm) has a side length of 16 centimeters (cm). How many vertices are there in this regular polygon?
Answer: To find the number of vertices in a regular polygon, we can divide the perimeter by the length of one side.

Given that the perimeter is 80 cm and the side length is 16 cm, we can calculate the number of sides (and thus the number of vertices, since they are the same in a regular polygon) as follows:

Number of sides (vertices) = Perimeter / Side length
Number of sides (vertices) = 80 cm / 16 cm
Number of sides (vertices) = 5

Therefore, the regular polygon has 5 vertices.
Question: There are ribbons with lengths of 36 centimeters (cm), 42 centimeters (cm), and 48 centimeters (cm), respectively. I cut 1/6 of this ribbons and tied the remaining pieces together to make one long ribbon. The length of the ribbon made is 97 centimeters (cm). Find how many centimeters (cm) are used to tie the ribbons together.
Answer: First, let's find out how much of each ribbon was cut off:

For the 36 cm ribbon, 1/6 of it is cut off:
36 cm * (1/6) = 6 cm

For the 42 cm ribbon, 1/6 of it is cut off:
42 cm * (1/6) = 7 cm

For the 48 cm ribbon, 1/6 of it is cut off:
48 cm * (1/6) = 8 cm

Now, let's find out the remaining length of each ribbon after cutting:

For the 36 cm ribbon:
36 cm - 6 cm = 30 cm

For the 42 cm ribbon:
42 cm - 7 cm = 35 cm

For the 48 cm ribbon:
48 cm - 8 cm = 40 cm

Next, let's add up the remaining lengths of the ribbons to find the total length before tying them together:

30 cm + 35 cm + 40 cm = 105 cm

The total length of the ribbon made after tying them together is given as 97 cm. This means that the length used to tie the ribbons together is the difference between the total length before tying and the length after tying:

105 cm - 97 cm = 8 cm

Therefore, 8 centimeters (cm) are used to tie the ribbons together.
Question: Three out of five digits 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 were chosen to make a three-digit odd number. If you can use the same number multiple times, what is the total of all the odd numbers that can be made?
Answer: To create a three-digit odd number, the last digit must be odd. From the given digits 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, the odd digits are 1 and 3. So, the last digit of the number can be either 1 or 3.

The first digit can be any of the non-zero digits (1, 2, 3, 4) since a number cannot start with 0. The middle digit can be any of the five digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4).

Let's calculate the total of all such odd numbers.

For the last digit being 1:
- There are 4 choices for the first digit (1, 2, 3, 4).
- There are 5 choices for the middle digit (0, 1, 2, 3, 4).
- So, there are 4 * 5 = 20 combinations for the first two digits.
- Each of these combinations will end with a 1, so the total for the last digit being 1 is 20 * 1 = 20.

For the last digit being 3:
- There are 4 choices for the first digit (1, 2, 3, 4).
- There are 5 choices for the middle digit (0, 1, 2, 3, 4).
- So, there are 4 * 5 = 20 combinations for the first two digits.
- Each of these combinations will end with a 3, so the total for the last digit being 3 is 20 * 3 = 60.

Now, let's calculate the total sum of all these numbers. We'll calculate the sum for each position (hundreds, tens, and ones) separately and then add them up.

For the hundreds place:
- Each of the digits 1, 2, 3, 4 will appear in the hundreds place 10 times (5 times for each of the two possible last digits).
- So, the total for the hundreds place is (1+2+3+4) * 10 = 10 * 10 = 100.

For the tens place:
- Each of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 will appear in the tens place 8 times (4 times for each of the two possible last digits).
- So, the total for the tens place is (0+1+2+3+4) * 8 = 10 * 8 = 80.

For the ones place:
- We already calculated the total for the ones place: 20 (for last digit 1) + 60 (for last digit 3) = 80.

Now, let's add up the totals for each place:
- Hundreds place total: 100 * 100 = 10,000
- Tens place total: 80 * 10 = 800
- Ones place total: 80 * 1 = 80

The grand total of all the odd numbers that can be made is:
10,000 + 800 + 80 = 10,880

So, the total of all the odd numbers that can be made is 10,880.

Question: There are three bottles, A, B, and C, each with different sizes. 7 bottles of A and 3 bottles of B have the same capacity, and 1 bottle of B and 5 bottles of C are the same. How many bottles of C are equal to 21 bottles of A?
Answer: Let's denote the capacity of bottle A as \( a \), bottle B as \( b \), and bottle C as \( c \).

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. \( 7a = 3b \) (7 bottles of A have the same capacity as 3 bottles of B)
2. \( b = 5c \) (1 bottle of B has the same capacity as 5 bottles of C)

We want to find out how many bottles of C are equal to 21 bottles of A.

First, let's express \( b \) in terms of \( a \) using the first equation:

\[ 7a = 3b \]
\[ b = \frac{7a}{3} \]

Now, let's substitute \( b \) in the second equation with \( \frac{7a}{3} \):

\[ b = 5c \]
\[ \frac{7a}{3} = 5c \]

Now, we want to find the equivalent number of bottles of C for 21 bottles of A. Let's express 21 bottles of A in terms of \( c \):

\[ 21a = x \cdot c \]

We need to find \( x \), the number of bottles of C that are equivalent to 21 bottles of A. To do this, we can use the relationship we found between \( a \) and \( c \):

\[ \frac{7a}{3} = 5c \]
\[ a = \frac{15c}{7} \]

Now, substitute \( a \) in the equation for 21 bottles of A:

\[ 21 \cdot \frac{15c}{7} = x \cdot c \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 3 \cdot 15c = x \cdot c \]
\[ 45c = x \cdot c \]

Now, divide both sides by \( c \) to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 45 \]

Therefore, 21 bottles of A are equal to 45 bottles of C.
Question: The area of a square with a side of 5 centimeters (cm) is equal to the area of a rectangle with a side of 4 centimeters (cm). Find the length of the other side of the rectangle as a decimal number.
Answer: To find the area of the square, we use the formula for the area of a square, which is side length squared:

Area of square = side length × side length
Area of square = 5 cm × 5 cm
Area of square = 25 cm²

Since the area of the rectangle is equal to the area of the square, the area of the rectangle is also 25 cm².

The formula for the area of a rectangle is:

Area of rectangle = length × width

We know the width of the rectangle is 4 cm, and we are looking for the length (let's call it L). So we can set up the equation:

25 cm² = L × 4 cm

To find the length L, we divide both sides of the equation by 4 cm:

L = 25 cm² / 4 cm
L = 6.25 cm

Therefore, the length of the other side of the rectangle is 6.25 cm.
Question: You made a mistake in multiplying 36 by a number, so I added a number to 63 instead. Suppose that you got 70. How much is it if you calculate it correctly?
Answer: If you added a number to 63 and got 70, then the number you added is:

70 - 63 = 7

Now, if you were supposed to multiply 36 by that number instead of adding it to 63, the correct calculation would be:

36 * 7 = 252

So, if you calculate it correctly, the result is 252.

Question: Subtracting 46 from a number gives 15 as a result. What would be the result if 29 is subtracted from this number?
Answer: Let's call the unknown number "x".

According to the first statement, subtracting 46 from x gives 15:
x - 46 = 15

To find the value of x, we add 46 to both sides of the equation:
x - 46 + 46 = 15 + 46
x = 61

Now, we want to know the result if 29 is subtracted from this number (x = 61):
61 - 29 = 32

So, the result would be 32.

Answer: To find the natural numbers with a remainder of 2 when divided by 5, we look for numbers that are of the form 5n + 2, where n is a non-negative integer.

Starting from the largest number less than 100 that satisfies this condition, we have:

98 = 5 * 19 + 3 (remainder is not 2)
97 = 5 * 19 + 2 (remainder is 2, so this is the largest number with a remainder of 2)
96 = 5 * 19 + 1 (remainder is not 2)
95 = 5 * 19 (remainder is 0)
94 = 5 * 18 + 4 (remainder is not 2)
93 = 5 * 18 + 3 (remainder is not 2)
92 = 5 * 18 + 2 (remainder is 2, so this is the second largest number with a remainder of 2)
91 = 5 * 18 + 1 (remainder is not 2)
90 = 5 * 18 (remainder is 0)
89 = 5 * 17 + 4 (remainder is not 2)
88 = 5 * 17 + 3 (remainder is not 2)
87 = 5 * 17 + 2 (remainder is 2, so this is the third largest number with a remainder of 2)

Therefore, the third largest number with a remainder of 2 when divided by 5 among the natural numbers from 1 to 100 is 87.
Question: A number divided by 2 and dividing it by 2 again equals 85 plus 45. What is the value of subtracting 45 from the number?
Answer: Let's call the number we're looking for "x".

According to the problem, if we divide x by 2 and then divide the result by 2 again, we get 85 plus 45. So we can write the equation:

(x / 2) / 2 = 85 + 45

First, let's simplify the right side of the equation:

85 + 45 = 130

Now our equation looks like this:

(x / 2) / 2 = 130

To solve for x, we need to undo the division by 2 twice. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2, twice:

(x / 2) * 2 = 130 * 2
x = 260 * 2
x = 520

Now we have the value of x, which is 520. The problem asks for the value of subtracting 45 from the number, so we simply subtract 45 from x:

520 - 45 = 475

Therefore, the value of subtracting 45 from the number is 475.
Question: When 13 is divided by A, the quotient is B and the remainder is 3. A and B are both natural numbers. What is the largest number among possible A's?
Answer: Let's denote A as the divisor and B as the quotient when 13 is divided by A. We are given that the remainder is 3. According to the division algorithm, we can express this as:

13 = A * B + 3

Since A and B are natural numbers (positive integers), we need to find the largest possible value for A that satisfies this equation. To maximize A, we need to minimize B because as B gets smaller, A can get larger.

The smallest possible value for B is 1 because B cannot be 0 (as 0 would not be a natural number). So, let's substitute B = 1 into the equation:

13 = A * 1 + 3
13 = A + 3
A = 13 - 3
A = 10

Therefore, the largest possible value for A is 10 when B is 1.

Question: Multiplying a number by 13 and subtracting 272 gives you 105. Find the number.
Answer: Let's call the number you're looking for "x". According to the problem, if you multiply this number by 13 and then subtract 272, you get 105. We can write this as an equation:

13x - 272 = 105

To find the number, we need to solve for x. First, we'll add 272 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with x on one side:

13x - 272 + 272 = 105 + 272
13x = 377

Now, we'll divide both sides by 13 to solve for x:

13x / 13 = 377 / 13
x = 29

So the number you're looking for is 29.
Question: In the math test, Jimin ranked 24th, and Seokjin ranked 19 ranks ahead of Jimin. What is Seokjin's rank?
Answer: If Seokjin ranked 19 ranks ahead of Jimin, and Jimin ranked 24th, then we subtract 19 from 24 to find Seokjin's rank.

24 - 19 = 5

So, Seokjin's rank is 5th.
Question: How many full buckets are there when 135.1 liters (L) of water is divided into 7 liters (L) buckets?
Answer: To find out how many full 7-liter buckets can be filled with 135.1 liters of water, you divide the total amount of water by the capacity of each bucket.

135.1 liters ÷ 7 liters/bucket = 19.3 buckets

Since you can't have a fraction of a full bucket, you would have 19 full 7-liter buckets. The remaining 0.3 of a bucket would not be enough to fill another full 7-liter bucket.

Question: There are five numbers 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. What is the sum of the second largest number and the second smallest number?
Answer: The five numbers are 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

The second largest number is 13.
The second smallest number is 11.

The sum of the second largest number and the second smallest number is 13 + 11 = 24.
Question: Find the number of all diagonals in a heptagon.
Answer: A heptagon has 7 sides. To find the number of diagonals in a polygon, you can use the formula:

Number of diagonals = n(n - 3) / 2

where n is the number of sides in the polygon.

For a heptagon, n = 7. So, the number of diagonals is:

Number of diagonals = 7(7 - 3) / 2
Number of diagonals = 7(4) / 2
Number of diagonals = 28 / 2
Number of diagonals = 14

Therefore, a heptagon has 14 diagonals.
Question: Eunji is 25 years younger than her uncle and Yuna is 3 years older than Eunji. If her uncle is 41 years old, what is the sum of Eunji's and Yuna's ages?
Answer: If Eunji's uncle is 41 years old and Eunji is 25 years younger than her uncle, then Eunji's age is:

41 years (uncle's age) - 25 years = 16 years (Eunji's age)

Now, Yuna is 3 years older than Eunji, so Yuna's age is:

16 years (Eunji's age) + 3 years = 19 years (Yuna's age)

To find the sum of Eunji's and Yuna's ages, we add their ages together:

16 years (Eunji's age) + 19 years (Yuna's age) = 35 years

Therefore, the sum of Eunji's and Yuna's ages is 35 years.
Question: You have a rectangle with a perimeter of 40 centimeters (cm). If the width of this rectangle is 8 centimeters (cm), how many centimeters (cm) is the length?
Answer: 40 cm is the perimeter of the rectangle. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

Perimeter = 2(Width + Length)

The width of the rectangle is 8 cm, so we can substitute this value into the formula:

40 cm = 2(8 +

Question: You made a mistake in multiplying 36 by a number, so I added a number to 63 instead. Suppose that you got 70. How much is it if you calculate it correctly?
Answer: If you added a number to 63 and got 70, then the number you added is:

70 - 63 = 7

Now, if you were supposed to multiply 36 by that number instead of adding it to 63, the correct calculation would be:

36 * 7 = 252

So, if you calculate it correctly, the result is 252.
Question: How many two-digit numbers can you make from 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 using two different numbers?
Answer: To form a two-digit number using two different numbers from the set {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}, we can use the following approach:

1. Choose the first digit: There are 5 options for the first digit (4, 5, 6, 7, or 8).
2. Choose the second digit: After choosing the first digit, there are 4 remaining options for the second digit, since it must be different from the first.

Therefore, the total number of two-digit numbers that can be formed is the product of the number of options for the first digit and the number of options for the second digit:

5 (options for the first digit) × 4 (options for the second digit) = 20 two-digit numbers.
Question: What is the perimeter in centimeters (cm) of an octagon with all sides equal to 12 centimeters (cm)?
Answer: The perimeter of any polygon is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. Since an octagon has eight sides, and all sides of this octagon are equal to 12 centimeters, the perimeter P can be calculated as:

P = 8 * side length
P = 8 * 12 cm
P = 96 cm

So, the perimeter of the octagon is 96 centimeters.

Question: There are a total of 24 students in Year 1 and Year 2. Of these, 50 chocolates were distributed equally to only the first-year students, and two chocolates were left. If the number of second-year students is twice the number of first-year students, how many chocolates did the first-year students get?
Answer: Let's denote the number of first-year students as F and the number of second-year students as S.

According to the problem, the number of second-year students is twice the number of first-year students, so we can write this as:
S = 2F

We also know that there are a total of 24 students in Year 1 and Year 2 combined, so we can write this as:
F + S = 24

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
F + 2F = 24
3F = 24
F = 24 / 3
F = 8

So there are 8 first-year students.

Now, we know that 50 chocolates were distributed equally among the first-year students, and two were left. This means that the number of chocolates that can be distributed equally among the first-year students is 50 - 2 = 48 chocolates.

Since there are 8 first-year students, we can divide the 48 chocolates equally among them:
48 chocolates / 8 students = 6 chocolates per first-year student

Therefore, each first-year student got 6 chocolates.
Question: There are magic bags. The length becomes 10 times longer when a thing gets in and out of the red bag, and the length becomes 1/100 of the original length when a thing gets through the blue bag. Yeonwoo had 13.5 centimeters (cm) of sorghum straw put in and out of the red bag 3 times and the blue bag 2 times. How many centimeters (cm) is Yeonwoo's sorghum straw now?
Answer: Let's calculate the length of the sorghum straw after each step:

1. After the first time through the red bag, the length becomes 10 times longer:
   13.5 cm * 10 = 135 cm

2. After the second time through the red bag, the length becomes 10 times longer again:
   135 cm * 10 = 1350 cm

3. After the third time through the red bag, the length becomes 10 times longer once more:
   1350 cm * 10 = 13500 cm

4. After the first time through the blue bag, the length becomes 1/100 of the original length:
   13500 cm / 100 = 135 cm

5. After the second time through the blue bag, the length becomes 1/100 of the length again:
   135 cm / 100 = 1.35 cm

So, after going through the red bag 3 times and the blue bag 2 times, Yeonwoo's sorghum straw is now 1.35 centimeters long.
Question: The TV license fee is 30 won per 10 seconds. If Mingyu watched TV for 2 minutes and 40 seconds, how much would the license fee be?
Answer: First, we need to convert the time Mingyu watched TV into seconds. 

2 minutes and 40 seconds is equal to (2 * 60) + 40 seconds, which is 120 + 40 seconds, totaling 160 seconds.

Now, we know the TV license fee is 30 won per 10 seconds. To find out how many 10-second intervals are in 160 seconds, we divide 160 by 10, which gives us 16 intervals.

Finally, we multiply the number of intervals by the fee per interval to find the total cost:

16 intervals * 30 won per interval = 480 won

So, the license fee for watching TV for 2 minutes and 40 seconds would be 480 won.

Question: I stacked 10 rows of chips. 9 rows are stacked 8 each, and the other 1 row is stacked 4 each. How many chips are there in total?
Answer: To find the total number of chips, you can multiply the number of rows with the number of chips in each row and then add the row with a different number of chips.

For the 9 rows with 8 chips each:
9 rows * 8 chips/row = 72 chips

For the 1 row with 4 chips:
1 row * 4 chips/row = 4 chips

Now, add the two amounts together:
72 chips + 4 chips = 76 chips

So, there are a total of 76 chips.
Question: The average liter (L) of water and milk is 94 liters (L). If there is 100 liters of coffee, what is the average liter of water, milk and coffee?
Answer: To find the average of the three liquids (water, milk, and coffee), we need to add the total liters of each and then divide by the number of types of liquids.

We are given:
- The average of water and milk is 94 liters.
- There are 100 liters of coffee.

First, we need to find the total liters of water and milk combined. Since the average of water and milk is 94 liters, we can assume that the total liters of water and milk is 94 liters * 2 types of liquids = 188 liters.

Now, we add the liters of coffee to the total liters of water and milk:
188 liters (water and milk) + 100 liters (coffee) = 288 liters (total)

Finally, we divide the total liters by the number of types of liquids to find the new average:
288 liters (total) / 3 types of liquids (water, milk, coffee) = 96 liters

So, the average liter of water, milk, and coffee is 96 liters.
Question: You want to create a three-digit number by selecting three numbers from 0, 2, 4, and 6. If only the number can be used once, find the product of the largest possible number and the smallest possible number.
Answer: To create the largest possible three-digit number using the digits 0, 2, 4, and 6, we should place the largest digits at the most significant places. Therefore, the largest number would be 642.

To create the smallest possible three-digit number using the digits 0, 2, 4, and 6, we should place the smallest non-zero digit at the most significant place, because we cannot use 0 as the first digit of a three-digit number. Therefore, the smallest number would be 204.

Now, we find the product of the largest and smallest numbers:

642 * 204 = 130968

So, the product of the largest possible number and the smallest possible number is 130968.

Question: In art class, Miyoung is going to cut a rectangular colored paper measuring 32 centimeters (cm) wide by 74 centimeters (cm) long to make several identical squares without any left over. What is the size of one side of the largest square that Miyoung can make?
Answer: To find the size of the largest square Miyoung can make from the rectangular paper without any leftover, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two sides of the rectangle. The GCD will give us the largest length that can evenly divide both the width and the length of the rectangle.

The width of the paper is 32 cm, and the length is 74 cm. Let's find the GCD of 32 and 74.

We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD:

1. Divide the larger number by the smaller number and find the remainder.
2. Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder from step 1.
3. Repeat the process until the remainder is 0. The non-zero remainder just before this is the GCD.

Let's apply this to our numbers:

74 ÷ 32 = 2 with a remainder of 10.
32 ÷ 10 = 3 with a remainder of 2.
10 ÷ 2 = 5 with a remainder of 0.

So, the GCD of 32 and 74 is 2 cm.

Therefore, the largest square Miyoung can make from the rectangular paper without any leftover will have sides of 2 cm each.
Question: How many four-digit numbers are there if they can be divided by 5, 6, and 2 without any remainder?
Answer: To find the four-digit numbers that can be divided by 5, 6, and 2 without any remainder, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers and then determine how many multiples of this LCM fall within the range of four-digit numbers (1000 to 9999).

First, let's find the LCM of 5, 6, and 2.

The prime factorization of these numbers is:
- 5 is a prime number, so its prime factorization is 5.
- 6 can be factored into 2 * 3.
- 2 is a prime number, so its prime factorization is 2.

Since 6 already includes the factor 2, we don't need to consider the separate factor of 2 again. The LCM will be the product of the highest powers of all prime factors present in the numbers. In this case, we have:

LCM = 5 * 2 * 3 = 30

Now, we need to find the four-digit multiples of 30. The smallest four-digit number is 1000, and the largest is 9999.

To find the smallest four-digit multiple of 30, we divide 1000 by 30 and round up to the nearest whole number:

1000 ÷ 30 = 33.33...

The smallest multiple of 30 that is a four-digit number is 34 * 30 = 1020.

To find the largest four-digit multiple of 30, we divide 9999 by 30 and round down to the nearest whole number:

9999 ÷ 30 = 333.3...

The largest multiple of 30 that is a four-digit number is 333 * 30 = 9990.

Now, we need to count how many multiples of 30 there are between 1020 and 9990, inclusive.

(9990 - 1020) ÷ 30 + 1 = 8970 ÷ 30 + 1 = 299 + 1 = 300

There are 300 four-digit numbers that can be divided by 5, 6, and 2 without any remainder.
Question: If there are 6 cats A, B, C, D, E, and F, find the number of ways to select 2 vice captains and 1 captain.
Answer: To select 2 vice captains and 1 captain from 6 cats, we can approach the problem in two steps:

Step 1: Select the captain.
There are 6 cats to choose from for the captain position. So, there are 6 ways to select the captain.

Step 2: Select the 2 vice captains.
After selecting the captain, we are left with 5 cats to choose from for the vice captain positions. We need to select 2 vice captains from these 5 cats. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula:

C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)

Where n is the total number of items to choose from, k is the number of items to choose, and "!" denotes factorial.

In this case, n = 5 (remaining cats) and k = 2 (vice captains to select).

C(5, 2) = 5! / (2! * (5 - 2)!)
C(5, 2) = 5! / (2! * 3!)
C(5, 2) = (5 * 4 * 3!) / (2 * 1 * 3!)
C(5, 2) = (5 * 4) / (2 * 1)
C(5, 2) = 20 / 2
C(5, 2) = 10

So, there are 10 ways to select 2 vice captains from the remaining 5 cats.

Finally, to find the total number of ways to select 2 vice captains and 1 captain, we multiply the number of ways to select the captain by the number of ways to select the vice captains:

Total ways = Ways to select captain * Ways to select vice captains
Total ways = 6 * 10
Total ways = 60

Therefore, there are 60 different ways to select 2 vice captains and 1 captain from the 6 cats.

Question: There are two natural numbers A and B. When A is divided by B, the quotient is 28 and the remainder is 4. Find A when A is the smallest in this equation.
Answer: Let's denote A as the dividend and B as the divisor. According to the division algorithm, when a number A is divided by another number B, it can be expressed as:

A = B * Q + R

where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder.

From the given information, we have:
Q = 28 (the quotient when A is divided by B)
R = 4 (the remainder when A is divided by B)

We want to find the smallest possible value of A that satisfies this equation. Since we are looking for the smallest A, we should consider the smallest possible value of B that still gives a remainder of 4 when A is divided by it. The smallest B can be is 1 (since B is a natural number and natural numbers start from 1), but that would not give us a remainder of 4. The next smallest B would be 5, which would give us a remainder of 4 when A is divided by it (since 5 - 1 = 4).

So, let's try B = 5 and see if it satisfies the equation:

A = B * Q + R
A = 5 * 28 + 4
A = 140 + 4
A = 144

Therefore, the smallest possible value of A that satisfies the given conditions is 144.

Question: Hancho used 1/5 of the colored tape he had to make a work of art and gave 3/4 of the remaining to Gayeong. If the remaining length of the colored tape was 1 meter (m) and 50 centimeters (cm), how many meters (m) was the length of the colored tape that Hancho had at the beginning?
Answer: Let's denote the original length of the colored tape that Hancho had as \( x \) meters.

Hancho used \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the tape, so he had \( \frac{4}{5} \) of the tape left.

Then, he gave \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the remaining tape to Gayeong, which means he was left with \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the \( \frac{4}{5} \) of the original tape.

The remaining tape, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the \( \frac{4}{5} \) of the original tape, is given as 1 meter and 50 centimeters, which is 1.5 meters.

So, we have:

\( \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{4}{5} \times x = 1.5 \)

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\( \frac{1}{5} \times x = 1.5 \)

Now, to find \( x \), we multiply both sides by 5:

\( x = 1.5 \times 5 \)

\( x = 7.5 \)

Therefore, the original length of the colored tape that Hancho had was 7.5 meters.

Question: Jinwoo and Seongmin can do 7/12 of the work if they do something for 8 days together. The two of them did this together for 8 days, and the rest was done by Jinwoo alone for 10 days. How many days will it take if Seongmin finishes this task by himself from the beginning?
Answer: Let's denote the total work by W.

According to the information given, Jinwoo and Seongmin together can do 7/12 of the work in 8 days. This means that in one day, they can do (7/12) / 8 of the work. Let's call this rate of work R1.

R1 = (7/12) / 8

Now, Jinwoo alone finishes the remaining work in 10 days. The remaining work is 5/12 of the total work (since 7/12 has been completed). Let's denote Jinwoo's rate of work as Rj.

Rj = (5/12) / 10

We want to find out how many days it will take Seongmin to finish the entire work by himself. Let's denote Seongmin's rate of work as Rs and the number of days it would take him to finish the work as Ds.

Since Jinwoo and Seongmin together have a combined rate of R1, we can express this as:

R1 = Rj + Rs

We already have R1 and Rj, so we can solve for Rs:

Rs = R1 - Rj

Now, we can find Ds by dividing the total work W by Rs:

Ds = W / Rs

Let's calculate R1 and Rj first:

R1 = (7/12) / 8 = 7/96 (work per day)

Rj = (5/12) / 10 = 1/24 (work per day)

Now, we can find Rs:

Rs = R1 - Rj
Rs = 7/96 - 1/24
Rs = 7/96 - 4/96
Rs = 3/96
Rs = 1/32 (work per day)

Finally, we can find Ds:

Ds = W / Rs
Ds = 1 / (1/32)
Ds = 32 days

So, it will take Seongmin 32 days to finish the task by himself.
Question: If there are 3 bus routes and 2 subway routes going from Seohee's house to school, find the number of ways to go by bus or subway.
Answer: To find the total number of ways Seohee can go to school by bus or subway, we simply add the number of bus routes to the number of subway routes.

Number of bus routes = 3
Number of subway routes = 2

Total number of ways = Number of bus routes + Number of subway routes
Total number of ways = 3 + 2
Total number of ways = 5

So, there are 5 different ways Seohee can go to school by bus or subway.
Question: Junseop's hair is 9 centimeters (cm) 8 millimeters (mm) long, Taehun's hair is 8.9 centimeters (cm), and Hayul's hair is 9.3 centimeters (cm) long. Which of the three friends has the shortest hair?
Answer: To compare the lengths of the hair of Junseop, Taehun, and Hayul, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit. Since Taehun's and Hayul's hair lengths are already in centimeters, we only need to convert Junseop's hair length from centimeters and millimeters to centimeters.

Junseop's hair is 9 centimeters and 8 millimeters long. There are 10 millimeters in a centimeter, so 8 millimeters is equal to 0.8 centimeters. Therefore, Junseop's hair length in centimeters is:

9 cm + 0.8 cm = 9.8 cm

Now we can compare the lengths:

- Junseop's hair: 9.8 cm
- Taehun's hair: 8.9 cm
- Hayul's hair: 9.3 cm

Taehun has the shortest hair at 8.9 cm.
Question: There are 45 apples. There are 21 fewer pears than apples. How many tangerines are there if there are 18 fewer pears than tangerines?

Question: Subtracting 46 from a number gives 15 as a result. What would be the result if 29 is subtracted from this number?
Answer: Let's call the unknown number "x".

According to the first statement, subtracting 46 from x gives 15:
x - 46 = 15

To find the value of x, we add 46 to both sides of the equation:
x - 46 + 46 = 15 + 46
x = 61

Now, we want to know the result if 29 is subtracted from this number (x = 61):
61 - 29 = 32

So, the result would be 32.
Question: How many times the volume of a cube with an edge of 1 meter (m) is the volume of a cuboid with a width of 50 centimeters (cm), a length of 50 centimeters (cm) and a height of 20 centimeters (cm)?
Answer: First, let's calculate the volume of the cube with an edge of 1 meter. Since the edge is 1 meter, the volume of the cube (V_cube) is:

V_cube = edge^3
V_cube = 1m * 1m * 1m
V_cube = 1 cubic meter (m^3)

Now, let's calculate the volume of the cuboid with a width of 50 cm, a length of 50 cm, and a height of 20 cm. To make the units consistent, we need to convert the dimensions of the cuboid from centimeters to meters. There are 100 centimeters in a meter, so:

Width in meters = 50 cm / 100 = 0.5 m
Length in meters = 50 cm / 100 = 0.5 m
Height in meters = 20 cm / 100 = 0.2 m

Now we can calculate the volume of the cuboid (V_cuboid):

V_cuboid = width * length * height
V_cuboid = 0.5m * 0.5m * 0.2m
V_cuboid = 0.05 cubic meters (m^3)

To find out how many times the volume of the cube is the volume of the cuboid, we divide the volume of the cube by the volume of the cuboid:

Number of times = V_cube / V_cuboid
Number of times = 1 m^3 / 0.05 m^3
Number of times = 20

So, the volume of the cube is 20 times the volume of the cuboid.

Question: The sum of the weights of the bags of 10 people traveling together on a European tour is divided by 42, there is no rest, and the quotient is 10. Suji, one of the party, bought a souvenir and the bag weighed 50 kg (kg). If the average weight of the bags is 44 kilograms (kg), how many kilograms (kg) does the Suji bag weigh before buying the souvenir?
Answer: Let's start by finding the total weight of the bags of the 10 people before Suji bought the souvenir. We know that the average weight of the bags is 44 kg, so the total weight of the bags is:

Total weight = Average weight × Number of people
Total weight = 44 kg/person × 10 people
Total weight = 440 kg

Now, we are told that when the sum of the weights of the bags is divided by 42, the quotient is 10 and there is no remainder. This means that the total weight of the bags is a multiple of 42, and that multiple is 10. So the total weight of the bags is:

Total weight = Quotient × Divisor
Total weight = 10 × 42
Total weight = 420 kg

There seems to be a discrepancy here because the total weight we calculated using the average (440 kg) is not the same as the total weight that is a multiple of 42 (420 kg). Let's assume that the total weight that is a multiple of 42 is the correct total weight of the bags before Suji bought the souvenir.

Now, after Suji bought the souvenir, her bag weighed 50 kg. We need to find out how much her bag weighed before that. Since the total weight of the bags before the souvenir was 420 kg, and the total weight after the souvenir is 440 kg (because the average weight of 44 kg for 10 people gives us 440 kg), the difference must be the weight of the souvenir.

Weight of the souvenir = Total weight after souvenir - Total weight before souvenir
Weight of the souvenir = 440 kg - 420 kg
Weight of the souvenir = 20 kg

So, the souvenir Suji bought weighed 20 kg. Now we can find out how much her bag weighed before she bought the souvenir:

Weight of Suji's bag before souvenir = Weight of Suji's bag after souvenir - Weight of the souvenir
Weight of Suji's bag before souvenir = 50 kg - 20 kg
Weight of Suji's bag before souvenir = 30 kg

Therefore, Suji's bag weighed 30 kg before she bought the souvenir.
Question: The red tape is 11/6 meters (m), the blue tape is 7/4 meters (m), and the yellow tape is 13/8 meters (m). Which tape is the longest?
Answer: To determine which tape is the longest, we need to compare the lengths of the red, blue, and yellow tapes. Since the lengths are given as fractions, we can compare them by finding a common denominator or converting them to decimal form.

Let's convert each fraction to decimal form:

Red tape: 11/6 m = 1.8333... m (repeating)
Blue tape: 7/4 m = 1.75 m
Yellow tape: 13/8 m = 1.625 m

Now that we have the decimal equivalents, we can easily compare the lengths:

Red tape: 1.8333... m
Blue tape: 1.75 m
Yellow tape: 1.625 m

The red tape, at 1.8333... meters, is the longest.
Question: Jihye and Yonghee shared 85 marbles. If Jihye got 11 more marbles than Yonghee, how many marbles did Jihye got?
Answer: Let's denote the number of marbles Yonghee got as Y. Since Jihye got 11 more marbles than Yonghee, Jihye got Y + 11 marbles.

According to the information given, the total number of marbles they have together is 85. So we can write the equation:

Y + (Y + 11) = 85

Combining like terms, we get:

2Y + 11 = 85

Subtracting 11 from both sides, we get:

2Y = 85 - 11
2Y = 74

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

Y = 74 / 2
Y = 37

So Yonghee got 37 marbles. Since Jihye got 11 more marbles than Yonghee, Jihye got:

37 + 11 = 48 marbles

Therefore, Jihye got 48 marbles.

Question: Tigers are said to run 3.8 kilometers (km) per hour. How many kilometers (km) could the tiger run without stopping in 2 hours and 45 minutes?
Answer: To calculate the distance a tiger could run without stopping in 2 hours and 45 minutes, we first need to convert the time into hours since the speed is given in kilometers per hour (km/h).

2 hours and 45 minutes is equivalent to 2 hours + (45 minutes / 60 minutes per hour) = 2 + 0.75 hours = 2.75 hours.

Now, we can use the speed of the tiger to calculate the distance:

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 3.8 km/h × 2.75 hours

Distance = 10.45 km

So, the tiger could run 10.45 kilometers without stopping in 2 hours and 45 minutes.
Question: Minjae's class collected clothes they do not wear for donation. If the male student's clothes are 2.6 kilograms (kg) and the female student's clothes are 5.98 kilograms (kg), what is the total weight of the clothes collected?
Answer: To find the total weight of the clothes collected, you simply need to add the weight of the male student's clothes to the weight of the female student's clothes.

Male student's clothes: 2.6 kg
Female student's clothes: 5.98 kg

Total weight = Male student's clothes + Female student's clothes
Total weight = 2.6 kg + 5.98 kg
Total weight = 8.58 kg

The total weight of the clothes collected is 8.58 kilograms.

Question: Find the number of common multiples of 16 and 24 that are no more than 200.
Answer: To find the common multiples of 16 and 24, we first need to find their least common multiple (LCM). The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both numbers.

The prime factorization of 16 is 2^4.
The prime factorization of 24 is 2^3 * 3.

To find the LCM, we take the highest powers of the prime factors from each number:
LCM = 2^4 * 3 = 16 * 3 = 48.

Now we need to find all the multiples of 48 that are no more than 200. We do this by dividing 200 by 48:

200 ÷ 48 = 4 with a remainder.

This means that there are 4 multiples of 48 up to 200 (since we only consider whole numbers). To list them out:

1st multiple: 48 * 1 = 48
2nd multiple: 48 * 2 = 96
3rd multiple: 48 * 3 = 144
4th multiple: 48 * 4 = 192

There are no more multiples of 48 up to 200 because the next multiple, 48 * 5 = 240, is greater than 200.

Therefore, there are 4 common multiples of 16 and 24 that are no more than 200.
Question: They are going to give each person 2/5 of a pizza. How many pizzas are needed to serve 10 people?
Answer: To find out how many pizzas are needed to serve 10 people, where each person gets 2/5 of a pizza, you can set up the following calculation:

Number of pizzas needed = (Number of people) x (Fraction of pizza per person)

Number of pizzas needed = 10 x (2/5)

To calculate this, you can multiply the number of people by the numerator of the fraction and then divide by the denominator:

Number of pizzas needed = (10 x 2) / 5
Number of pizzas needed = 20 / 5
Number of pizzas needed = 4

So, you would need 4 whole pizzas to serve 10 people, with each person getting 2/5 of a pizza.
Question: 18 is the result of multiplying a number by 2. What do you get when you subtract 4 from this number?

Question: You have a square piece of paper with a side length of 10 centimeters (cm). How many right triangle-shaped pieces with a base of 1 centimeter (cm) and a hight of 3 centimeters (cm) can you cut out from this piece of paper?
Answer: To determine how many right triangle-shaped pieces with a base of 1 cm and a height of 3 cm can be cut out from a square piece of paper with a side length of 10 cm, we need to calculate the area of the square and the area of one of the right triangles, and then divide the area of the square by the area of the triangle.

The area of the square (A_square) is given by the formula:
A_square = side_length^2
A_square = 10 cm * 10 cm
A_square = 100 cm^2

The area of the right triangle (A_triangle) is given by the formula:
A_triangle = (base * height) / 2
A_triangle = (1 cm * 3 cm) / 2
A_triangle = 3 cm^2 / 2
A_triangle = 1.5 cm^2

Now, we divide the area of the square by the area of the triangle to find out how many triangles can fit in the square:
Number of triangles = A_square / A_triangle
Number of triangles = 100 cm^2 / 1.5 cm^2
Number of triangles = 66.66...

Since we cannot have a fraction of a triangle, we can only cut out 66 whole right triangle-shaped pieces from the square piece of paper.
Question: There are four numbers 10, 11, 12, and 13. Which number is the second smallest?

Question: Taehyung jumped rope 56 times a day for 3 days and Namjoon did 35 times a day for 4 days. How many times did Taehyung and Namjoon jump rope?
Answer: To find out how many times Taehyung and Namjoon jumped rope, we need to multiply the number of times they jumped each day by the number of days they did it and then add the two results together.

For Taehyung:
56 times/day * 3 days = 168 times

For Namjoon:
35 times/day * 4 days = 140 times

Now, we add the two results together:
168 times (Taehyung) + 140 times (Namjoon) = 308 times

Taehyung and Namjoon jumped rope a total of 308 times.

So, the difference between the largest number and the next largest number is 1.
Question: Seonwoo's school's 3rd graders have 4 classes with 21 students in each class. All 3rd graders are trying to plant 2 seeds in their pots. How many seeds do they need in all?
Answer: There are 4 classes of 3rd graders with 21 students in each class. To find the total number of 3rd graders, we multiply the number of classes by the number of students in each class:

4 classes * 21 students/class = 84 students

Each student is trying to plant 2 seeds in their pots. To find the total number of seeds needed, we multiply the total number of students by the number of seeds each student needs:

84 students * 2 seeds/student = 168 seeds

Therefore, they need a total of 168 seeds for all the 3rd graders to plant 2 seeds each.

Question: 3 bottles of 0.2 liters (L) of milk are delivered to Minjeong's house every day. Find how many liters (L) of all the milk was delivered to Minjeong's house for a week.
Answer: To find the total amount of milk delivered to Minjeong's house for a week, we need to multiply the daily delivery amount by the number of days in a week.

Each day, 3 bottles of 0.2 liters of milk are delivered. So, the daily delivery amount is:
3 bottles/day * 0.2 liters/bottle = 0.6 liters/day

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of milk delivered in a week is:
0.6 liters/day * 7 days/week = 4.2 liters/week

Therefore, 4.2 liters of milk were delivered to Minjeong's house for a week.
Question: Minjae and his father picked apples. Minjae gained 2.6 kilograms (kg), and his father 5.98 kilograms (kg). How many kilograms (kg) are all the apples Minjae and his father picked?
Answer: To find the total weight of the apples Minjae and his father picked, you simply need to add the weight of the apples Minjae picked to the weight of the apples his father picked.

Minjae picked: 2.6 kg
His father picked: 5.98 kg

Total weight of apples = Minjae's apples + Father's apples
Total weight of apples = 2.6 kg + 5.98 kg
Total weight of apples = 8.58 kg

Minjae and his father picked a total of 8.58 kilograms of apples.
Question: The area of a rectangle divided by a diagonal is 576 square centimeters (cm2). If the width of the rectangle is 32 centimeters (cm), what is the height in centimeters (cm)?
Answer: Let's denote the width of the rectangle as \( w \) and the height as \( h \). The area of the rectangle is given by \( A = w \times h \).

According to the problem, the area of the rectangle divided by a diagonal is 576 cm². The diagonal of a rectangle divides it into two right-angled triangles, each with an area of \( \frac{1}{2} \times w \times h \). Therefore, the area of one of these triangles is \( \frac{1}{2} \times A \).

Given that \( w = 32 \) cm, we can write the area of the rectangle as \( A = 32 \times h \).

Now, we know that the area of one of the triangles formed by the diagonal is 576 cm², so we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times A = 576 \]

Substituting \( A = 32 \times h \) into the equation, we get:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times (32 \times h) = 576 \]

\[ 16 \times h = 576 \]

Now, we can solve for \( h \):

\[ h = \frac{576}{16} \]

\[ h = 36 \]

Therefore, the height of the rectangle is 36 centimeters.

Question: The faucet is filling the water tank at the speed of 36.6 liters (l) per minute, but there is a hole in the bottom of the tank, so that water leaks out of the tank at the speed of 2.4 liters (l) per minute. If the water tank contained 10 liters (l) of water initially, how many liters (l) of water is in the water tank after 7 minutes 45 seconds?
Answer: First, let's convert the time from minutes and seconds to just minutes to make the calculation easier. We have 7 minutes and 45 seconds, which is 7 minutes plus 45 seconds. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, 45 seconds is equal to 45/60 minutes.

45/60 = 0.75 minutes

So, the total time in minutes is 7 + 0.75 = 7.75 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the net rate at which the water is filling the tank. The faucet fills the tank at 36.6 liters per minute, and the hole leaks water at 2.4 liters per minute. So the net rate of water filling the tank is:

36.6 liters/minute (filling) - 2.4 liters/minute (leaking) = 34.2 liters/minute (net filling rate)

Now we can calculate the amount of water that is added to the tank in 7.75 minutes at the net filling rate:

34.2 liters/minute * 7.75 minutes = 265.05 liters

However, we must remember that the tank already contained 10 liters of water initially. So, the total amount of water in the tank after 7.75 minutes is:

Initial water + Added water = 10 liters + 265.05 liters = 275.05 liters

Therefore, after 7 minutes and 45 seconds, there are 275.05 liters of water in the water tank.

Question: If 31 is 13 less than a certain number, find a number that is 11 greater than this certain number.
Answer: Let's call the certain number "x". According to the information given, 31 is 13 less than x. So we can write the equation:

x - 13 = 31

Now, we need to solve for x:

x = 31 + 13
x = 44

Now that we have found the certain number (x = 44), we need to find a number that is 11 greater than this certain number. So we add 11 to x:

44 + 11 = 55

Therefore, the number that is 11 greater than the certain number is 55.

Question: Yesterday, Eunji's uncle gave Eunji some pocket money. Eunji bought a notebook with half of her pocket money, and when she received an additional 550 won from her mother today, her money became 1,000 won. How much money did she get from her uncle?
Answer: Let's denote the amount of pocket money Eunji received from her uncle as X won.

According to the information given, Eunji spent half of her pocket money on a notebook. So, she spent X/2 won on the notebook.

After buying the notebook, she had X/2 won left.

Today, Eunji's mother gave her an additional 550 won. So, the money she had after receiving the additional amount is (X/2 + 550 won).

We are told that after receiving the additional 550 won, Eunji has a total of 1,000 won. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

X/2 + 550 won = 1,000 won

Now, let's solve for X:

X/2 = 1,000 won - 550 won
X/2 = 450 won

To find the total amount Eunji received from her uncle, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

X = 450 won * 2
X = 900 won

Therefore, Eunji received 900 won from her uncle.
Question: The amount of water used per day is 215 liters (L). How many liters (L) of water are saved when you save 0.32 times?
Answer: To calculate the amount of water saved when you save 0.32 times the daily usage, you multiply the daily usage by the savings factor:

Amount of water saved = Daily water usage × Savings factor
Amount of water saved = 215 L × 0.32
Amount of water saved = 68.8 L

Therefore, when you save 0.32 times the daily water usage, you save 68.8 liters of water.
Question: A small square is made by dividing a square with a side of 20 centimeters (cm) into thirds. Find the area of the newly created small square in square centimeters (cm2), rounded to two decimal places.
Answer: To find the area of the newly created small square, we first need to determine the side length of the small square.

Since the original square with a side of 20 cm is divided into thirds, each third will have a side length of \( \frac{20}{3} \) cm.

The area of a square is found by squaring the side length. So, the area of the small square is:

\( \left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 \) cm²

\( = \frac{400}{9} \) cm²

\( = 44.44 \) cm² (rounded to two decimal places)

So, the area of the newly created small square is 44.44 cm².
Question: Hoseok had 576 marbles, and Yoongi had 352. If Hoseok gives Yoongi 100 marbles, who has more marbles?

Question: If the area of a piece of paper in the shape of a rhombus is 80 square centimeters (cm2) and one diagonal is 16 centimeters (cm), how long is the other diagonal in centimeters (cm)?
Answer: The area of a rhombus can be calculated using the formula:

Area = (d1 * d2) / 2

where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals.

We are given that the area is 80 cm² and one diagonal (d1) is 16 cm. We can use this information to solve for the other diagonal (d2):

80 = (16 * d2) / 2

To find d2, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

160 = 16 * d2

Now, divide both sides by 16 to solve for d2:

d2 = 160 / 16
d2 = 10 cm

So, the length of the other diagonal is 10 cm.
Question: Jimin has 5 100-won coins and 1 50-won coin, and Seokjin has 2 100-won coins and 7 10-won coins. Find out the sum of the money they both have.
Answer: To find the sum of the money Jimin and Seokjin have, we need to calculate the total amount of money each of them has and then add those amounts together.

Jimin has:
- 5 100-won coins
- 1 50-won coin

Seokjin has:
- 2 100-won coins
- 7 10-won coins

Let's calculate the total for each person:

Jimin's total:
\( (5 \times 100) + (1 \times 50) = 500 + 50 = 550 \) won

Seokjin's total:
\( (2 \times 100) + (7 \times 10) = 200 + 70 = 270 \) won

Now, let's add the totals together to find the sum of the money they both have:

\( 550 + 270 = 820 \) won

So, the sum of the money Jimin and Seokjin have is 820 won.

Question: There is one black go stone and two white go stones. How many ways are there to place 3 go stones in a row?
Answer: To determine the number of ways to place 3 Go stones in a row, we need to consider the different permutations of the stones. Since we have 1 black stone (B) and 2 white stones (W1, W2), we can treat the white stones as distinct for the purpose of counting and then divide by the permutations of the identical items (the white stones) to get the correct count.

The permutations of the three stones, treating the white stones as distinct, are as follows:

1. B W1 W2
2. B W2 W1
3. W1 B W2
4. W1 W2 B
5. W2 B W1
6. W2 W1 B

Since the two white stones are actually identical, each arrangement that is different only by the swapping of the two white stones is actually the same arrangement. Therefore, we divide the total number of permutations by the number of permutations of the two identical white stones, which is 2! (2 factorial) or 2.

So the number of unique ways to place the stones is 6 (permutations treating white stones as distinct) / 2 (permutations of the identical white stones) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 unique ways to place 3 Go stones in a row with the given configuration of stones.
Question: There is a red tissue and a blue tissue. If the red tissue is 12 centimeters (cm) longer than the blue tissue, and twice the length of the red tissue equals three times the length of the blue tissue, find the length of the blue tissue.
Answer: Let's denote the length of the blue tissue as \( B \) cm and the length of the red tissue as \( R \) cm.

According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. The red tissue is 12 cm longer than the blue tissue:
\[ R = B + 12 \]

2. Twice the length of the red tissue equals three times the length of the blue tissue:
\[ 2R = 3B \]

Now we can use these two equations to solve for \( B \).

From the first equation, we can express \( R \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ R = B + 12 \]

Substitute this expression for \( R \) into the second equation:
\[ 2(B + 12) = 3B \]

Now, distribute the 2 on the left side of the equation:
\[ 2B + 24 = 3B \]

Next, we want to get all the terms with \( B \) on one side of the equation and the constants on the other side. We can do this by subtracting \( 2B \) from both sides:
\[ 24 = 3B - 2B \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 24 = B \]

So, the length of the blue tissue is 24 cm.
Question: When you divide a particular number by 10, you get 6. What number do you get when you subtract 15 from that particular number?

Question: There are 247 first-year students at Junseo's school, and 131 more sophomores than first-year students. If you are going to distribute one loaf to each first grader and second grader, how many loaves do you need to prepare in total?
Answer: To find out the total number of loaves needed, we first need to determine the number of sophomores at Junseo's school. Since there are 131 more sophomores than first-year students, we can calculate the number of sophomores as follows:

Number of sophomores = Number of first-year students + 131
Number of sophomores = 247 + 131
Number of sophomores = 378

Now, to find the total number of loaves needed, we add the number of first-year students to the number of sophomores:

Total number of loaves = Number of first-year students + Number of sophomores
Total number of loaves = 247 + 378
Total number of loaves = 625

Therefore, you need to prepare 625 loaves in total.
Question: The three-digit number A3B is greater than 300 and less than 400. Also, it is divisible by 3 and a multiple of 7. What is B?
Answer: To find the value of B, we need to find a three-digit number A3B that is between 300 and 400, divisible by 3, and a multiple of 7.

Since the number is between 300 and 400, A must be 3. So the number is in the form of 33B.

For a number to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. The sum of the digits in 33B is 3 + 3 + B = 6 + B. For this sum to be divisible by 3, B must be one of the following digits: 0, 3, 6, or 9.

Now, we need to check which of these values for B will make 33B a multiple of 7.

Let's check each possibility:

1. If B = 0, the number is 330. 330 ÷ 7 = 47 with a remainder of 1, so it's not a multiple of 7.
2. If B = 3, the number is 333. 333 ÷ 7 = 47 with a remainder of 4, so it's not a multiple of 7.
3. If B = 6, the number is 336. 336 ÷ 7 = 48 with no remainder, so it is a multiple of 7.
4. If B = 9, the number is 339. 339 ÷ 7 = 48 with a remainder of 3, so it's not a multiple of 7.

The only value of B that makes 33B a multiple of 7 is 6. Therefore, B = 6.
Question: There is a box 9 centimeters (cm) wide, 4 centimeters (cm) long, and 7 centimeters (cm) high. What is the volume of this box in cubic centimeters (cm3)?
Answer: The volume of a box (rectangular prism) can be calculated by multiplying its width, length, and height together. 

Volume = Width × Length × Height

Given the dimensions:
Width = 9 cm
Length = 4 cm
Height = 7 cm

Volume = 9 cm × 4 cm × 7 cm
Volume = 36 cm² × 7 cm
Volume = 252 cm³

So, the volume of the box is 252 cubic centimeters (cm³).

Question: The sum of the weights of the bags of 10 people traveling together on a European tour is divided by 42, there is no rest, and the quotient is 10. Suji, one of the party, bought a souvenir and the bag weighed 50 kg (kg). If the average weight of the bags is 44 kilograms (kg), how many kilograms (kg) does the Suji bag weigh before buying the souvenir?
Answer: Let's start by finding the total weight of the bags of the 10 people before Suji bought the souvenir. We know that the average weight of the bags is 44 kg, so the total weight of the bags is:

Total weight = Average weight × Number of people
Total weight = 44 kg/person × 10 people
Total weight = 440 kg

Now, we are told that when the sum of the weights of the bags is divided by 42, the quotient is 10 and there is no remainder. This means that the total weight of the bags is a multiple of 42, and that multiple is 10. So the total weight of the bags is:

Total weight = Quotient × Divisor
Total weight = 10 × 42
Total weight = 420 kg

There seems to be a discrepancy here because the total weight we calculated using the average (440 kg) is not the same as the total weight that is a multiple of 42 (420 kg). Let's assume that the total weight that is a multiple of 42 is the correct total weight of the bags before Suji bought the souvenir.

Now, after Suji bought the souvenir, her bag weighed 50 kg. We need to find out how much her bag weighed before that. Since the total weight of the bags before the souvenir was 420 kg, and the total weight after the souvenir is 440 kg (because the average weight of 44 kg for 10 people gives us 440 kg), the difference must be the weight of the souvenir.

Weight of the souvenir = Total weight after souvenir - Total weight before souvenir
Weight of the souvenir = 440 kg - 420 kg
Weight of the souvenir = 20 kg

So, the souvenir Suji bought weighed 20 kg. Now we can find out how much her bag weighed before she bought the souvenir:

Weight of Suji's bag before souvenir = Weight of Suji's bag after souvenir - Weight of the souvenir
Weight of Suji's bag before souvenir = 50 kg - 20 kg
Weight of Suji's bag before souvenir = 30 kg

Therefore, Suji's bag weighed 30 kg before she bought the souvenir.
Question: 169 is 108 greater than a certain number. What number is 125 greater than the certain number?
Answer: Let's call the certain number "x".

According to the information given, 169 is 108 greater than x. So we can write the equation:

169 = x + 108

Now, we want to find out what number is 125 greater than x. To find x, we first solve the equation above:

x = 169 - 108
x = 61

Now that we know x is 61, we can find the number that is 125 greater than x by adding 125 to x:

61 + 125 = 186

So, the number that is 125 greater than the certain number (x) is 186.
Question: They are going to give each person 2/5 of a pizza. How many pizzas are needed to serve 10 people?
Answer: To find out how many pizzas are needed to serve 10 people, where each person gets 2/5 of a pizza, you can set up the following calculation:

Number of pizzas needed = (Number of people) x (Fraction of pizza per person)

Number of pizzas needed = 10 x (2/5)

To calculate this, you can multiply the number of people by the numerator of the fraction and then divide by the denominator:

Number of pizzas needed = (10 x 2) / 5
Number of pizzas needed = 20 / 5
Number of pizzas needed = 4

So, you would need 4 whole pizzas to serve 10 people, with each person getting 2/5 of a pizza.

Question: A prism has 24 vertices, and all edges are 5 centimeters (cm) long. What is the sum of the lengths of all the edges of this prism in centimeters (cm)?
Answer: To find the sum of the lengths of all the edges of the prism, we need to know how many edges the prism has. Since the prism has 24 vertices, we can deduce that it is not a standard prism (like a triangular prism or a rectangular prism) because those have fewer vertices.

However, we can use the Euler's formula for polyhedra to find the number of edges (E). Euler's formula states that for any convex polyhedron (which includes prisms), the number of vertices (V), the number of edges (E), and the number of faces (F) are related by the following formula:

V - E + F = 2

We know V = 24 (the number of vertices). We need to find E (the number of edges). We don't know F (the number of faces), but we can deduce it if we know the shape of the prism. Since we don't have that information, we cannot directly use Euler's formula to find the number of edges.

However, if we assume that the prism is a regular polyhedron (which is not stated but could be a reasonable assumption given the uniform edge length), the only regular polyhedron with 24 vertices is the truncated octahedron, which is an Archimedean solid, not a prism. The truncated octahedron has 36 edges.

If we assume that the prism is a truncated octahedron, then the sum of the lengths of all the edges would be:

Sum of edge lengths = Number of edges × Length of each edge
Sum of edge lengths = 36 edges × 5 cm/edge
Sum of edge lengths = 180 cm

So, if the prism is a truncated octahedron, the sum of the lengths of all the edges would be 180 cm. However, without more specific information about the shape of the prism, we cannot definitively determine the sum of the lengths of all the edges.
Question: You are attaching posters measuring 30 centimeters (cm) in width and 20 centimeters (cm) in height to the wall. 15 posters are to be attached horizontally in succession, overlapping each other by 2 centimeters (cm). Find the minimum width of the wall in centimeters (cm) to attach all the posters. 
Answer: To find the minimum width of the wall needed to attach all the posters, we need to calculate the total width of the posters when they are placed side by side with an overlap of 2 cm.

Since the posters are overlapping by 2 cm, each poster after the first one will contribute 30 cm - 2 cm = 28 cm to the total width.

The first poster will contribute its full width of 30 cm since it does not overlap with any poster on its left side.

So, for 15 posters, we have 1 poster contributing 30 cm and the remaining 14 posters contributing 28 cm each.

The total width required is:
\( Total width = Width of first poster + (Number of remaining posters \times Overlapping width) \)
\( Total width = 30 cm + (14 \times 28 cm) \)
\( Total width = 30 cm + 392 cm \)
\( Total width = 422 cm \)

Therefore, the minimum width of the wall needed to attach all the posters is 422 centimeters.
Question: If there are 41 students in Seonghoe's class, and there are 3 more students walking to school than those using public transportation, find out how many students walk to school.
Answer: Let's denote the number of students who walk to school as W and the number of students who use public transportation as P. According to the information given, we have:

W = P + 3

We also know that the total number of students in Seonghoe's class is 41, so:

W + P = 41

Now we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

(P + 3) + P = 41

Combine like terms:

2P + 3 = 41

Subtract 3 from both sides:

2P = 38

Divide both sides by 2:

P = 19

Now that we know the number of students using public transportation is 19, we can find out how many students walk to school by using the first equation:

W = P + 3
W = 19 + 3
W = 22

So, 22 students walk to school.

There are 6 three-digit numbers that satisfy the given conditions.
Question: How many total four-digit numbers can be formed by using all the natural numbers 2, 5, 6, and 9 without overlapping?
Answer: To form a four-digit number using the digits 2, 5, 6, and 9 without repeating any of them, we can use each digit exactly once. Since there are four different digits and each digit can be placed in any of the four positions of the four-digit number, we can calculate the total number of four-digit numbers that can be formed as follows:

For the first position, we can choose any of the 4 digits.
For the second position, we can choose any of the remaining 3 digits.
For the third position, we can choose any of the remaining 2 digits.
For the fourth position, we are left with only 1 digit.

So, the total number of four-digit numbers that can be formed is the product of these choices:

4 (choices for the first digit) × 3 (choices for the second digit) × 2 (choices for the third digit) × 1 (choice for the fourth digit) = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24

Therefore, 24 different four-digit numbers can be formed using the digits 2, 5, 6, and 9 without repeating any of them.

Question: A and B are single-digit numbers. What is the sum of the number of all A's and the number of all B's such that 3/12<A/12<7/12 and 1/10<1/B<1/3?
Answer: Let's solve each inequality step by step.

For the first inequality:
\[ \frac{3}{12} < \frac{A}{12} < \frac{7}{12} \]

Since all terms are divided by 12, we can multiply through by 12 to get rid of the denominators:
\[ 3 < A < 7 \]

This means A can be any single-digit number between 3 and 7, not including 3 and 7. So A can be 4, 5, or 6. That's 3 possible values for A.

Now for the second inequality:
\[ \frac{1}{10} < \frac{1}{B} < \frac{1}{3} \]

We can find a common denominator to make it easier to compare the fractions:
\[ \frac{1}{10} < \frac{1}{B} < \frac{3}{10} \]

Now, we can invert the inequality to find the range for B:
\[ 10 > B > \frac{10}{3} \]

Since B is a single-digit number, B can be 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. That's 6 possible values for B.

Now, we add the number of possible values for A and B:
\[ 3 (A's) + 6 (B's) = 9 \]

So the sum of the number of all A's and the number of all B's is 9.
Question: There are 300 grams (g) of 8% sugar water. How many grams (g) of water are added to this sugar water to make 5% sugar water?
Answer: Let's denote the amount of water to be added as \( x \) grams.

Initially, we have 300 grams of 8% sugar water, which means there are \( 300 \times 0.08 = 24 \) grams of sugar in the solution.

After adding \( x \) grams of water, the total weight of the solution becomes \( 300 + x \) grams.

We want the new solution to be 5% sugar, so the amount of sugar (which remains 24 grams since we are only adding water) should be 5% of the total weight of the new solution.

So, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{24}{300 + x} = 0.05 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[ 24 = 0.05 \times (300 + x) \]
\[ 24 = 15 + 0.05x \]
\[ 24 - 15 = 0.05x \]
\[ 9 = 0.05x \]
\[ x = \frac{9}{0.05} \]
\[ x = 180 \]

Therefore, 180 grams of water need to be added to the sugar water to make a 5% sugar water solution.

Answer: Let's denote the number on A's card as A, the number on B's card as B, and the number on C's card as C.

We are given that the average of the three number cards is 143, so we can write the following equation:

(A + B + C) / 3 = 143

Multiplying both sides by 3, we get:

A + B + C = 429  (Equation 1)

We are also given that A's card plus 4.5 is the average of B and C's, so we can write:

A + 4.5 = (B + C) / 2

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

2A + 9 = B + C  (Equation 2)

Finally, we are told that the number on C's card is 3 less than B's, so we can write:

C = B - 3  (Equation 3)

Now we have three equations and three unknowns. We can solve these equations to find the values of A, B, and C.

First, let's substitute Equation 3 into Equation 2:

2A + 9 = B + (B - 3)

2A + 9 = 2B - 3

Now let's solve for A in terms of B:

2A = 2B - 3 - 9

2A = 2B - 12

A = B - 6  (Equation 4)

Now we can substitute Equations 3 and 4 into Equation 1:

(B - 6) + B + (B - 3) = 429

3B - 9 = 429

3B = 429 + 9

3B = 438

B = 438 / 3

B = 146

Now that we have the value of B, we can find C using Equation 3:

C = B - 3

C = 146 - 3

C = 143

Therefore, the number on C's card is 143.
Question: Suppose that street trees are planted on the road that is 2575 meters (m) long at intervals of 25 meters (m). How many street trees will be planted? (However, trees are also planted at the beginning and end of the road.)
Answer: 2575 meters / 25 meters = 103 trees (excluding the trees at the beginning and end of the road)

Since trees are also planted at the beginning and end of the road, we need to add 2 trees to the total:

103 + 2 =

Question: I mistakenly subtracted a number that should be multiplied by 423, and I got 421. Find the value of subtracting 500 from the sum of the correctly calculated and incorrectly calculated values.
Answer: Let's call the number that should have been multiplied by 423 as "x".

The incorrect calculation was a subtraction, and you got 421. So the incorrect calculation is:
423 - x = 421

To find the correct calculation, we need to multiply 423 by x:
423 * x

Now, we need to solve for x in the incorrect calculation:
423 - x = 421
x = 423 - 421
x = 2

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the correctly calculated value:
423 * x = 423 * 2 = 846

Now we have both the incorrectly calculated value (421) and the correctly calculated value (846). We need to find the sum of these two values and then subtract 500:
Sum = 421 + 846 = 1267

Subtracting 500 from the sum:
1267 - 500 = 767

So the value of subtracting 500 from the sum of the correctly calculated and incorrectly calculated values is 767.
Question: You have a rectangle with a perimeter of 48 centimeters (cm). If the length of this rectangle is 2 centimeters (cm) longer than its width, how long is its width in centimeters (cm)?
Answer: Let's denote the width of the rectangle as \( w \) cm and the length as \( l \) cm. According to the problem, the length is 2 cm longer than the width, so we can express the length as \( l = w + 2 \) cm.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula \( P = 2l + 2w \). We know the perimeter is 48 cm, so we can set up the equation:

\[ 48 = 2(w + 2) + 2w \]

Now, let's solve for \( w \):

\[ 48 = 2w + 4 + 2w \]
\[ 48 = 4w + 4 \]
\[ 48 - 4 = 4w \]
\[ 44 = 4w \]
\[ w = \frac{44}{4} \]
\[ w = 11 \]

So, the width of the rectangle is 11 cm.
Question: If 31 is 13 less than a certain number, find a number that is 11 greater than this certain number.
Answer: Let's call the certain number "x". According to the information given, 31 is 13 less than x. So we can write the equation:

x - 13 = 31

Now, we need to solve for x:

x = 31 + 13
x = 44

Now that we have found the certain number (x = 44), we need to find a number that is 11 greater than this certain number. So we add 11 to x:

44 + 11 = 55

Therefore, the number that is 11 greater than the certain number is 55.

Question: When 9 is multiplied by a number, the result is 36. Find out the number exactly.
Answer: To find the number that, when multiplied by 9, gives 36, you can set up the equation:

9 * x = 36

To solve for x, divide both sides of the equation by 9:

x = 36 / 9

x = 4

So the number is exactly 4.
Question: There are three numbers 10, 11, and 12. Which number is the largest?
Answer: The largest number among 10, 11, and 12 is 12.
Question: What is the sum of the numbers greater than or equal to 0.4 among 0.8, 1/2, 0.3, and 1/3?
Answer: To find the sum of the numbers greater than or equal to 0.4 among 0.8, 1/2, 0.3, and 1/3, we first need to determine which of these numbers meet the condition.

0.8 is greater than 0.4.
1/2 is equal to 0.5 when converted to a decimal, which is also greater than 0.4.
0.3 is less than 0.4.
1/3 is approximately equal to 0.3333 (repeating), which is less than 0.4.

So, we only need to sum 0.8 and 1/2 (0.5).

0.8 + 0.5 = 1.3

The sum of the numbers greater than or equal to 0.4 among the given numbers is 1.3.

Question: Subtracting 10 from a number yields 15. How much do you get if you add 5 to this number?
Answer: Let's call the original number "x". According to the first statement, subtracting 10 from x gives us 15:

x - 10 = 15

To find the value of x, we add 10 to both sides of the equation:

x - 10 + 10 = 15 + 10
x = 25

Now, if we add 5 to this number (x), we get:

25 + 5 = 30

So, if you add 5 to the original number, you get 30.
Question: If 45 utility poles are lined up on a straight road at intervals of 60 meters (m), what is the distance in kilometers (km) between the two poles that are farthest apart?
Answer: If there are 45 utility poles lined up at intervals of 60 meters, then there are 44 intervals between the poles (since the first pole doesn't count as an interval).

To find the total distance between the first and the last pole, we multiply the number of intervals by the distance of each interval:

44 intervals * 60 meters/interval = 2640 meters

To convert meters to kilometers, we divide by 1000 (since there are 1000 meters in a kilometer):

2640 meters / 1000 = 2.64 kilometers

So, the distance between the two poles that are farthest apart is 2.64 kilometers.
Question: In the orchard, 170 apples, 268 tangerines, and 120 mangoes were loaded equally into each of trucks. There are 8 apples left, 2 tangerines short, and 12 mangoes left. Find the maximum number of trucks in the orchard.
Answer: To find the maximum number of trucks, we need to determine the number of fruits that can be loaded equally into each truck. Since there are leftovers and shortages, we need to adjust the total count of each fruit to reflect the number that can be evenly distributed.

For apples, we have 170 apples with 8 left over, so the number that can be evenly distributed is 170 - 8 = 162 apples.

For tangerines, we are 2 short, so we need to add 2 to the total to find the number that can be evenly distributed: 268 + 2 = 270 tangerines.

For mangoes, we have 120 mangoes with 12 left over, so the number that can be evenly distributed is 120 - 12 = 108 mangoes.

Now, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these three numbers (162, 270, and 108) to determine the maximum number of trucks that can be used to evenly distribute the fruits.

Let's find the GCD:

GCD of 162 and 270:
162 = 2 × 3^4 × 1
270 = 2 × 3^3 × 5

The common factors are 2 and 3^3 (which is 27), so the GCD of 162 and 270 is 2 × 27 = 54.

Now, let's find the GCD of 54 and 108:
54 = 2 × 3^3
108 = 2^2 × 3^3

The common factors are 2 and 3^3 (which is 27), so the GCD of 54 and 108 is 2 × 27 = 54.

Since the GCD of all three numbers is 54, this means that the fruits can be evenly distributed into 54 trucks. However, since we are looking for the maximum number of trucks, we need to divide each of the adjusted fruit totals by 54 to see if they all divide evenly.

162 ÷ 54 = 3 (evenly distributed)
270 ÷ 54 = 5 (evenly distributed)
108 ÷ 54 = 2 (evenly distributed)

Since all three numbers divide evenly by 54, the maximum number of trucks that can be used to evenly distribute the fruits is 54.

Question: How many cases can you make a number that is 10 or more and 100 or less by selecting two cards from 1, 7, and 9?
Answer: To make a number that is 10 or more and 100 or less by selecting two cards from 1, 7, and 9, we can form two-digit numbers by placing one card in the tens place and the other in the ones place. We can't use the same card twice since we only have one of each card.

Here are the possible combinations:

1. 17 (1 in the tens place and 7 in the ones place)
2. 71 (7 in the tens place and 1 in the ones place)
3. 19 (1 in the tens place and 9 in the ones place)
4. 91 (9 in the tens place and 1 in the ones place)
5. 79 (7 in the tens place and 9 in the ones place)
6. 97 (9 in the tens place and 7 in the ones place)

All of these numbers are between 10 and 100. Therefore, there are 6 cases where you can make a number that is 10 or more and 100 or less by selecting two cards from 1, 7, and 9.
Question: There are 247 first-year students at Junseo's school, and 131 more sophomores than first-year students. If you are going to distribute one loaf to each first grader and second grader, how many loaves do you need to prepare in total?
Answer: To find out the total number of loaves needed, we first need to determine the number of sophomores at Junseo's school. Since there are 131 more sophomores than first-year students, we can calculate the number of sophomores as follows:

Number of sophomores = Number of first-year students + 131
Number of sophomores = 247 + 131
Number of sophomores = 378

Now, to find the total number of loaves needed, we add the number of first-year students to the number of sophomores:

Total number of loaves = Number of first-year students + Number of sophomores
Total number of loaves = 247 + 378
Total number of loaves = 625

Therefore, you need to prepare 625 loaves in total.
Question: The distance from the house to the library is 2 + 13/40 kilometers (km), and from the house to the bank is 2.56 kilometers (km). Which is farther from home, the library or the bank?
Answer: To determine which is farther from home, we need to compare the distances to the library and the bank.

The distance to the library is given as 2 + 13/40 kilometers. Let's convert this to a decimal to make it easier to compare with the distance to the bank.

First, we convert 13/40 to a decimal:
13 ÷ 40 = 0.325

Now, we add this to the whole number part of the distance to the library:
2 + 0.325 = 2.325 kilometers

The distance to the bank is 2.56 kilometers.

Comparing the two distances:
Library: 2.325 km
Bank: 2.56 km

The bank is farther from home since 2.56 km is greater than 2.325 km.
Question: You have a square with a perimeter of 17.8 centimeters (cm). How many centimeters (cm) is one side of this figure?

Question: You have a rectangle with a perimeter of 48 centimeters (cm). If the length of this rectangle is 2 centimeters (cm) longer than its width, how long is its width in centimeters (cm)?
Answer: Let's denote the width of the rectangle as \( w \) cm and the length as \( l \) cm. According to the problem, the length is 2 cm longer than the width, so we can express the length as \( l = w + 2 \) cm.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula \( P = 2l + 2w \). We know the perimeter is 48 cm, so we can set up the equation:

\[ 48 = 2(w + 2) + 2w \]

Now, let's solve for \( w \):

\[ 48 = 2w + 4 + 2w \]
\[ 48 = 4w + 4 \]
\[ 48 - 4 = 4w \]
\[ 44 = 4w \]
\[ w = \frac{44}{4} \]
\[ w = 11 \]

So, the width of the rectangle is 11 cm.
Question: Of the five numbers 1.4, 9/10, 1.2, 0.5, and 13/10, how many are less than 1.1?
Answer: To determine how many of the given numbers are less than 1.1, we need to compare each number to 1.1.

1.4 is greater than 1.1.
9/10 is equal to 0.9, which is less than 1.1.
1.2 is greater than 1.1.
0.5 is less than 1.1.
13/10 is equal to 1.3, which is greater than 1.1.

So, out of the five numbers, two of them (9/10 and 0.5) are less than 1.1.
Question: There are 135.1 liters (L) of water. If this is divided into 7 liters (L) buckets of water, how many buckets can be filled?
Answer: To find out how many 7-liter buckets can be filled with 135.1 liters of water, you divide the total amount of water by the capacity of each bucket:

135.1 liters ÷ 7 liters/bucket = 19.3 buckets

Since you can't have a fraction of a bucket, you can only completely fill 19 buckets with 7 liters each. The remaining water would not be enough to fill another full 7-liter bucket.
