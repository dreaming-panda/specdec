Question: Jimin's school uses 7000 liters (l) of water per day. Find how many days it will take for the water used at Jimin's school to reach 100000 liters (l).
Answer: To find out how many days it will take for the water used at Jimin's school to reach 100,000 liters, we need to divide the total amount of water to be used by the amount of water used per day.

Total amount of water to be used: 100,000 liters
Amount of water used per day: 7,000 liters

Number of days = Total amount of water to be used / Amount of water used per day
Number of days = 100,000 liters / 7,000 liters per day
Number of days = 14.2857 days

Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we'll round up to the nearest whole day. Therefore, it will take 15 days for the water used at Jimin's school to reach 100,000 liters.

Question: There are fifteen pieces of square-shaped colored paper with a side length of 25 centimeters (cm) glued together. Given that they were overlapped by 0.5 centimeters (cm) to connect them having a maximum length of one side of the paper, find its length in meters (m).
Answer: To find the total length of the paper, we need to consider the overlap between each piece of paper. Since each piece of paper is 25 cm in length and they overlap by 0.5 cm, the effective length added by each additional piece of paper is 25 cm - 0.5 cm.

For the first piece of paper, we have the full length of 25 cm. For each subsequent piece, we add 24.5 cm (since 0.5 cm is overlapped).

With 15 pieces of paper, we have one full piece and 14 additional pieces that contribute an effective length of 24.5 cm each.

The total length in centimeters is:
25 cm + (14 * 24.5 cm)

Now, let's calculate that:
25 cm + (14 * 24.5 cm) = 25 cm + 343 cm
Total length = 368 cm

To convert centimeters to meters, we divide by 100 (since 1 meter = 100 centimeters).

Total length in meters = 368 cm / 100
Total length in meters = 3.68 m

So, the length of the paper in meters is 3.68 m.

Question: There are three bottles, A, B, and C, each with different sizes. 7 bottles of A and 3 bottles of B have the same capacity, and 1 bottle of B and 5 bottles of C are the same. How many bottles of C are equal to 21 bottles of A?
Answer: Let's denote the capacity of bottle A as \( a \), bottle B as \( b \), and bottle C as \( c \).

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. \( 7a = 3b \) (7 bottles of A have the same capacity as 3 bottles of B)
2. \( b = 5c \) (1 bottle of B has the same capacity as 5 bottles of C)

We want to find out how many bottles of C are equal to 21 bottles of A.

First, let's express \( b \) in terms of \( a \) using the first equation:

\[ 7a = 3b \]
\[ b = \frac{7a}{3} \]

Now, let's substitute \( b \) in the second equation with \( \frac{7a}{3} \):

\[ b = 5c \]
\[ \frac{7a}{3} = 5c \]

Now, we want to find the equivalent number of bottles of C for 21 bottles of A. Let's express 21 bottles of A in terms of \( c \):

\[ 21a = x \cdot c \]

We need to find \( x \), the number of bottles of C that are equivalent to 21 bottles of A. To do this, we can use the relationship we found between \( a \) and \( c \):

\[ \frac{7a}{3} = 5c \]
\[ a = \frac{15c}{7} \]

Now, substitute \( a \) in the equation for 21 bottles of A:

\[ 21 \cdot \frac{15c}{7} = x \cdot c \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 3 \cdot 15c = x \cdot c \]
\[ 45c = x \cdot c \]

Now, divide both sides by \( c \) to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 45 \]

Therefore, 21 bottles of A are equal to 45 bottles of C.

Question: The conch-shaped bread is 250 grams (g) and I made two boxes with 12 each. The Red-bean bread is 200 grams (g) and is made into three boxes with 16 each. Which bread is in the box that weighs more than other boxes?
Answer: First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of bread per box.

For the conch-shaped bread:
Each bread weighs 250 grams and there are 12 in a box, so:
250 grams/bread * 12 breads/box = 3000 grams/box

For the Red-bean bread:
Each bread weighs 200 grams and there are 16 in a box, so:
200 grams/bread * 16 breads/box = 3200 grams/box

Comparing the two:
- A box of conch-shaped bread weighs 3000 grams.
- A box of Red-bean bread weighs 3200 grams.

The box with the Red-bean bread weighs more than the box with the conch-shaped bread.

Question: There are 56 tulips. Red tulips are 3/7 of the total. Blue tulips are 3/8 of the total. If the rest are pink tulips, how many pink tulips are there?
Answer: First, let's find out how many red tulips there are. Since red tulips are 3/7 of the total, we can calculate the number of red tulips by multiplying the total number of tulips by 3/7:

Number of red tulips = (3/7) * 56

Now, let's find out how many blue tulips there are. Since blue tulips are 3/8 of the total, we can calculate the number of blue tulips by multiplying the total number of tulips by 3/8:

Number of blue tulips = (3/8) * 56

Finally, to find out how many pink tulips there are, we subtract the number of red and blue tulips from the total number of tulips:

Number of pink tulips = Total tulips - (Number of red tulips + Number of blue tulips)

Let's do the calculations:

Number of red tulips = (3/7) * 56 = 3 * 8 = 24
Number of blue tulips = (3/8) * 56 = 3 * 7 = 21

Number of pink tulips = 56 - (24 + 21) = 56 - 45 = 11

So, there are 11 pink tulips.

Question: Find the sum of odd numbers from 100 to 200.
Answer: To find the sum of odd numbers from 100 to 200, we first need to identify the first and last odd numbers in this range.

The first odd number after 100 is 101, and the last odd number before 200 is 199.

Now, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

Sum = n/2 * (first term + last term)

where n is the number of terms.

To find n, we can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:

last term = first term + (n - 1) * common difference

Here, the common difference is 2 (since we are looking at odd numbers, which are 2 units apart).

199 = 101 + (n - 1) * 2

Solving for n:

199 = 101 + 2n - 2
199 = 99 + 2n
100 = 2n
n = 50

So, there are 50 odd numbers between 100 and 200.

Now, we can find the sum:

Sum = 50/2 * (101 + 199)
Sum = 25 * (300)
Sum = 7500

Therefore, the sum of odd numbers from 100 to 200 is 7500.

Question: 55 students participated in A competition and B competition. Among them, 38 students participated in A  competition, and 42 students participated in B competition. If no student did not participate in neither competitions A nor B, how many students participated in both competitions?
Answer: Let's denote the number of students who participated in both competitions as X.

According to the problem, we have the following information:

- The total number of students who participated in at least one of the competitions is 55.
- The number of students who participated in competition A is 38.
- The number of students who participated in competition B is 42.

We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of students who participated in both competitions. The principle of inclusion-exclusion states that for any two sets, the size of their union is equal to the sum of the sizes of each set minus the size of their intersection.

In this case, the union of the two sets (students who participated in competition A and students who participated in competition B) is the total number of students who participated in at least one competition, which is 55.

So, we have:

Number of students in A + Number of students in B - Number of students in both A and B = Total number of students

38 (A) + 42 (B) - X (Both A and B) = 55

80 - X = 55

X = 80 - 55

X = 25

Therefore, 25 students participated in both competitions A and B.

Question: The faucet is filling the water tank at the speed of 36.6 liters (l) per minute, but there is a hole in the bottom of the tank, so that water leaks out of the tank at the speed of 2.4 liters (l) per minute. If the water tank contained 10 liters (l) of water initially, how many liters (l) of water is in the water tank after 7 minutes 45 seconds?
Answer: First, let's convert the time from minutes and seconds to just minutes to make the calculation easier. We have 7 minutes and 45 seconds, which is 7 minutes plus 45 seconds. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, 45 seconds is equal to 45/60 minutes.

45/60 = 0.75 minutes

So, the total time in minutes is 7 + 0.75 = 7.75 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the net rate at which the water is filling the tank. The faucet fills the tank at 36.6 liters per minute, and the hole leaks water at 2.4 liters per minute. So the net rate of water filling the tank is:

36.6 liters/minute (filling) - 2.4 liters/minute (leaking) = 34.2 liters/minute (net filling rate)

Now we can calculate the amount of water that is added to the tank in 7.75 minutes at the net filling rate:

34.2 liters/minute * 7.75 minutes = 265.05 liters

However, we must remember that the tank already contained 10 liters of water initially. So, the total amount of water in the tank after 7.75 minutes is:

Initial water + Added water = 10 liters + 265.05 liters = 275.05 liters

Therefore, after 7 minutes and 45 seconds, there are 275.05 liters of water in the water tank.

Question: A theater ticket is rectangular in shape, measuring 28 centimeters (cm) in perimeter and 6 centimeters (cm) in width. Find the area of this theater ticket.
Answer: To find the area of the rectangular theater ticket, we need to know both its width and length. We already know the width is 6 cm. We can use the perimeter to find the length.

The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:
P = 2 * (length + width)

We know the perimeter is 28 cm, so we can set up the equation:
28 = 2 * (length + 6)

Now, we can solve for the length:
28 = 2 * length + 12
28 - 12 = 2 * length
16 = 2 * length
length = 16 / 2
length = 8 cm

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can find the area (A) of the rectangle using the formula:
A = length * width

Substitute the known values:
A = 8 cm * 6 cm
A = 48 cm²

The area of the theater ticket is 48 square centimeters.
Question: The exchange rate refers to the rate at which one country's currency is exchanged for another country's currency. Soojeong came back from a trip to the U.S. and exchanged the remaining 140 dollars for 158,760 won in Korean money at the bank today. What is the exchange rate of the Korean Won to the US Dollar today?

Answer: 140 USD = 158,760 KRW

To find the exchange rate, we need to divide the number of Korean Won (KRW) by the number of US Dollars (USD):

Exchange rate = KRW / USD
= 158,760 KRW / 140

Question: Find the sum of odd numbers from 100 to 200.
Answer: To find the sum of odd numbers from 100 to 200, we first need to identify the first and last odd numbers in this range.

The first odd number after 100 is 101, and the last odd number before 200 is 199.

Now, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

Sum = n/2 * (first term + last term)

where n is the number of terms.

To find n, we can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:

last term = first term + (n - 1) * common difference

Here, the common difference is 2 (since we are looking at odd numbers, which are 2 units apart).

199 = 101 + (n - 1) * 2

Solving for n:

199 = 101 + 2n - 2
199 = 99 + 2n
100 = 2n
n = 50

So, there are 50 odd numbers between 100 and 200.

Now, we can find the sum:

Sum = 50/2 * (101 + 199)
Sum = 25 * (300)
Sum = 7500

Therefore, the sum of odd numbers from 100 to 200 is 7500.

Question: Yoongi bought a 250 won candy at the mart and received 500 won as pocket money. After that, he spent half of my money on a pencil, and he had 420 won left. How much money did Yoongi have at first?
Answer: Let's break down the transactions step by step to find out how much money Yoongi had at first.

1. Yoongi bought a candy for 250 won.
2. He received 500 won as pocket money.
3. He spent half of his money on a pencil.
4. He had 420 won left.

First, we need to find out how much money Yoongi spent on the pencil. Since he had 420 won left after buying the pencil, and this amount represents the other half of his money (because he spent half on the pencil), we can double the 420 won to find out the total amount he had before buying the pencil.

420 won (amount left) * 2 = 840 won (total amount before buying the pencil)

Now, we know that the 840 won includes the 500 won pocket money he received. So, before receiving the pocket money, Yoongi had:

840 won (total before buying the pencil) - 500 won (pocket money) = 340 won

Finally, we need to add back the cost of the candy to find out how much money Yoongi had at first, because he spent 250 won on the candy before receiving the pocket money.

340 won (before pocket money) + 250 won (cost of candy) = 590 won

So, Yoongi had 590 won at first before he bought the candy and received his pocket money.

Question: When you add 99 to a certain number and multiply that by 17, it becomes 3111. Find that number in question.
Answer: Let's call the certain number "x". According to the problem, when you add 99 to x and then multiply the result by 17, you get 3111. We can write this as an equation:

17 * (x + 99) = 3111

Now, let's solve for x:

First, divide both sides of the equation by 17 to isolate the term with x:

(x + 99) = 3111 / 17
(x + 99) = 183

Now, subtract 99 from both sides to solve for x:

x = 183 - 99
x = 84

So, the number in question is 84.

Question: There is a red tissue and a blue tissue. If the red tissue is 12 centimeters (cm) longer than the blue tissue, and twice the length of the red tissue equals three times the length of the blue tissue, find the length of the blue tissue.
Answer: Let's denote the length of the blue tissue as \( B \) cm and the length of the red tissue as \( R \) cm.

According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. The red tissue is 12 cm longer than the blue tissue:
\[ R = B + 12 \]

2. Twice the length of the red tissue equals three times the length of the blue tissue:
\[ 2R = 3B \]

Now we can use these two equations to solve for \( B \).

From the first equation, we can express \( R \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ R = B + 12 \]

Substitute this expression for \( R \) into the second equation:
\[ 2(B + 12) = 3B \]

Now, distribute the 2 on the left side of the equation:
\[ 2B + 24 = 3B \]

Next, we want to get all the terms with \( B \) on one side of the equation and the constants on the other side. We can do this by subtracting \( 2B \) from both sides:
\[ 24 = 3B - 2B \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 24 = B \]

So, the length of the blue tissue is 24 cm.

Since 17 is an odd number and 2 is an even number, when 17 is divided by 2, it will not divide evenly. The largest multiple of 2 that is less than 17 is 16 (which is 2 * 8). Therefore, the quotient A is 8.

To find the remainder B, we subtract the product of the quotient and the divisor (2 * A) from the original number (17):

B = 17 - (2 * A)
B = 17 - (2 * 8)
B = 17 - 16
B = 1

So the remainder B is 1.

Question: What is the probability of getting a card with a number less than or equal to 9 when you draw one of the number cards 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, or 9?
Answer: To find the probability of drawing a card with a number less than or equal to 9 from the given set of number cards (1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9), we need to count the number of favorable outcomes and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes.

In this case, all the cards in the set (1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9) have numbers less than or equal to 9. Therefore, every card in the set is a favorable outcome.

The number of favorable outcomes (cards with a number less than or equal to 9) is 6 (since there are 6 cards in the set).

The total number of possible outcomes (total number of cards in the set) is also 6.

So, the probability (P) of drawing a card with a number less than or equal to 9 is:

P = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes
P = 6 / 6
P = 1

The probability of drawing a card with a number less than or equal to 9 from this set of cards is 1, which means it is certain to happen.

Question: 24 is the value of a number multiplied by 2/5. What number do you get when the number is multiplied by 1/15?
Answer: Let's call the original number "x". According to the information given, when x is multiplied by 2/5, the result is 24. We can write this as an equation:

(2/5)x = 24

To find the value of x, we need to solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 2/5:

x = 24 / (2/5)

To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal. The reciprocal of 2/5 is 5/2. So we have:

x = 24 * (5/2)

x = (24 * 5) / 2

x = 120 / 2

x = 60

Now that we have the value of x, we can find out what number we get when x is multiplied by 1/15:

(1/15)x = (1/15) * 60

To multiply, we simply multiply the numerators and denominators:

= (1 * 60) / (15 * 1)

= 60 / 15

= 4

So, when the original number (which is 60) is multiplied by 1/15, the result is 4.
Question: Find A that satisfies 32×A×A×A=42592

Question: Yongchan walked 1.05 kilometers (km) in 10 minutes. If Yongchan walked 460 meters (m) longer than Min-joo, how many kilometers (km) did Min-joo walk?
Answer: First, we need to convert the distance Yongchan walked from kilometers to meters to make it easier to compare with the distance Min-joo walked. 

1 kilometer is equal to 1000 meters. So, Yongchan walked:
1.05 km * 1000 m/km = 1050 meters

Now, we know that Yongchan walked 460 meters more than Min-joo. So, to find out how much Min-joo walked, we subtract 460 meters from Yongchan's distance:

1050 meters - 460 meters = 590 meters

Min-joo walked 590 meters. To convert this back to kilometers:

590 meters / 1000 m/km = 0.59 kilometers

Min-joo walked 0.59 kilometers.

Question: I have two different numbers, A and B. Find B from the two-digit addition equation 6A+B2=77.
Answer: To solve for B in the equation 6A + B2 = 77, we need to understand that A and B are single-digit numbers since they are part of a two-digit addition equation. The equation can be interpreted as a two-digit number (6A) plus a two-digit number (B2) equals 77.

Let's break down the two-digit numbers:

- The first two-digit number has a tens digit of 6 and a ones digit of A, so the number is 60 + A.
- The second two-digit number has a tens digit of B and a ones digit of 2, so the number is 10B + 2.

Now, let's rewrite the equation with this understanding:

(60 + A) + (10B + 2) = 77

Combine like terms:

60 + A + 10B + 2 = 77

Now, simplify the equation:

62 + A + 10B = 77

Subtract 62 from both sides to isolate A and 10B:

A + 10B = 77 - 62
A + 10B = 15

Since A and B are single-digit numbers, the only way for A + 10B to equal 15 is if A is 5 and B is 1. This is because 10B must be a multiple of 10 and the only single-digit value for B that would make 10B + A equal to 15 is when B is 1.

So, B = 1.

Question: Minjae's class collected clothes they do not wear for donation. If the male student's clothes are 2.6 kilograms (kg) and the female student's clothes are 5.98 kilograms (kg), what is the total weight of the clothes collected?
Answer: To find the total weight of the clothes collected, you simply need to add the weight of the male student's clothes to the weight of the female student's clothes.

Male student's clothes: 2.6 kg
Female student's clothes: 5.98 kg

Total weight = Male student's clothes + Female student's clothes
Total weight = 2.6 kg + 5.98 kg
Total weight = 8.58 kg

The total weight of the clothes collected is 8.58 kilograms.

Question: They are going to give each person 2/5 of a pizza. How many pizzas are needed to serve 10 people?
Answer: To find out how many pizzas are needed to serve 10 people, where each person gets 2/5 of a pizza, you can set up the following calculation:

Number of pizzas needed = (Number of people) x (Fraction of pizza per person)

Number of pizzas needed = 10 x (2/5)

To calculate this, you can multiply the number of people by the numerator of the fraction and then divide by the denominator:

Number of pizzas needed = (10 x 2) / 5
Number of pizzas needed = 20 / 5
Number of pizzas needed = 4

So, you would need 4 whole pizzas to serve 10 people, with each person getting 2/5 of a pizza.

Question: When 11 is divided by the natural number A, the remainder is 2 and the quotient is 3. Find the value of A at this time.
Answer: To find the value of A, we can use the formula for division:

Dividend = (Divisor × Quotient) + Remainder

In this case, the dividend is 11, the quotient is 3, and the remainder is 2. Let's denote the divisor by A. Plugging in the values we have:

11 = (A × 3) + 2

Now, we can solve for A:

11 - 2 = A × 3
9 = A × 3
A = 9 / 3
A = 3

So the value of A is 3.

Question: Seonho wants to cut 1 large cube of wood into several small cubes of wood. The length of a side of a small block of wood is 1/4 of the length of a side of a block of large wood. Find the number of small wooden blocks that can be made at this time.
Answer: To find the number of small cubes that can be made from the large cube, we need to determine how many times the volume of a small cube fits into the volume of the large cube.

Let's denote the length of a side of the large cube as L. Then the length of a side of a small cube would be L/4.

The volume of the large cube (V_large) is:
V_large = L^3

The volume of a small cube (V_small) is:
V_small = (L/4)^3
V_small = L^3/64

Now, to find the number of small cubes that can be made from the large cube, we divide the volume of the large cube by the volume of the small cube:

Number of small cubes = V_large / V_small
Number of small cubes = L^3 / (L^3/64)
Number of small cubes = 64

So, Seonho can make 64 small cubes from the large cube.

Question: Some number minus 7 returns 9. What will be the answer if the number is multiplied by 5?
Answer: Let's call the number we're looking for "x". According to the first statement:

x - 7 = 9

To find x, we add 7 to both sides of the equation:

x = 9 + 7

Now, if we multiply this number by 5:

16 * 5 = 80

So the answer is 80.

Question: How many four-digit numbers can be formed by using 1, 3, 6, and 8 only once?
Answer: To form a four-digit number using the digits 1, 3, 6, and 8, each digit must be used exactly once. 

For the first digit (the thousands place), we have 4 choices (1, 3, 6, or 8). 
For the second digit (the hundreds place), we have 3 remaining choices (since one digit has already been used for the thousands place). 
For the third digit (the tens place), we have 2 remaining choices (since two digits have already been used for the thousands and hundreds places). 
For the fourth digit (the ones place), we have only 1 remaining choice (since three digits have already been used for the thousands, hundreds, and tens places).

Therefore, the total number of four-digit numbers that can be formed is the product of the number of choices for each place:

4 (choices for the first digit) × 3 (choices for the second digit) × 2 (choices for the third digit) × 1 (choice for the fourth digit) = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24.

So, 24 different four-digit numbers can be formed using the digits 1, 3, 6, and 8, each used only once.

Question: Jimin's social studies score is 6 points higher than his science score. The science score is 87. If the average score for science, social studies, and English is 92, what is his English score?
Answer: First, let's find Jimin's social studies score. Since it is 6 points higher than his science score, we can calculate it as follows:

Social Studies Score = Science Score + 6
Social Studies Score = 87 + 6
Social Studies Score = 93

Now we know his science score is 87 and his social studies score is 93.

The average score for science, social studies, and English is given as 92. The average is calculated by adding all the scores together and then dividing by the number of subjects. In this case, there are 3 subjects.

Let's denote Jimin's English score as E.

The average is calculated as follows:

Average = (Science Score + Social Studies Score + English Score) / Number of Subjects
92 = (87 + 93 + E) / 3

Now we solve for E:

92 = (180 + E) / 3
92 * 3 = 180 + E
276 = 180 + E
E = 276 - 180
E = 96

Jimin's English score is 96.

Question: If you add -5/12 and subtract -5/2 from a number, it becomes 1/3. What is the number?
Answer: Let's call the number we are looking for "x". According to the problem, if we add -5/12 to x and then subtract -5/2 from the result, we get 1/3. We can write this as an equation:

x + (-5/12) - (-5/2) = 1/3

First, let's simplify the equation by removing the parentheses and remembering that subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive:

x - 5/12 + 5/2 = 1/3

Now, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions so that we can combine them. The least common denominator (LCD) for 12, 2, and 3 is 12. So we convert each fraction to have a denominator of 12:

x - 5/12 + (5/2) * (6/6) = (1/3) * (4/4)

x - 5/12 + 30/12 = 4/12

Now we can combine the fractions:

x + (30/12 - 5/12) = 4/12

x + 25/12 = 4/12

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 25/12 from both sides:

x = 4/12 - 25/12

x = (-21/12)

Now we can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:

x = (-21 ÷ 3) / (12 ÷ 3)

x = -7/4

So the number we are looking for is -7/4.

Question: Suhwan's car traveled 15.5 kilometers (km) in 10 minutes. How many kilometers (km) would he travel in 46 minutes at this speed?
Answer: To find out how many kilometers Suhwan would travel in 46 minutes at the same speed, we first need to determine his speed in kilometers per minute.

He traveled 15.5 kilometers in 10 minutes, so his speed is:

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 15.5 km / 10 min
Speed = 1.55 km/min

Now that we know his speed, we can calculate how far he would travel in 46 minutes:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 1.55 km/min * 46 min
Distance = 71.3 km

So, Suhwan would travel 71.3 kilometers in 46 minutes at this speed.

Question: Divide this number by 2.5, subtract 10.5 from it, and multiply that by 0.3 to get 5.85. Find this number.
Answer: Let's call the number you're looking for "x". According to the instructions, we first divide x by 2.5, then subtract 10.5 from the result, and finally multiply that result by 0.3 to get 5.85. We can write this as an equation:

0.3 * ((x / 2.5) - 10.5) = 5.85

Now, let's solve for x step by step.

First, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 0.3 to isolate the term with x:

((x / 2.5) - 10.5) = 5.85 / 0.3

Now, calculate 5.85 / 0.3:

((x / 2.5) - 10.5) = 19.5

Next, we'll add 10.5 to both sides to isolate the term with x:

(x / 2.5) = 19.5 + 10.5

(x / 2.5) = 30

Now, we'll multiply both sides by 2.5 to solve for x:

x = 30 * 2.5

x = 75

So, the number you're looking for is 75.

Question: The TV license fee is 30 won per 10 seconds. If Mingyu watched TV for 2 minutes and 40 seconds, how much would the license fee be?
Answer: First, we need to convert the time Mingyu watched TV into seconds. 

2 minutes and 40 seconds is equal to (2 * 60) + 40 seconds, which is 120 + 40 seconds, totaling 160 seconds.

Now, we know the TV license fee is 30 won per 10 seconds. To find out how many 10-second intervals are in 160 seconds, we divide 160 by 10, which gives us 16 intervals.

Finally, we multiply the number of intervals by the fee per interval to find the total cost:

16 intervals * 30 won per interval = 480 won

So, the license fee for watching TV for 2 minutes and 40 seconds would be 480 won.

Question: It is said that Gyeonghun climbed the mountain at a speed of 3 kilometers (km) per hour when going up, and 4 kilometers (km) per hour when going down as he changed the route, which takes 2 kilometers (km) longer than the previous one. If he took a total of 4 hours for climbing, how long did it take to go up?
Answer: Let's denote the time it took Gyeonghun to go up the mountain as \( t_{up} \) hours and the time to go down as \( t_{down} \) hours. We know that the total time for the climb is 4 hours, so:

\[ t_{up} + t_{down} = 4 \]

We also know that Gyeonghun's speed going up is 3 km/h and going down is 4 km/h. Let's denote the distance going up as \( d_{up} \) km and the distance going down as \( d_{down} \) km. We are told that the route going down is 2 km longer than the route going up, so:

\[ d_{down} = d_{up} + 2 \]

Using the relationship between speed, distance, and time, we can express the time taken to go up and down in terms of distance:

\[ t_{up} = \frac{d_{up}}{3} \]
\[ t_{down} = \frac{d_{down}}{4} \]

Now we can substitute \( d_{down} \) in terms of \( d_{up} \) into the second equation:

\[ t_{down} = \frac{d_{up} + 2}{4} \]

Now we have two equations with two variables (\( t_{up} \) and \( d_{up} \)). We can substitute \( t_{up} \) and \( t_{down} \) into the first equation:

\[ \frac{d_{up}}{3} + \frac{d_{up} + 2}{4} = 4 \]

To solve for \( d_{up} \), we need to find a common denominator and combine the fractions:

\[ \frac{4d_{up}}{12} + \frac{3(d_{up} + 2)}{12} = 4 \]

\[ \frac{4d_{up} + 3d_{up} + 6}{12} = 4 \]

\[ 7d_{up} + 6 = 48 \]

\[ 7d_{up} = 42 \]

\[ d_{up} = 6 \]

Now that we have \( d_{up} \), we can find \( t_{up} \):

\[ t_{up} = \frac{d_{up}}{3} \]

\[ t_{up} = \frac{6}{3} \]

\[ t_{up} = 2 \]

So, it took Gyeonghun 2 hours to go up the mountain.

Question: When you multiply a number by 7 and then add 21.28, you get 50.68. Find a number.
Answer: Let's call the number you're looking for "x". According to the problem, when you multiply this number by 7 and then add 21.28, you get 50.68. We can write this as an equation:

7x + 21.28 = 50.68

Now, we want to solve for x. First, we'll subtract 21.28 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with x:

7x + 21.28 - 21.28 = 50.68 - 21.28
7x = 29.40

Next, we'll divide both sides by 7 to solve for x:

7x / 7 = 29.40 / 7
x = 4.2

So the number you're looking for is 4.2.

Question: Some number minus 7 returns 9. What will be the answer if the number is multiplied by 5?
Answer: Let's call the number we're looking for "x". According to the first statement:

x - 7 = 9

To find x, we add 7 to both sides of the equation:

x = 9 + 7
x = 16

Now, if we multiply this number by 5:

16 * 5 = 80

So the answer is 80.
Question: The rectangular shape of the ttakji's area is 1.77 square centimeters (cm2). If the width of this ttakji is 3 centimeters (cm), how many centimeters (cm) will the length be?
Answer: 1.77 cm2 is the area of the ttakji. We can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the length:

Area = Length * Width
1.77 = Length * 3

To find the length, we divide both sides of

Question: Fifteen sheets of colored tape, each 25 centimeters (cm) long, were joined together with an overlap of 0.5 centimeters (cm). How many meters (m) is the total length of the continuous color tape?
Answer: To find the total length of the continuous colored tape, we need to subtract the overlap from each sheet of tape and then add them all together.

Each sheet of tape is 25 cm long, and there is an overlap of 0.5 cm for each connection between two sheets. Since there are 15 sheets, there will be 14 overlaps (because the first sheet doesn't need to overlap with a previous one).

The total length of overlap for all the sheets is:
14 overlaps * 0.5 cm/overlap = 7 cm

Now, we subtract the total overlap from the total length of the 15 sheets if there were no overlaps:
Total length without overlaps = 15 sheets * 25 cm/sheet = 375 cm

Subtracting the overlaps:
Total length with overlaps = 375 cm - 7 cm = 368 cm

To convert centimeters to meters, we divide by 100 (since there are 100 centimeters in a meter):
Total length in meters = 368 cm / 100 = 3.68 m

So, the total length of the continuous colored tape is 3.68 meters.

Question: When you wrongly multiplied a number that should have been divided by 2.4, you got 288. What is the correctly calculated value divided by 5?
Answer: If you multiplied a number by 2.4 instead of dividing by 2.4 and got 288, we can find the original number by dividing 288 by 2.4:

\( \frac{288}{2.4} = 120 \)

So the original number, before you should have divided by 2.4, is 120.

Now, to find the correctly calculated value divided by 5, we first need to divide the original number by 2.4, as it should have been:

\( \frac{120}{2.4} = 50 \)

Then, we divide this result by 5:

\( \frac{50}{5} = 10 \)

So the correctly calculated value divided by 5 is 10.

Question: You made 5 identical rectangles by cutting a square-shaped paper whose side is 40 centimeters (cm) long. How many centimeters (cm) is the length of the shorter side of a rectangle when it has the largest area?
Answer: To maximize the area of the rectangles, we need to cut the square in such a way that the rectangles are as large as possible. Since we are making 5 identical rectangles, we have a few options on how to cut the square. We can cut the square into 5 strips either along its length or its width.

The area of the square is \(40 \text{ cm} \times 40 \text{ cm} = 1600 \text{ cm}^2\). When we divide this area by 5 to get the area of each rectangle, we get \(1600 \text{ cm}^2 / 5 = 320 \text{ cm}^2\) for each rectangle.

Now, let's consider the possible ways to cut the square to create the rectangles:

1. Cut the square into 5 strips along its length (40 cm side). Each strip would then have a length of 40 cm and a width of \(40 \text{ cm} / 5 = 8 \text{ cm}\). The area of each rectangle would be \(40 \text{ cm} \times 8 \text{ cm} = 320 \text{ cm}^2\), which matches our calculated area for each rectangle.

2. Cut the square into 5 strips along its width (40 cm side). This would result in the same dimensions as the first option, with each rectangle having a length of 40 cm and a width of 8 cm.

Since the question asks for the length of the shorter side of the rectangle when it has the largest area, and we've determined that the area is maximized when the rectangles are cut along the length or width of the square, the length of the shorter side of the rectangle is 8 cm.
Question: I have to divide a number by 8, but I accidentally multiply a number by 6 is 96. What is the correct calculation result?

To find the number, we multiply both sides of the equation by 6:

number = 11 * 6

number = 66

So, the number Hoseok used is 66.

Question: I had to add 40 to a certain number, but I accidentally multiply 21 by that number and the result is 63. How much is it if I calculate it correctly?
Answer: Let's call the certain number "x". According to the information given, you accidentally multiplied 21 by x instead of adding 40 to x. The result of this incorrect operation was 63.

So the equation for the incorrect operation is:

21 * x = 63

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 21:

x = 63 / 21
x = 3

Now that we know x is 3, we can calculate the correct operation, which is adding 40 to x:

Correct result = x + 40
Correct result = 3 + 40
Correct result = 43

So if you calculate it correctly by adding 40 to the certain number, the result is 43.

So the equation for this operation is:

2 * x = 18

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by

Question: Find the number of ways to draw 3 people among Namjoon, Yoongi, Hoseok, and Minyoung and put them in a line.
Answer: To find the number of ways to draw 3 people from a group of 4 (Namjoon, Yoongi, Hoseok, and Minyoung) and put them in a line, we can use the formula for permutations since the order matters.

The number of permutations of n objects taken r at a time is given by:

nPr = n! / (n - r)!

In this case, n = 4 (the total number of people) and r = 3 (the number of people we want to draw and line up).

So, the number of ways to draw 3 people from 4 and put them in a line is:

4P3 = 4! / (4 - 3)!

Calculating the factorial:

4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24
(4 - 3)! = 1! = 1

Now, we calculate the permutation:

4P3 = 24 / 1 = 24

Therefore, there are 24 different ways to draw 3 people from the group of 4 and put them in a line.

Question: If there are 3 bus routes and 2 subway routes going from Seohee's house to school, find the number of ways to go by bus or subway.
Answer: To find the total number of ways Seohee can go to school by bus or subway, we simply add the number of bus routes to the number of subway routes.

Number of bus routes = 3
Number of subway routes = 2

Total number of ways = Number of bus routes + Number of subway routes
Total number of ways = 3 + 2
Total number of ways = 5

So, there are 5 different ways Seohee can go to school by bus or subway.

Question: Consider Taehyung can move 0.45 meters (m) in one step. If he moved 90 steps for 13 times, find the distance he walked in meters (m).
Answer: First, let's find the distance Taehyung walks in one set of 90 steps:

Distance for 90 steps = Number of steps × Distance per step
Distance for 90 steps = 90 steps × 0.45 m/step
Distance for 90 steps = 40.5 m

Now, let's find the total distance he walked after doing this 13 times:

Total distance = Distance for 90 steps × Number of times
Total distance = 40.5 m × 13
Total distance = 526.5 m

So, Taehyung walked a total of 526.5 meters.

Question: If the son's age is 1 year less than 1/4 of the father's age and the father's age is 5 years less than 5 times the son's age, how old is the son?
Answer: Let's denote the son's age as S and the father's age as F.

According to the first statement, the son's age is 1 year less than 1/4 of the father's age. This can be written as:
S = (1/4)F - 1 ...(1)

According to the second statement, the father's age is 5 years less than 5 times the son's age. This can be written as:
F = 5S - 5 ...(2)

Now, we can substitute the expression for F from equation (2) into equation (1) to solve for S:
S = (1/4)(5S - 5) - 1

Multiplying both sides by 4 to get rid of the fraction:
4S = 5S - 5 - 4

Now, let's move all terms involving S to one side and constants to the other side:
4S - 5S = -5 - 4

Combine like terms:
-S = -9

Now, divide both sides by -1 to solve for S:
S = 9

So, the son is 9 years old.

Question: There is a shape consisting of 8 angles of the same size. If the side of this figure is 12 centimeters (cm), how many centimeters (cm) is the perimeter?
Answer: If the shape has 8 angles of the same size and each side is 12 cm, it is an octagon (an 8-sided polygon) with equal sides. To find the perimeter of any polygon, you add up the lengths of all its sides.

Since all sides of the octagon are equal and each side is 12 cm, the perimeter P of the octagon can be calculated as:

P = number of sides × length of one side
P = 8 × 12 cm
P = 96 cm

So, the perimeter of the octagon is 96 cm.

Question: 282 is 133 greater than this number. What is the value if 11 is subtracted from this number?
Answer: Let's call the unknown number "x". According to the information given:

282 is 133 greater than x, so we can write the equation:
282 = x + 133

To find the value of x, we subtract 133 from both sides of the equation:
282 - 133 = x
149 = x

Now, we need to find the value if 11 is subtracted from x:
x - 11 = 149 - 11
x - 11 = 138

Therefore, the value is 138 when 11 is subtracted from the number x.

Question: There is a barrel with 10.4 kilograms (kg) of water. If you want to divide this water by 0.8 kg (kg) into each small bucket, how many buckets are needed?
Answer: To find out how many buckets are needed, you divide the total amount of water by the amount of water each bucket can hold.

Total amount of water = 10.4 kg
Amount of water per bucket = 0.8 kg

Number of buckets needed = Total amount of water / Amount of water per bucket
Number of buckets needed = 10.4 kg / 0.8 kg
Number of buckets needed = 13

So, you would need 13 buckets to divide 10.4 kg of water into 0.8 kg portions.

Question: The average height of the three people, A, B, and C is 143 centimeters (cm). If A's height is increased by 4.5 centimeters (cm), it becomes the average height of B and C. If B is 3 centimeters (cm) taller than C, how tall is C in centimeters (cm)?
Answer: Let's denote the heights of A, B, and C as \( h_A \), \( h_B \), and \( h_C \) respectively.

According to the information given:

1. The average height of A, B, and C is 143 cm:
\[ \frac{h_A + h_B + h_C}{3} = 143 \]
\[ h_A + h_B + h_C = 3 \times 143 \]
\[ h_A + h_B + h_C = 429 \] (Equation 1)

2. A's height increased by 4.5 cm becomes the average height of B and C:
\[ h_A + 4.5 = \frac{h_B + h_C}{2} \]
\[ 2h_A + 9 = h_B + h_C \] (Equation 2)

3. B is 3 cm taller than C:
\[ h_B = h_C + 3 \] (Equation 3)

Now, we can substitute \( h_B \) from Equation 3 into Equation 2:
\[ 2h_A + 9 = (h_C + 3) + h_C \]
\[ 2h_A + 9 = 2h_C + 3 \]
\[ 2h_A = 2h_C - 6 \]
\[ h_A = h_C - 3 \] (Equation 4)

Now, we can substitute \( h_A \) and \( h_B \) from Equations 4 and 3 into Equation 1:
\[ (h_C - 3) + (h_C + 3) + h_C = 429 \]
\[ 3h_C = 429 \]
\[ h_C = \frac{429}{3} \]
\[ h_C = 143 \]

Therefore, the height of C is 143 cm.

Question: You bought 60 centimeters (cm) of wire from a stationery store to make a square with a side length of 9 centimeters (cm). If you use this wire to make a square, how many centimeters (cm) of wire will you have left?
Answer: To make a square, you need 4 equal lengths of wire, one for each side of the square.

If each side of the square is 9 cm, then the total length of wire needed to make the square is:

4 sides * 9 cm/side = 36 cm

You started with 60 cm of wire, so if you use 36 cm to make the square, you will have:

60 cm - 36 cm = 24 cm

You will have 24 cm of wire left after making the square.

Question: There is a cube with a side perimeter of 52 centimeters (cm). What is the surface area of this cube in square centimeters (cm2)?
Answer: The side perimeter of a cube refers to the perimeter of one of its faces, which is a square. Since a square has four equal sides, we can find the length of one side of the cube by dividing the side perimeter by 4.

Side perimeter of the cube = 52 cm
Length of one side of the cube (s) = Side perimeter / 4
s = 52 cm / 4
s = 13 cm

The surface area (SA) of a cube is calculated by multiplying the area of one face by 6 (since a cube has 6 faces).

Area of one face = s^2
Area of one face = (13 cm)^2
Area of one face = 169 cm^2

Surface area of the cube = 6 * Area of one face
SA = 6 * 169 cm^2
SA = 1014 cm^2

Therefore, the surface area of the cube is 1014 square centimeters (cm^2).
Question: A is a number comprised of 1 group of 1000, 16 groups of 100, and 28 groups of 10. B is calculated as 3 jumps from 355 with an interval of 245. Find the value of A-B.
Answer: 1 group of 1000 = 1000
16 groups of 100 = 16 * 100 = 1600
28 groups of 10 = 28 * 10 = 280
A = 1000 + 1600 + 280
A = 2880

Question: How many kilograms (kg) are in 11 bricks if 5 bricks weigh 15.3 kilograms (kg)?
Answer: To find out how many kilograms are in 11 bricks, we first need to determine the weight of one brick. We can do this by dividing the total weight of the 5 bricks by the number of bricks:

15.3 kg / 5 bricks = 3.06 kg per brick

Now that we know the weight of one brick, we can calculate the weight of 11 bricks:

3.06 kg/brick * 11 bricks = 33.66 kg

Therefore, 11 bricks weigh 33.66 kilograms.

Question: I made the mistake of adding this number to 63, when I should have divided 36 by this number. The result of this miscalculation was 69. How much is it if I calculate it right?
Answer: Let's call the number you should have divided by "x".

According to your statement, you added x to 63 instead of dividing 36 by x, and the result was 69.

So the equation for the miscalculation is:
63 + x = 69

Now, solve for x:
x = 69 - 63
x = 6

Now that we know x is 6, we can calculate the correct operation, which is dividing 36 by 6:
36 ÷ 6 = 6

So the correct result is 6.

Question: (A) car travels at 60 kilometers (km) per hour and (B) car travels at 45 kilometers (km) per hour. If 5 hours have passed since starting from the same starting point, how many kilometers (km) is (A) car ahead of (B) car?
Answer: To find out how many kilometers car A is ahead of car B, we need to calculate the distance each car has traveled and then find the difference between those distances.

Distance is calculated by multiplying speed by time.

For car A:
Speed = 60 km/h
Time = 5 hours
Distance = Speed × Time = 60 km/h × 5 h = 300 km

For car B:
Speed = 45 km/h
Time = 5 hours
Distance = Speed × Time = 45 km/h × 5 h = 225 km

Now, we find the difference between the distances:
Distance A - Distance B = 300 km - 225 km = 75 km

Car A is 75 kilometers ahead of car B after 5 hours.
Question: A is 348 and A is less than B by 173. C is greater than B by 299. Find C.
Answer: 1. A = 348
2. A is less than B by 173, so B = A + 173 = 348 + 173 = 521
3. C is greater than B by 299, so C = B + 299 = 521 + 299

Question: If there are 3 bus routes and 2 subway routes going from Seohee's house to school, find the number of ways to go by bus or subway.
Answer: To find the total number of ways Seohee can go to school by bus or subway, we simply add the number of bus routes to the number of subway routes.

Number of bus routes = 3
Number of subway routes = 2

Total number of ways = Number of bus routes + Number of subway routes
Total number of ways = 3 + 2
Total number of ways = 5

So, there are 5 different ways Seohee can go to school by bus or subway.

Question: There are 5 different people. We are trying to select three of them to be the president, vice president, and manager. Find the number of cases.
Answer: To find the number of cases for selecting a president, vice president, and manager from 5 different people, we can use permutations since the order of selection matters (the roles are distinct).

The number of permutations of n distinct objects taken r at a time is given by the formula:

nPr = n! / (n - r)!

In this case, we have n = 5 (the number of people) and r = 3 (the number of positions to fill).

So, the number of cases is:

5P3 = 5! / (5 - 3)!
= 5! / 2!
= (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / (2 × 1)
= (5 × 4 × 3)
= 60

Therefore, there are 60 different cases for selecting a president, vice president, and manager from 5 different people.

Question: A regular polygon with a perimeter of 80 centimeters (cm) has a side length of 16 centimeters (cm). How many vertices are there in this regular polygon?
Answer: To find the number of vertices in a regular polygon, we can divide the perimeter by the length of one side.

Given that the perimeter is 80 cm and the side length is 16 cm, we can calculate the number of sides (and thus the number of vertices, since they are the same in a regular polygon) as follows:

Number of sides (vertices) = Perimeter / Side length
Number of sides (vertices) = 80 cm / 16 cm
Number of sides (vertices) = 5

Therefore, the regular polygon has 5 vertices.

Question: There are three bottles, A, B, and C, each with different sizes. 7 bottles of A and 3 bottles of B have the same capacity, and 1 bottle of B and 5 bottles of C are the same. How many bottles of C are equal to 21 bottles of A?
Answer: Let's denote the capacity of bottle A as \( a \), bottle B as \( b \), and bottle C as \( c \).

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. \( 7a = 3b \) (7 bottles of A have the same capacity as 3 bottles of B)
2. \( b = 5c \) (1 bottle of B has the same capacity as 5 bottles of C)

We want to find out how many bottles of C are equal to 21 bottles of A.

First, let's express \( b \) in terms of \( a \) using the first equation:

\[ 7a = 3b \]
\[ b = \frac{7a}{3} \]

Now, let's substitute \( b \) in the second equation with \( \frac{7a}{3} \):

\[ b = 5c \]
\[ \frac{7a}{3} = 5c \]

Now, we want to find the equivalent number of bottles of C for 21 bottles of A. Let's express 21 bottles of A in terms of \( c \):

\[ 21a = x \cdot c \]

We need to find \( x \), the number of bottles of C that are equivalent to 21 bottles of A. To do this, we can use the relationship we found between \( a \) and \( c \):

\[ \frac{7a}{3} = 5c \]
\[ a = \frac{15c}{7} \]

Now, substitute \( a \) in the equation for 21 bottles of A:

\[ 21 \cdot \frac{15c}{7} = x \cdot c \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 3 \cdot 15c = x \cdot c \]
\[ 45c = x \cdot c \]

Now, divide both sides by \( c \) to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 45 \]

Therefore, 21 bottles of A are equal to 45 bottles of C.

Question: Among the natural numbers from 1 to 100, what is the third largest number with a remainder of 2 when divided by 5?
Answer: To find the natural numbers with a remainder of 2 when divided by 5, we look for numbers that are of the form 5n + 2, where n is a non-negative integer.

Starting from the largest number less than 100 that satisfies this condition, we have:

98 = 5 * 19 + 3 (remainder is not 2)
97 = 5 * 19 + 2 (remainder is 2, so this is the largest number with a remainder of 2)
96 = 5 * 19 + 1 (remainder is not 2)
95 = 5 * 19 (remainder is 0)
94 = 5 * 18 + 4 (remainder is not 2)
93 = 5 * 18 + 3 (remainder is not 2)
92 = 5 * 18 + 2 (remainder is 2, so this is the second largest number with a remainder of 2)
91 = 5 * 18 + 1 (remainder is not 2)
90 = 5 * 18 (remainder is 0)
89 = 5 * 17 + 4 (remainder is not 2)
88 = 5 * 17 + 3 (remainder is not 2)
87 = 5 * 17 + 2 (remainder is 2, so this is the third largest number with a remainder of 2)

Therefore, the third largest number with a remainder of 2 when divided by 5 among the natural numbers from 1 to 100 is 87.

Question: Multiplying a number by 13 and subtracting 272 gives you 105. Find the number.
Answer: Let's call the number you're looking for "x". According to the problem, if you multiply this number by 13 and then subtract 272, you get 105. We can write this as an equation:

13x - 272 = 105

To find the number, we need to solve for x. First, we'll add 272 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with x on one side:

13x - 272 + 272 = 105 + 272
13x = 377

Now, we'll divide both sides by 13 to solve for x:

13x / 13 = 377 / 13
x = 29

So the number you're looking for is 29.

Question: There are a total of 24 students in Year 1 and Year 2. Of these, 50 chocolates were distributed equally to only the first-year students, and two chocolates were left. If the number of second-year students is twice the number of first-year students, how many chocolates did the first-year students get?
Answer: Let's denote the number of first-year students as F and the number of second-year students as S.

According to the problem, the number of second-year students is twice the number of first-year students, so we can write this as:
S = 2F

We also know that there are a total of 24 students in Year 1 and Year 2 combined, so we can write this as:
F + S = 24

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
F + 2F = 24
3F = 24
F = 24 / 3
F = 8

So there are 8 first-year students.

Now, we know that 50 chocolates were distributed equally among the first-year students, and two were left. This means that the number of chocolates that can be distributed equally among the first-year students is 50 - 2 = 48 chocolates.

Since there are 8 first-year students, we can divide the 48 chocolates equally among them:
48 chocolates / 8 students = 6 chocolates per first-year student

Therefore, each first-year student got 6 chocolates.

Answer: To find the total number of chips, you can multiply the number of rows with the number of chips in each row and then add the row with a different number of chips.

For the 9 rows with 8 chips each:
9 rows * 8 chips/row = 72 chips

For the 1 row with 4 chips:
1 row * 4 chips/row = 4 chips

Now, add the two amounts together:

Question: In art class, Miyoung is going to cut a rectangular colored paper measuring 32 centimeters (cm) wide by 74 centimeters (cm) long to make several identical squares without any left over. What is the size of one side of the largest square that Miyoung can make?
Answer: To find the size of the largest square Miyoung can make from the rectangular paper without any leftover, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two sides of the rectangle. The GCD will give us the largest length that can evenly divide both the width and the length of the rectangle.

The width of the paper is 32 cm, and the length is 74 cm. Let's find the GCD of 32 and 74.

We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD:

1. Divide the larger number by the smaller number and find the remainder.
2. Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder from step 1.
3. Repeat the process until the remainder is 0. The non-zero remainder just before this is the GCD.

Let's apply this to our numbers:

74 ÷ 32 = 2 with a remainder of 10.
32 ÷ 10 = 3 with a remainder of 2.
10 ÷ 2 = 5 with a remainder of 0.

So, the GCD of 32 and 74 is 2 cm.

Therefore, the largest square Miyoung can make from the rectangular paper without any leftover will have sides of 2 cm each.

Question: There are two natural numbers A and B. When A is divided by B, the quotient is 28 and the remainder is 4. Find A when A is the smallest in this equation.
Answer: Let's denote A as the dividend and B as the divisor. According to the division algorithm, when a number A is divided by another number B, it can be expressed as:

A = B * Q + R

where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder.

From the given information, we have:
Q = 28 (the quotient when A is divided by B)
R = 4 (the remainder when A is divided by B)

We want to find the smallest possible value of A that satisfies this equation. Since we are looking for the smallest A, we should consider the smallest possible value of B that still gives a remainder of 4 when A is divided by it. The smallest B can be is 1 (since B is a natural number and natural numbers start from 1), but that would not give us a remainder of 4. The next smallest B would be 5, which would give us a remainder of 4 when A is divided by it (since 5 - 1 = 4).

So, let's try B = 5 and see if it satisfies the equation:

A = B * Q + R
A = 5 * 28 + 4
A = 140 + 4
A = 144

Therefore, the smallest possible value of A that satisfies the given conditions is 144.

Question: Jinwoo and Seongmin can do 7/12 of the work if they do something for 8 days together. The two of them did this together for 8 days, and the rest was done by Jinwoo alone for 10 days. How many days will it take if Seongmin finishes this task by himself from the beginning?
Answer: Let's denote the total work by W.

According to the information given, Jinwoo and Seongmin together can do 7/12 of the work in 8 days. This means that in one day, they can do (7/12) / 8 of the work. Let's call this rate of work R1.

R1 = (7/12) / 8

Now, Jinwoo alone finishes the remaining work in 10 days. The remaining work is 5/12 of the total work (since 7/12 has been completed). Let's denote Jinwoo's rate of work as Rj.

Rj = (5/12) / 10

We want to find out how many days it will take Seongmin to finish the entire work by himself. Let's denote Seongmin's rate of work as Rs and the number of days it would take him to finish the work as Ds.

Since Jinwoo and Seongmin together have a combined rate of R1, we can express this as:

R1 = Rj + Rs

We already have R1 and Rj, so we can solve for Rs:

Rs = R1 - Rj

Now, we can find Ds by dividing the total work W by Rs:

Ds = W / Rs

Let's calculate R1 and Rj first:

R1 = (7/12) / 8 = 7/96 (work per day)

Rj = (5/12) / 10 = 1/24 (work per day)

Now, we can find Rs:

Rs = R1 - Rj
Rs = 7/96 - 1/24
Rs = 7/96 - 4/96
Rs = 3/96
Rs = 1/32 (work per day)

Finally, we can find Ds:

Ds = W / Rs
Ds = 1 / (1/32)
Ds = 32 days

So, it will take Seongmin 32 days to finish the task by himself.

Question: Subtracting 46 from a number gives 15 as a result. What would be the result if 29 is subtracted from this number?
Answer: Let's call the unknown number "x".

According to the first statement, subtracting 46 from x gives 15:
x - 46 = 15

To find the value of x, we add 46 to both sides of the equation:
x - 46 + 46 = 15 + 46
x = 61

Now, we want to know the result if 29 is subtracted from this number (x = 61):
61 - 29 = 32

So, the result would be 32.

Question: The sum of the weights of the bags of 10 people traveling together on a European tour is divided by 42, there is no rest, and the quotient is 10. Suji, one of the party, bought a souvenir and the bag weighed 50 kg (kg). If the average weight of the bags is 44 kilograms (kg), how many kilograms (kg) does the Suji bag weigh before buying the souvenir?
Answer: Let's start by finding the total weight of the bags of the 10 people before Suji bought the souvenir. We know that the average weight of the bags is 44 kg, so the total weight of the bags is:

Total weight = Average weight × Number of people
Total weight = 44 kg/person × 10 people
Total weight = 440 kg

Now, we are told that when the sum of the weights of the bags is divided by 42, the quotient is 10 and there is no remainder. This means that the total weight of the bags is a multiple of 42, and that multiple is 10. So the total weight of the bags is:

Total weight = Quotient × Divisor
Total weight = 10 × 42
Total weight = 420 kg

There seems to be a discrepancy here because the total weight we calculated using the average (440 kg) is not the same as the total weight that is a multiple of 42 (420 kg). Let's assume that the total weight that is a multiple of 42 is the correct total weight of the bags before Suji bought the souvenir.

Now, after Suji bought the souvenir, her bag weighed 50 kg. We need to find out how much her bag weighed before that. Since the total weight of the bags before the souvenir was 420 kg, and the total weight after the souvenir is 440 kg (because the average weight of 44 kg for 10 people gives us 440 kg), the difference must be the weight of the souvenir.

Weight of the souvenir = Total weight after souvenir - Total weight before souvenir
Weight of the souvenir = 440 kg - 420 kg
Weight of the souvenir = 20 kg

So, the souvenir Suji bought weighed 20 kg. Now we can find out how much her bag weighed before she bought the souvenir:

Weight of Suji's bag before souvenir = Weight of Suji's bag after souvenir - Weight of the souvenir
Weight of Suji's bag before souvenir = 50 kg - 20 kg
Weight of Suji's bag before souvenir = 30 kg

Therefore, Suji's bag weighed 30 kg before she bought the souvenir.

Question: Tigers are said to run 3.8 kilometers (km) per hour. How many kilometers (km) could the tiger run without stopping in 2 hours and 45 minutes?
Answer: To calculate the distance a tiger could run without stopping in 2 hours and 45 minutes, we first need to convert the time into hours since the speed is given in kilometers per hour (km/h).

2 hours and 45 minutes is equivalent to 2 hours + (45 minutes / 60 minutes per hour) = 2 + 0.75 hours = 2.75 hours.

Now, we can use the speed of the tiger to calculate the distance:

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 3.8 km/h × 2.75 hours

Distance = 10.45 km

So, the tiger could run 10.45 kilometers without stopping in 2 hours and 45 minutes.

Question: Find the number of common multiples of 16 and 24 that are no more than 200.
Answer: To find the common multiples of 16 and 24, we first need to find their least common multiple (LCM). The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both numbers.

The prime factorization of 16 is 2^4.
The prime factorization of 24 is 2^3 * 3.

To find the LCM, we take the highest powers of the prime factors from each number:
LCM = 2^4 * 3 = 16 * 3 = 48.

Now we need to find all the multiples of 48 that are no more than 200. We do this by dividing 200 by 48:

200 ÷ 48 = 4 with a remainder.

This means that there are 4 multiples of 48 up to 200 (since we only consider whole numbers). To list them out:

1st multiple: 48 * 1 = 48
2nd multiple: 48 * 2 = 96
3rd multiple: 48 * 3 = 144
4th multiple: 48 * 4 = 192

There are no more multiples of 48 up to 200 because the next multiple, 48 * 5 = 240, is greater than 200.

Therefore, there are 4 common multiples of 16 and 24 that are no more than 200.

Question: You have a square piece of paper with a side length of 10 centimeters (cm). How many right triangle-shaped pieces with a base of 1 centimeter (cm) and a hight of 3 centimeters (cm) can you cut out from this piece of paper?
Answer: To determine how many right triangle-shaped pieces with a base of 1 cm and a height of 3 cm can be cut out from a square piece of paper with a side length of 10 cm, we need to calculate the area of the square and the area of one of the right triangles, and then divide the area of the square by the area of the triangle.

The area of the square (A_square) is given by the formula:
A_square = side_length^2
A_square = 10 cm * 10 cm
A_square = 100 cm^2

The area of the right triangle (A_triangle) is given by the formula:
A_triangle = (base * height) / 2
A_triangle = (1 cm * 3 cm) / 2
A_triangle = 3 cm^2 / 2
A_triangle = 1.5 cm^2

Now, we divide the area of the square by the area of the triangle to find out how many triangles can fit in the square:
Number of triangles = A_square / A_triangle
Number of triangles = 100 cm^2 / 1.5 cm^2
Number of triangles = 66.66...

Since we cannot have a fraction of a triangle, we can only cut out 66 whole right triangle-shaped pieces from the square piece of paper.

Question: 3 bottles of 0.2 liters (L) of milk are delivered to Minjeong's house every day. Find how many liters (L) of all the milk was delivered to Minjeong's house for a week.
Answer: To find the total amount of milk delivered to Minjeong's house for a week, we need to multiply the daily delivery amount by the number of days in a week.

Each day, 3 bottles of 0.2 liters of milk are delivered. So, the daily delivery amount is:
3 bottles/day * 0.2 liters/bottle = 0.6 liters/day

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of milk delivered in a week is:
0.6 liters/day * 7 days/week = 4.2 liters/week

Therefore, 4.2 liters of milk were delivered to Minjeong's house for a week.

Question: There is an octagon-shaped gift box. If the box's perimeter is 72 centimeters (cm), what is the side length in centimeters (cm)?
Answer: An octagon has eight equal sides. To find the length of one side, we can divide the total perimeter by the number of sides.

Given the perimeter is 72 cm, we divide this by 8 (the number of sides in an octagon):

72 cm ÷ 8 = 9 cm

So, the length of one side of the octagon-shaped gift box is 9 cm.

Question: Yesterday, Eunji's uncle gave Eunji some pocket money. Eunji bought a notebook with half of her pocket money, and when she received an additional 550 won from her mother today, her money became 1,000 won. How much money did she get from her uncle?
Answer: Let's denote the amount of pocket money Eunji received from her uncle as X won.

According to the information given, Eunji spent half of her pocket money on a notebook. So, she spent X/2 won on the notebook.

After buying the notebook, she had X/2 won left.

Today, Eunji's mother gave her an additional 550 won. So, the money she had after receiving the additional amount is (X/2 + 550 won).

We are told that after receiving the additional 550 won, Eunji has a total of 1,000 won. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

X/2 + 550 won = 1,000 won

Now, let's solve for X:

X/2 = 1,000 won - 550 won
X/2 = 450 won

To find the total amount Eunji received from her uncle, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

X = 450 won * 2
X = 900 won

Therefore, Eunji received 900 won from her uncle.

Question: If the area of a piece of paper in the shape of a rhombus is 80 square centimeters (cm2) and one diagonal is 16 centimeters (cm), how long is the other diagonal in centimeters (cm)?
Answer: The area of a rhombus can be calculated using the formula:

Area = (d1 * d2) / 2

where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals.

We are given that the area is 80 cm² and one diagonal (d1) is 16 cm. We can use this information to solve for the other diagonal (d2):

80 = (16 * d2) / 2

To find d2, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

160 = 16 * d2

Now, divide both sides by 16 to solve for d2:

d2 = 160 / 16
d2 = 10 cm

So, the length of the other diagonal is 10 cm.

Question: There are 247 first-year students at Junseo's school, and 131 more sophomores than first-year students. If you are going to distribute one loaf to each first grader and second grader, how many loaves do you need to prepare in total?
Answer: To find out the total number of loaves needed, we first need to determine the number of sophomores at Junseo's school. Since there are 131 more sophomores than first-year students, we can calculate the number of sophomores as follows:

Number of sophomores = Number of first-year students + 131
Number of sophomores = 247 + 131
Number of sophomores = 378

Now, to find the total number of loaves needed, we add the number of first-year students to the number of sophomores:

Total number of loaves = Number of first-year students + Number of sophomores
Total number of loaves = 247 + 378
Total number of loaves = 625

Therefore, you need to prepare 625 loaves in total.

Question: The sum of the weights of the bags of 10 people traveling together on a European tour is divided by 42, there is no rest, and the quotient is 10. Suji, one of the party, bought a souvenir and the bag weighed 50 kg (kg). If the average weight of the bags is 44 kilograms (kg), how many kilograms (kg) does the Suji bag weigh before buying the souvenir?
Answer: Let's start by finding the total weight of the bags of the 10 people before Suji bought the souvenir. We know that the average weight of the bags is 44 kg, so the total weight of the bags is:

Total weight = Average weight × Number of people
Total weight = 44 kg/person × 10 people
Total weight = 440 kg

Now, we are told that when the sum of the weights of the bags is divided by 42, the quotient is 10 and there is no remainder. This means that the total weight of the bags is a multiple of 42, and that multiple is 10. So the total weight of the bags is:

Total weight = Quotient × Divisor
Total weight = 10 × 42
Total weight = 420 kg

There seems to be a discrepancy here because the total weight we calculated using the average (440 kg) is not the same as the total weight that is a multiple of 42 (420 kg). Let's assume that the total weight that is a multiple of 42 is the correct total weight of the bags before Suji bought the souvenir.

Now, after Suji bought the souvenir, her bag weighed 50 kg. We need to find out how much her bag weighed before that. Since the total weight of the bags before the souvenir was 420 kg, and the total weight after the souvenir is 440 kg (because the average weight of 44 kg for 10 people gives us 440 kg), the difference must be the weight of the souvenir.

Weight of the souvenir = Total weight after souvenir - Total weight before souvenir
Weight of the souvenir = 440 kg - 420 kg
Weight of the souvenir = 20 kg

So, the souvenir Suji bought weighed 20 kg. Now we can find out how much her bag weighed before she bought the souvenir:

Weight of Suji's bag before souvenir = Weight of Suji's bag after souvenir - Weight of the souvenir
Weight of Suji's bag before souvenir = 50 kg - 20 kg
Weight of Suji's bag before souvenir = 30 kg

Therefore, Suji's bag weighed 30 kg before she bought the souvenir.

Question: A prism has 24 vertices, and all edges are 5 centimeters (cm) long. What is the sum of the lengths of all the edges of this prism in centimeters (cm)?
Answer: To find the sum of the lengths of all the edges of the prism, we need to know how many edges the prism has. Since the prism has 24 vertices, we can deduce that it is not a standard prism (like a triangular prism or a rectangular prism) because those have fewer vertices.

However, we can use the Euler's formula for polyhedra to find the number of edges (E). Euler's formula states that for any convex polyhedron (which includes prisms), the number of vertices (V), the number of edges (E), and the number of faces (F) are related by the following formula:

V - E + F = 2

We know V = 24 (the number of vertices). We need to find E (the number of edges). We don't know F (the number of faces), but we can deduce it if we know the shape of the prism. Since we don't have that information, we cannot directly use Euler's formula to find the number of edges.

However, if we assume that the prism is a regular polyhedron (which is not stated but could be a reasonable assumption given the uniform edge length), the only regular polyhedron with 24 vertices is the truncated octahedron, which is an Archimedean solid, not a prism. The truncated octahedron has 36 edges.

If we assume that the prism is a truncated octahedron, then the sum of the lengths of all the edges would be:

Sum of edge lengths = Number of edges × Length of each edge
Sum of edge lengths = 36 edges × 5 cm/edge
Sum of edge lengths = 180 cm

So, if the prism is a truncated octahedron, the sum of the lengths of all the edges would be 180 cm. However, without more specific information about the shape of the prism, we cannot definitively determine the sum of the lengths of all the edges.

Question: I mistakenly subtracted a number that should be multiplied by 423, and I got 421. Find the value of subtracting 500 from the sum of the correctly calculated and incorrectly calculated values.
Answer: Let's call the number that should have been multiplied by 423 as "x".

The incorrect calculation was a subtraction, and you got 421. So the incorrect calculation is:
423 - x = 421

To find the correct calculation, we need to multiply 423 by x:
423 * x

Now, we need to solve for x in the incorrect calculation:
423 - x = 421
x = 423 - 421
x = 2

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the correctly calculated value:
423 * x = 423 * 2 = 846

Now we have both the incorrectly calculated value (421) and the correctly calculated value (846). We need to find the sum of these two values and then subtract 500:
Sum = 421 + 846 = 1267

Subtracting 500 from the sum:
1267 - 500 = 767

So the value of subtracting 500 from the sum of the correctly calculated and incorrectly calculated values is 767.

x = 36 / 9

x = 4

So the number is exactly 4.

Question: Subtracting 10 from a number yields 15. How much do you get if you add 5 to this number?
Answer: Let's call the original number "x". According to the first statement, subtracting 10 from x gives us 15:

x - 10 = 15

To find the value of x, we add 10 to both sides of the equation:

x - 10 + 10 = 15 + 10
x = 25

Now, if we add 5 to this number (x), we get:

25 + 5 = 30

So, if you add 5 to the original number, you get 30.
Question: Taehyung is trying to divide 21/11 liters (L) of water into 7/11 liters (L) per cup, and Hoseok is trying to divide 8/17 liters (L) of water into 2/17 liters (L) per cup. How many cups will Taehyung and Hoseok need in order to divide all the water they each have into the cups?
Answer: 1. Taehyung has 21/11 liters of water. To find how many cups he needs, we can divide 21/11 by 7/11:

(21/11) ÷ (7/11) = 21/11 ×

Question: How many cases can you make a number that is 10 or more and 100 or less by selecting two cards from 1, 7, and 9?
Answer: To make a number that is 10 or more and 100 or less by selecting two cards from 1, 7, and 9, we can form two-digit numbers by placing one card in the tens place and the other in the ones place. We can't use the same card twice since we only have one of each card.

Here are the possible combinations:

1. 17 (1 in the tens place and 7 in the ones place)
2. 71 (7 in the tens place and 1 in the ones place)
3. 19 (1 in the tens place and 9 in the ones place)
4. 91 (9 in the tens place and 1 in the ones place)
5. 79 (7 in the tens place and 9 in the ones place)
6. 97 (9 in the tens place and 7 in the ones place)

All of these numbers are between 10 and 100. Therefore, there are 6 cases where you can make a number that is 10 or more and 100 or less by selecting two cards from 1, 7, and 9.
Question: You have a square with a perimeter of 17.8 centimeters (cm). How many centimeters (cm) is one side of this figure?
Answer: 17.8 cm is the perimeter of the square. The perimeter of a square is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. Since all sides of a square are equal, the perimeter is equal to the number of sides multiplied by the length of one side. In this case, the

Question: You have a rectangle with a perimeter of 48 centimeters (cm). If the length of this rectangle is 2 centimeters (cm) longer than its width, how long is its width in centimeters (cm)?
Answer: Let's denote the width of the rectangle as \( w \) cm and the length as \( l \) cm. According to the problem, the length is 2 cm longer than the width, so we can express the length as \( l = w + 2 \) cm.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula \( P = 2l + 2w \). We know the perimeter is 48 cm, so we can set up the equation:

\[ 48 = 2(w + 2) + 2w \]

Now, let's solve for \( w \):

\[ 48 = 2w + 4 + 2w \]
\[ 48 = 4w + 4 \]
\[ 48 - 4 = 4w \]
\[ 44 = 4w \]
\[ w = \frac{44}{4} \]
\[ w = 11 \]

So, the width of the rectangle is 11 cm.
Question: Eunbi and Jaeyeon practiced running every day for five days. If Eunbi ran a total of 4.3 kilometers (km) for 5 days and Jaeyeon ran 900 meters (m) every day, find out who would have run more.
Answer: 900 meters is equal to 0.9 kilometers. So, Jaeyeon ran 0.9 km every day. For 5 days, she ran a total of:

\[ 0.9 \times 5 = 4.5 \]
