Question: Jimin's school uses 7000 liters (l) of water per day. Find how many days it will take for the water used at Jimin's school to reach 100000 liters (l).
Answer: To find out how many days it will take for the water used at Jimin's school to reach 100,000 liters, we need to divide the total amount of water to be used by the amount of water used per day.

Total amount of water to be used: 100,000 liters
Amount of water used per day: 7,000 liters

Number of days = Total amount of water to be used / Amount of water used per day
Number of days = 100,000 liters / 7,000 liters per day
Number of days = 14.2857 days

Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we'll round up to the nearest whole day. Therefore, it will take 15 days for the water used at Jimin's school to reach 100,000 liters.
Question: Using the four digits 1, 5, 6, and 9 once, find the largest three-digit number with hundreds digit of 1.
Answer: To find the largest three-digit number with the hundreds digit of 1, we need to arrange the remaining digits (5, 6, and 9) in descending order for the tens and units places.

So, the largest digit among 5, 6, and 9 is 9, which we will place in the tens place. The next largest digit is 6, which we will place in the units place.

Therefore, the largest three-digit number with the hundreds digit of 1 is 196.

Question: There are fifteen pieces of square-shaped colored paper with a side length of 25 centimeters (cm) glued together. Given that they were overlapped by 0.5 centimeters (cm) to connect them having a maximum length of one side of the paper, find its length in meters (m).
Answer: To find the total length of the paper, we need to consider the overlap between each piece of paper. Since each piece of paper is 25 cm in length and they overlap by 0.5 cm, the effective length added by each additional piece of paper is 25 cm - 0.5 cm.

For the first piece of paper, we have the full length of 25 cm. For each subsequent piece, we add 24.5 cm (since 0.5 cm is overlapped).

With 15 pieces of paper, we have one full piece and 14 additional pieces that contribute an effective length of 24.5 cm each.

The total length in centimeters is:
25 cm + (14 * 24.5 cm)

Now, let's calculate that:
25 cm + (14 * 24.5 cm) = 25 cm + 343 cm
Total length = 368 cm

To convert centimeters to meters, we divide by 100 (since 1 meter = 100 centimeters).

Total length in meters = 368 cm / 100
Total length in meters = 3.68 m

So, the length of the paper in meters is 3.68 m.
Question: There are boxes A, B, C, and D with different weights. Box B is heavier than Box C, and Box A is lighter than Box C. If box D is heavier than B, which box is the heaviest?
Answer: Box D is the heaviest because it is heavier than Box B, which is heavier than Box C, and Box A is lighter than Box C. Therefore, the order from heaviest to lightest is D > B > C > A, making Box D the heaviest.
Question: Jiwon went to a snack bar with his friends. There are 4 friends, including Jiwon, and they want to buy 5 fish cakes at 200 won each and 7 servings of tteokbokki at 800 won each. How much does one person have to pay if all of his friends pay the same?
Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the fish cakes and tteokbokki.

The cost of 5 fish cakes at 200 won each is:
5 fish cakes * 200 won/fish cake = 1000 won

The cost of 7 servings of tteokbokki at 800 won each is:
7 servings * 800 won/serving = 5600 won

Now, let's add the cost of the fish cakes and tteokbokki to get the total cost:
Total cost = Cost of fish cakes + Cost of tteokbokki
Total cost = 1000 won + 5600 won
Total cost = 6600 won

Since there are 4 friends, including Jiwon, we need to divide the total cost by 4 to find out how much each person has to pay:
Total cost per person = Total cost / Number of friends
Total cost per person = 6600 won / 4
Total cost per person = 1650 won

So, each person has to pay 1650 won.

Question: There are three bottles, A, B, and C, each with different sizes. 7 bottles of A and 3 bottles of B have the same capacity, and 1 bottle of B and 5 bottles of C are the same. How many bottles of C are equal to 21 bottles of A?
Answer: Let's denote the capacity of bottle A as \( a \), bottle B as \( b \), and bottle C as \( c \).

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. \( 7a = 3b \) (7 bottles of A have the same capacity as 3 bottles of B)
2. \( b = 5c \) (1 bottle of B has the same capacity as 5 bottles of C)

We want to find out how many bottles of C are equal to 21 bottles of A.

First, let's express \( b \) in terms of \( a \) using the first equation:

\[ 7a = 3b \]
\[ b = \frac{7a}{3} \]

Now, let's substitute \( b \) in the second equation with \( \frac{7a}{3} \):

\[ b = 5c \]
\[ \frac{7a}{3} = 5c \]

Now, we want to find the equivalent number of bottles of C for 21 bottles of A. Let's express 21 bottles of A in terms of \( c \):

\[ 21a = x \cdot c \]

We need to find \( x \), the number of bottles of C that are equivalent to 21 bottles of A. To do this, we can use the relationship we found between \( a \) and \( c \):

\[ \frac{7a}{3} = 5c \]
\[ a = \frac{15c}{7} \]

Now, substitute \( a \) in the equation for 21 bottles of A:

\[ 21 \cdot \frac{15c}{7} = x \cdot c \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 3 \cdot 15c = x \cdot c \]
\[ 45c = x \cdot c \]

Now, divide both sides by \( c \) to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 45 \]

Therefore, 21 bottles of A are equal to 45 bottles of C.
Question: There are 3 apples and 2 persimmons in the box. How many persimmons are in the box?
Answer: There are 2 persimmons in the box.
Question: You have a rectangular garden. The garden is 500 centimeters (cm) wide and 800 centimeters (cm) long. What is the area of this garden in square meters (m2)?
Answer: To find the area of the garden in square meters, we first need to calculate the area in square centimeters and then convert it to square meters.

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:
Area = Length × Width

Given that the length is 800 cm and the width is 500 cm, the area in square centimeters is:
Area = 800 cm × 500 cm
Area = 400,000 cm²

Now, to convert square centimeters to square meters, we need to know that 1 square meter is equal to 10,000 square centimeters (since 1 meter is 100 centimeters, and area is two-dimensional, we square the conversion factor: 100 cm × 100 cm = 10,000 cm²).

So, to convert the area from cm² to m², we divide by 10,000:
Area in m² = Area in cm² / 10,000
Area in m² = 400,000 cm² / 10,000
Area in m² = 40 m²

Therefore, the area of the garden is 40 square meters (m²).

Question: The conch-shaped bread is 250 grams (g) and I made two boxes with 12 each. The Red-bean bread is 200 grams (g) and is made into three boxes with 16 each. Which bread is in the box that weighs more than other boxes?
Answer: First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of bread per box.

For the conch-shaped bread:
Each bread weighs 250 grams and there are 12 in a box, so:
250 grams/bread * 12 breads/box = 3000 grams/box

For the Red-bean bread:
Each bread weighs 200 grams and there are 16 in a box, so:
200 grams/bread * 16 breads/box = 3200 grams/box

Comparing the two:
- A box of conch-shaped bread weighs 3000 grams.
- A box of Red-bean bread weighs 3200 grams.

The box with the Red-bean bread weighs more than the box with the conch-shaped bread.
Question: Tigers are said to run 3.8 kilometers (km) per hour. How many kilometers (km) could the tiger run without stopping in 2 hours and 45 minutes?
Answer: To calculate the distance a tiger could run without stopping in 2 hours and 45 minutes, we first need to convert the time into hours since the speed is given in kilometers per hour (km/h).

2 hours and 45 minutes is equivalent to 2 hours + (45 minutes / 60 minutes per hour) = 2 + 0.75 hours = 2.75 hours.

Now, we can use the speed of the tiger to calculate the distance:

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 3.8 km/h × 2.75 hours

Distance = 10.45 km

So, the tiger could run 10.45 kilometers without stopping in 2 hours and 45 minutes.
Question: There is a box with a width of 24 centimeters (cm), a length of 15 centimeters (cm), and a height of 28 centimeters (cm). If you fill this box with as many milk cartons as possible, with a width of 4 centimeters (cm), a length of 5 centimeters (cm), and a height of 7 centimeters (cm), how many milk cartons will it fit?
Answer: To determine how many milk cartons can fit in the box, we need to calculate the volume of both the box and a single milk carton and then divide the volume of the box by the volume of a milk carton.

The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (like the box and the milk carton) can be calculated using the formula:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

First, let's calculate the volume of the box:
\[ V_{\text{box}} = 24 \text{ cm (width)} \times 15 \text{ cm (length)} \times 28 \text{ cm (height)} \]
\[ V_{\text{box}} = 24 \times 15 \times 28 \]
\[ V_{\text{box}} = 360 \times 28 \]
\[ V_{\text{box}} = 10080 \text{ cm}^3 \]

Now, let's calculate the volume of a single milk carton:
\[ V_{\text{milk carton}} = 4 \text{ cm (width)} \times 5 \text{ cm (length)} \times 7 \text{ cm (height)} \]
\[ V_{\text{milk carton}} = 4 \times 5 \times 7 \]
\[ V_{\text{milk carton}} = 20 \times 7 \]
\[ V_{\text{milk carton}} = 140 \text{ cm}^3 \]

To find out how many milk cartons can fit in the box, we divide the volume of the box by the volume of a single milk carton:
\[ \text{Number of milk cartons} = \frac{V_{\text{box}}}{V_{\text{milk carton}}} \]
\[ \text{Number of milk cartons} = \frac{10080}{140} \]
\[ \text{Number of milk cartons} = 72 \]

Therefore, 72 milk cartons can fit in the box.

16 - 8 = 8 pencils.
Question: There is a cube with a side perimeter of 52 centimeters (cm). What is the surface area of this cube in square centimeters (cm2)?
Answer: The side perimeter of a cube refers to the perimeter of one of its faces, which is a square. Since a square has four equal sides, we can find the length of one side of the cube by dividing the side perimeter by 4.

Side perimeter of the cube = 52 cm
Length of one side of the cube (s) = Side perimeter / 4
s = 52 cm / 4
s = 13 cm

The surface area (SA) of a cube is calculated by multiplying the area of one face by 6 (since a cube has 6 faces).

Area of one face = s^2
Area of one face = (13 cm)^2
Area of one face = 169 cm^2

Surface area of the cube = 6 * Area of one face
SA = 6 * 169 cm^2
SA = 1014 cm^2

Therefore, the surface area of the cube is 1014 square centimeters (cm^2).

Question: There are 56 tulips. Red tulips are 3/7 of the total. Blue tulips are 3/8 of the total. If the rest are pink tulips, how many pink tulips are there?
Answer: First, let's find out how many red tulips there are. Since red tulips are 3/7 of the total, we can calculate the number of red tulips by multiplying the total number of tulips by 3/7:

Number of red tulips = (3/7) * 56

Now, let's find out how many blue tulips there are. Since blue tulips are 3/8 of the total, we can calculate the number of blue tulips by multiplying the total number of tulips by 3/8:

Number of blue tulips = (3/8) * 56

Finally, to find out how many pink tulips there are, we subtract the number of red and blue tulips from the total number of tulips:

Number of pink tulips = Total tulips - (Number of red tulips + Number of blue tulips)

Let's do the calculations:

Number of red tulips = (3/7) * 56 = 3 * 8 = 24
Number of blue tulips = (3/8) * 56 = 3 * 7 = 21

Number of pink tulips = 56 - (24 + 21) = 56 - 45 = 11

So, there are 11 pink tulips.
Question: The TV license fee is 30 won per 10 seconds. If Mingyu watched TV for 2 minutes and 40 seconds, how much would the license fee be?
Answer: First, we need to convert the time Mingyu watched TV into seconds. 

2 minutes and 40 seconds is equal to (2 * 60) + 40 seconds, which is 120 + 40 seconds, totaling 160 seconds.

Now, we know the TV license fee is 30 won per 10 seconds. To find out how many 10-second intervals are in 160 seconds, we divide 160 by 10, which gives us 16 intervals.

Finally, we multiply the number of intervals by the fee per interval to find the total cost:

16 intervals * 30 won per interval = 480 won

So, the license fee for watching TV for 2 minutes and 40 seconds would be 480 won.
Question: A small square is made by dividing a square with a side of 20 centimeters (cm) into thirds. Find the area of the newly created small square in square centimeters (cm2), rounded to two decimal places.
Answer: To find the area of the newly created small square, we first need to determine the side length of the small square.

Since the original square with a side of 20 cm is divided into thirds, each third will have a side length of \( \frac{20}{3} \) cm.

The area of a square is found by squaring the side length. So, the area of the small square is:

\( \left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 \) cm²

\( = \frac{400}{9} \) cm²

\( = 44.44 \) cm² (rounded to two decimal places)

So, the area of the newly created small square is 44.44 cm².

Question: Find the sum of odd numbers from 100 to 200.
Answer: To find the sum of odd numbers from 100 to 200, we first need to identify the first and last odd numbers in this range.

The first odd number after 100 is 101, and the last odd number before 200 is 199.

Now, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

Sum = n/2 * (first term + last term)

where n is the number of terms.

To find n, we can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:

last term = first term + (n - 1) * common difference

Here, the common difference is 2 (since we are looking at odd numbers, which are 2 units apart).

199 = 101 + (n - 1) * 2

Solving for n:

199 = 101 + 2n - 2
199 = 99 + 2n
100 = 2n
n = 50

So, there are 50 odd numbers between 100 and 200.

Now, we can find the sum:

Sum = 50/2 * (101 + 199)
Sum = 25 * (300)
Sum = 7500

Therefore, the sum of odd numbers from 100 to 200 is 7500.
Question: Find the number of numbers less than 0.4 among 0.8, 1/2, 0.3, and 1/3.
Answer: To find the number of numbers less than 0.4 among the given numbers, we need to compare each number to 0.4.

The given numbers are:
0.8, 1/2, 0.3, and 1/3.

Let's compare each number to 0.4:

1. 0.8 is greater than 0.4.
2. 1/2 is equal to 0.5 when converted to a decimal, which is also greater than 0.4.
3. 0.3 is less than 0.4.
4. 1/3 is equal to approximately 0.333 when converted to a decimal, which is less than 0.4.

So, among the given numbers, 0.3 and 1/3 are less than 0.4.

Therefore, the number of numbers less than 0.4 among the given numbers is 2.
Question: Out of 5 students, 3 are boys and 2 are girls. When 5 people are lined up in a row, find the case where all the female students stand in a row.
Answer: To find the case where both female students stand in a row, we can consider the two girls as a single unit since they must be together. Then, we have 4 units to arrange: 3 boys (B1, B2, B3) and 1 pair of girls (G).

The number of ways to arrange these 4 units in a row is 4! (4 factorial), which is:

4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24

However, within the girls' unit, the two girls can switch places. There are 2! ways to arrange the two girls within their unit, which is:

2! = 2 × 1 = 2

Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange the 5 students such that the two girls are always together is:

4! × 2! = 24 × 2 = 48

So, there are 48 different cases where the two female students stand in a row.

Question: 55 students participated in A competition and B competition. Among them, 38 students participated in A  competition, and 42 students participated in B competition. If no student did not participate in neither competitions A nor B, how many students participated in both competitions?
Answer: Let's denote the number of students who participated in both competitions as X.

According to the problem, we have the following information:

- The total number of students who participated in at least one of the competitions is 55.
- The number of students who participated in competition A is 38.
- The number of students who participated in competition B is 42.

We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of students who participated in both competitions. The principle of inclusion-exclusion states that for any two sets, the size of their union is equal to the sum of the sizes of each set minus the size of their intersection.

In this case, the union of the two sets (students who participated in competition A and students who participated in competition B) is the total number of students who participated in at least one competition, which is 55.

So, we have:

Number of students in A + Number of students in B - Number of students in both A and B = Total number of students

38 (A) + 42 (B) - X (Both A and B) = 55

80 - X = 55

X = 80 - 55

X = 25

Therefore, 25 students participated in both competitions A and B.
Question: If the son's age is 1 year less than 1/4 of the father's age and the father's age is 5 years less than 5 times the son's age, how old is the son?
Answer: Let's denote the son's age as S and the father's age as F.

According to the first statement, the son's age is 1 year less than 1/4 of the father's age. This can be written as:
S = (1/4)F - 1 ...(1)

According to the second statement, the father's age is 5 years less than 5 times the son's age. This can be written as:
F = 5S - 5 ...(2)

Now, we can substitute the expression for F from equation (2) into equation (1) to solve for S:
S = (1/4)(5S - 5) - 1

Multiplying both sides by 4 to get rid of the fraction:
4S = 5S - 5 - 4

Now, let's move all terms involving S to one side and constants to the other side:
4S - 5S = -5 - 4

Combine like terms:
-S = -9

Now, divide both sides by -1 to solve for S:
S = 9

So, the son is 9 years old.
Question: While a centipede can crawl 5 meters (m) in 3 minutes, an earthworm can crawl 5 meters (m) in 2 minutes. If the centipede starts crawling 20 meters (m) ahead of the earthworm and they both start crawling at the same time, find how many minutes takes for them to meet after the departure.
Answer: First, let's find the speed of the centipede and the earthworm.

The centipede crawls 5 meters in 3 minutes, so its speed is:
Speed of centipede = Distance / Time
Speed of centipede = 5 m / 3 min

The earthworm crawls 5 meters in 2 minutes, so its speed is:
Speed of earthworm = Distance / Time
Speed of earthworm = 5 m / 2 min

Now, let's find the relative speed at which the earthworm is gaining on the centipede. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract the speed of the centipede from the speed of the earthworm to find the relative speed.

Relative speed = Speed of earthworm - Speed of centipede
Relative speed = (5/2) m/min - (5/3) m/min

To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 6 in this case.

Relative speed = (15/6) m/min - (10/6) m/min
Relative speed = (15 - 10) / 6 m/min
Relative speed = 5 / 6 m/min

Now, we know the centipede starts 20 meters ahead. We need to find out how long it takes for the earthworm to cover this 20-meter gap at the relative speed.

Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 20 m / (5/6) m/min

To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal.

Time = 20 m * (6/5) min/m
Time = (20 * 6) / 5 minutes
Time = 120 / 5 minutes
Time = 24 minutes

So, it takes 24 minutes for the earthworm to catch up to the centipede after they start crawling.

Question: Find the area in centimeters (cm) of a rectangle whose length is 4 centimeters (cm) and width is 2 centimeters (cm).
Answer: The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length by the width. 

So, for a rectangle with a length of 4 cm and a width of 2 cm, the area would be:

Area = length × width
Area = 4 cm × 2 cm
Area = 8 cm²

Therefore, the area of the rectangle is 8 square centimeters (cm²).
Question: On the day of the soccer match, 12 bottles of water and 34 bottles of soda were given to the players. After the soccer game, I counted all the remaining water and drinks and it was 30 bottles. The number of bottles of drink consumed by the players is three times the number of bottles of water consumed by the players. How many bottles of water did the players drink?
Answer: Let's denote the number of bottles of water consumed by the players as W and the number of bottles of soda consumed as D.

According to the information given, the total number of bottles consumed (water and soda) is three times the number of bottles of water consumed. So we can write the following equation:

D = 3W

We also know that there were initially 12 bottles of water and 34 bottles of soda, and after the game, there were 30 bottles left in total. This means that the number of bottles consumed is:

(12 + 34) - 30 = 46 - 30 = 16 bottles

Now, we have to distribute these 16 bottles between water and soda in such a way that the number of soda bottles consumed is three times the number of water bottles consumed.

Since D = 3W and the total consumed is 16, we can write:

W + D = 16
W + 3W = 16
4W = 16
W = 16 / 4
W = 4

So, the players drank 4 bottles of water.
Question: Hanbyul and Seulgi ran. During the same time, Hanbyul ran 1/100 of 10.2 kilometers (km), and Seulgi ran 100 meters (m). Who ran more?
Answer: First, let's convert Hanbyul's distance into meters since Seulgi's distance is already given in meters. 

1 kilometer is equal to 1000 meters. 

Hanbyul ran 1/100 of 10.2 kilometers, so we calculate:
10.2 km * (1/100) = 0.102 km

Now, convert 0.102 km to meters:
0.102 km * 1000 m/km = 102 m

Now we can compare the distances:
Hanbyul ran 102 meters.
Seulgi ran 100 meters.

Hanbyul ran more, as 102 meters is greater than 100 meters.
Question: What is the difference between the largest number and the smallest number that can be made by selecting four from the number magnets 2, 0, 3, 5, and 8 and arranging them in a row to form a four-digit number?
Answer: The largest possible four-digit number is 8532, and the smallest possible four-digit number is 0235.

The difference between these two numbers is:
8532 - 0235 = 8297

So, the difference between the largest and smallest possible four-digit numbers is

Question: There are 15 red apples, 8 green apples, and 32 pears. How many more pears are there than apples?
Answer: To find out how many more pears there are than apples, we first need to find the total number of apples. 

There are 15 red apples and 8 green apples, so the total number of apples is:

15 red apples + 8 green apples = 23 apples

Now, we compare this to the number of pears:

32 pears - 23 apples = 9 more pears than apples

So, there are 9 more pears than apples.
Question: On the first day, 318 liters (L) of water were added to the pool, and on the second day, 312 liters (L) of water were added. On the third day, 180 liters (L) of water were added in the morning and 162 liters (L) in the afternoon. How many liters (L) of water were added to the pool on average each day?
Answer: To find the average amount of water added to the pool each day, we first need to calculate the total amount of water added over the three days and then divide that total by the number of days.

On the first day, 318 liters were added.
On the second day, 312 liters were added.
On the third day, a total of 180 liters + 162 liters = 342 liters were added.

Now, let's add up the total amount of water added over the three days:
318 liters + 312 liters + 342 liters = 972 liters

Next, we divide the total amount of water by the number of days to find the average:
972 liters / 3 days = 324 liters per day

So, on average, 324 liters of water were added to the pool each day.
