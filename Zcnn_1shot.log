Article: (CNN)The Palestinian Authority officially became the 123rd member of the International Criminal Court on Wednesday, a step that gives the court jurisdiction over alleged crimes in Palestinian territories. The formal accession was marked with a ceremony at The Hague, in the Netherlands, where the court is based. The Palestinians signed the ICC's founding Rome Statute in January, when they also accepted its jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed "in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, since June 13, 2014." Later that month, the ICC opened a preliminary examination into the situation in Palestinian territories, paving the way for possible war crimes investigations against Israelis. As members of the court, Palestinians may be subject to counter-charges as well. Israel and the United States, neither of which is an ICC member, opposed the Palestinians' efforts to join the body. But Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad al-Malki, speaking at Wednesday's ceremony, said it was a move toward greater justice. "As Palestine formally becomes a State Party to the Rome Statute today, the world is also a step closer to ending a long era of impunity and injustice," he said, according to an ICC news release. "Indeed, today brings us closer to our shared goals of justice and peace." Judge Kuniko Ozaki, a vice president of the ICC, said acceding to the treaty was just the first step for the Palestinians. "As the Rome Statute today enters into force for the State of Palestine, Palestine acquires all the rights as well as responsibilities that come with being a State Party to the Statute. These are substantive commitments, which cannot be taken lightly," she said. Rights group Human Rights Watch welcomed the development. "Governments seeking to penalize Palestine for joining the ICC should immediately end their pressure, and countries that support universal acceptance of the court's treaty should speak out to welcome its membership," said Balkees Jarrah, international justice counsel for the group. "What's objectionable is the attempts to undermine international justice, not Palestine's decision to join a treaty to which over 100 countries around the world are members." In January, when the preliminary ICC examination was opened, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described it as an outrage, saying the court was overstepping its boundaries. The United States also said it "strongly" disagreed with the court's decision. "As we have said repeatedly, we do not believe that Palestine is a state and therefore we do not believe that it is eligible to join the ICC," the State Department said in a statement. It urged the warring sides to resolve their differences through direct negotiations. "We will continue to oppose actions against Israel at the ICC as counterproductive to the cause of peace," it said. But the ICC begs to differ with the definition of a state for its purposes and refers to the territories as "Palestine." While a preliminary examination is not a formal investigation, it allows the court to review evidence and determine whether to investigate suspects on both sides. Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said her office would "conduct its analysis in full independence and impartiality." The war between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza last summer left more than 2,000 people dead. The inquiry will include alleged war crimes committed since June. The International Criminal Court was set up in 2002 to prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. CNN's Vasco Cotovio, Kareem Khadder and Faith Karimi contributed to this report.

Article: Whatever you call them, it's always something of a surprise when a game between the biggest and best teams in any country actually turns out to be a footballing classic. Real Madrid and Barcelona attract viewers, but the cynicism on the pitch can drown out the quality in El Clasico. Borussia Dortmund are not consistently good enough to make Der Klassiker a regular spectacle. English football's closest equivalent, Liverpool taking on Manchester United, is now merely a battle for the top four. But, on Easter Sunday, Marseille and Paris St Germain played out a game that not only had a huge bearing on the Ligue 1 title race, but also easily lived up to it's billing as Le Classique. Paris St Germain players celebrate their win in the dressing room after the game, after twice coming from behind to beat rivals Marseille. Andre-Pierre Gignac gets up above Marquinhos to power home the opening goal for Marseille after half an hour. Blaise Matuidi is congratulated by his team-mates after bringing PSG level with a superb curling effort from the edge of the box. Gignac fires home his second goal past Salvatore Sirigu after a mistake from Marco Veratti gave him a clear run on goal, to make it 2-1. Marquinhos jumps for joy after slamming the ball into the roof of the net to make it 2-2 after Zlatan Ibrahimovic's mis-hit free kick. Ibrahimovic put pressure on Jeremy Morel to force an own goal just two minutes later, as PSG went ahead for the first time in the game. Marseille: Mandanda, Romao, Fanni, Morel, Lemina, Dja Djédjé, Mendy, Payet, Thauvin (Ocampos 63 mins), Gignac (Batshuayi 71), Ayew (Alessandrini 72) Subs not used: Aloe, N'Koulou, Samba, Tuiloma. Goals: Gignac 30, 43. Booked: Romao, Fanni, Ayew, Gignac. PSG: Sirigu, Marquinhos, Thiago Silva, David Luiz (Van der Wiel 34), Maxwell, Verratti, Motta, Matuidi, Pastore (Rabiot 82), Ibrahimovic, Cavani (Lavezzi 59),. Subs not used: Douchez, Cabaye, Bahebeck, Digne. Goals: Matuidi 35 Marquinhos 49, Morel OG 51. Booked: Veratti, Pastore. In the end it was PSG who ran out winners, but they twice had to come from behind to see off their fierce rivals in a game that had passion, quality, and goals aplenty. The game was decided by a 130-second burst soon after the half-time break, in which the visitors came from 2-1 down to go 3-2 ahead, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic, predictably, involved in both goals, though not perhaps, in the way that would be expected. First the Swedish star slipped as he struck a free kick at goal, only to see his nothing effort land at the feet of Brazilian defender Marquinhos, who slammed the ball into the roof of the net from close range. Just two minutes later Ibrahimovic might have been on hand to tap home Javier Pastore's low cross, but in the end his presence was enough to force defender Jeremy Morel to divert it past his own goalkeeper. It felt harsh on Marseille, who were the better side for large periods, but they were let down by defensive frailties and an inability to really punhish the PSG backline. Despite the hosts dominance of possession, the champions could easily have won this by three or four goals, such were their chances. Ibrahimovic had several excellent opportunities, the last of which saw Steve Mandanda pull off a remarkable save, while Pastore should have scored at least once, and Mandanda also did well to deny Matuidi late on. All of that without considering the chances the visitors missed before falling behind in the first half, with Ibrahimovic denied a penalty following a clumsy tackle by Morel, Pastore firing wide when clean through, and the woefully out of form Edinson Cavani scuffing a volley straight at the keeper after being picked out by a beautiful chipped pass. Zlatan Ibrahimovic (left) challenges for the ball against Jeremy Morel in the crucial top of the table clash in Ligue 1 on Easter Sunday. Dimitri Payet gets a shot away under pressure from Marco Veratti of PSG in the Stade Veledrome as Marseille looked to take home advantage. On the other hand it is difficult to remember Salvatore Sirigu making too many meaningful saves in the second half, although he did acrobatically tip a Gignac header over the bar shortly before the break to deny the striker a hat-trick. With Lyon having briefly gone top of the table by beating Guingamp earlier in the weekend, it was a game both sides really needed to win to keep up their title challenges. The result puts Laurent Blanc's men top of Ligue 1 again, and is a serious dent to Marseille's hopes. It all looked so different at half time, when an Andre-Pierre Gignac double had his side 2-1 up. The local-born hero first rose above Marquinhos at the back post to head past Sirigu on the half-hour, before slotting past the Italian shortly before half time to restore the lead. Both goals had an element of fortune, with Gignac climbing all over his defender to convert Dimitri Payet's cross, and Marco Veratti gifting him possession through on goal for the second, but nonetheless he took both well. In between was the pick of the goals, a stunner from Blaise Matuidi, who cut inside beautifully, before curling in from the edge of the box, via the fingertips of Mandanda and the inside of the post. PSG's win was marred only by an injury to David Luiz, withdrawn in the first half with what looked like a hamstring pull. But a win over their fierce rivals, and the return to the table's summit, will soften that blow. David Luiz is brought down, and the Brazilian defender was forced off soon after with a hamstring injury which looked serious. Marseille took the lead twice in the first half, but on both occasions they were unable to stay ahead for too long. Gignac celebrates his second goal, and the Marseille striker was only denied his hat-trick by an acrobatic save from Sirigu. Ibrahimovic looks on unimpressed during a difficult first half for the French champions, but his side kept responding to going behind. Marquihos wheels away after scoring his goal, which made the score 2-2 early in the second half, and changed the momentum of the game. The fiery atmosphere bubbled over late on, as Ezequiel Lavezzi was targeted with missiles and laser pointers while trying to take a corner. The home fans produced a passionate atmosphere in the cauldron of the Veledrome as they pursued the French title against their rivals.

Andre-Pierre Gignac puts Marseille ahead on half-hour with powerful back-post header from Dimitri Payet cross. Blaise Matuidi equalises five minutes later with a stunning strike from the edge of the box. Gignac capitalises on terrible PSG defending to restore Marseille's lead before half time. Marquinhos brings PSG level again, before Jeremy Morel own goal puts champions ahead moments later.

Article: (CNN)Never mind cats having nine lives. A stray pooch in Washington State has used up at least three of her own after being hit by a car, apparently whacked on the head with a hammer in a misguided mercy killing and then buried in a field -- only to survive. That's according to Washington State University, where the dog -- a friendly white-and-black bully breed mix now named Theia -- has been receiving care at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital. Four days after her apparent death, the dog managed to stagger to a nearby farm, dirt-covered and emaciated, where she was found by a worker who took her to a vet for help. She was taken in by Moses Lake, Washington, resident Sara Mellado. "Considering everything that she's been through, she's incredibly gentle and loving," Mellado said, according to WSU News. "She's a true miracle dog and she deserves a good life." Theia is only one year old but the dog's brush with death did not leave her unscathed. She suffered a dislocated jaw, leg injuries and a caved-in sinus cavity -- and still requires surgery to help her breathe. The veterinary hospital's Good Samaritan Fund committee awarded some money to help pay for the dog's treatment, but Mellado has set up a fundraising page to help meet the remaining cost of the dog's care. She's also created a Facebook page to keep supporters updated. Donors have already surpassed the $10,000 target, inspired by Theia's tale of survival against the odds. On the fundraising page, Mellado writes, "She is in desperate need of extensive medical procedures to fix her nasal damage and reset her jaw. I agreed to foster her until she finally found a loving home." She is dedicated to making sure Theia gets the medical attention she needs, Mellado adds, and wants to "make sure she gets placed in a family where this will never happen to her again!" Any additional funds raised will be "paid forward" to help other animals. Theia is not the only animal to apparently rise from the grave in recent weeks. A cat in Tampa, Florida, found seemingly dead after he was hit by a car in January, showed up alive in a neighbor's yard five days after he was buried by his owner. The cat was in bad shape, with maggots covering open wounds on his body and a ruined left eye, but remarkably survived with the help of treatment from the Humane Society.

Article: Liverpool vice-captain Jordan Henderson thinks his side could catch Manchester City in the Barclays Premier League having fought through a tough and long season at Anfield. Henderson and Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet both played their 47th game of season in the 2-0 win over Newcastle United on Monday night, equalling the record for appearances by any player in the top five European leagues so far this campaign. But the England midfielder believes that after finding winning form again following poor results against Manchester United and Arsenal, Liverpool can pile the pressure on to City who sit four points above them in the race for the Champions League. Liverpool vice-captain Jordan Henderson thinks his side could catch Manchester City in the  Premier League. Henderson played his 47th game of season in the 2-0 win over Newcastle United on Monday night. Manchester City have been faltering and lost 4-2 at Manchester United, Liverpool are four points behind. 'We knew it was an important game for us,' Henderson said 'Obviously the last couple of weeks in the Premier League have been disappointing both with performances and results. We knew today we needed to put that right and I think we did that with a great result for us. 'We've got ground to make up but we'll just keep going, keep winning in games and putting in performances. Come the end of the season, you never know.' Raheem Sterling pulled off some fine skill to open the scoring in the ninth minute at Anfield before Joe Allen capitalised on a defensive mistake to score his first Anfield goal with 20 minutes to go. Raheem Sterling pulled off some fine skill to open the scoring in the ninth minute at Anfield on Monday night. Joe Allen capitalised on a defensive mistake to score his first Anfield goal to make it 2-0 with 20 minutes to go. 'It was great to get that goal to give us that two-goal cushion,' Allen said. 'It wasn't my best game but I got the goal and helped the team. It was important after the defeats.' Newcastle had what looked a strong shout for a penalty when Dejan Lovren appeared to foul Ayoze Perez in the area, and Allen admitted he thought it was a spot-kick. 'I did get a good view of it as I'd missed the ball in the build-up,' he said. 'It look a good shout for a penalty, but I didn't get one the other night. These things happen.' Liverpool's players congratulate Allen on his goal that secured another vital win in the Premier League battle.

Liverpool beat Newcastle United 2-0 at Anfield on Monday night. The win moved them to within four points of fourth-place Manchester City. Jordan Henderson has played a Europe-wide record 47 games this season. But he hopes Liverpool have staying power to put pressure on City.

Article: (CNN)If you've been following the news lately, there are certain things you doubtless know about Mohammad Javad Zarif. He is, of course, the Iranian foreign minister. He has been U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's opposite number in securing a breakthrough in nuclear discussions that could lead to an end to sanctions against Iran -- if the details can be worked out in the coming weeks. And he received a hero's welcome as he arrived in Iran on a sunny Friday morning. "Long live Zarif," crowds chanted as his car rolled slowly down the packed street. You may well have read that he is "polished" and, unusually for one burdened with such weighty issues, "jovial." An Internet search for "Mohammad Javad Zarif" and "jovial" yields thousands of results. He certainly has gone a long way to bring Iran in from the cold and allow it to rejoin the international community. But there are some facts about Zarif that are less well-known. Here are six:. In September 2013, Zarif tweeted "Happy Rosh Hashanah," referring to the Jewish New Year. That prompted Christine Pelosi, the daughter of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, to respond with a tweet of her own: "Thanks. The New Year would be even sweeter if you would end Iran's Holocaust denial, sir." And, perhaps to her surprise, Pelosi got a response. "Iran never denied it," Zarif tweeted back. "The man who was perceived to be denying it is now gone. Happy New Year." The reference was likely to former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who had left office the previous month. Zarif was nominated to be foreign minister by Ahmadinejad's successor, Hassan Rouhami. His foreign ministry notes, perhaps defensively, that "due to the political and security conditions of the time, he decided to continue his education in the United States." That is another way of saying that he was outside the country during the demonstrations against the Shah of Iran, which began in 1977, and during the Iranian Revolution, which drove the shah from power in 1979. Zarif left the country in 1977, received his undergraduate degree from San Francisco State University in 1981, his master's in international relations from the University of Denver in 1984 and his doctorate from the University of Denver in 1988. Both of his children were born in the United States. The website of the Iranian Foreign Ministry, which Zarif runs, cannot even agree with itself on when he was born. The first sentence of his official biography, perhaps in a nod to the powers that be in Tehran, says Zarif was "born to a religious traditional family in Tehran in 1959." Later on the same page, however, his date of birth is listed as January 8, 1960. And the Iranian Diplomacy website says he was born in in 1961. So he is 54, 55 or maybe even 56. Whichever, he is still considerably younger than his opposite number, Kerry, who is 71. The feds investigated him over his alleged role in controlling the Alavi Foundation, a charitable organization. The U.S. Justice Department said the organization was secretly run on behalf of the Iranian government to launder money and get around U.S. sanctions. But last year, a settlement in the case, under which the foundation agreed to give a 36-story building in Manhattan along with other properties to the U.S. government, did not mention Zarif's name. Early in the Iranian Revolution, Zarif was among the students who took over the Iranian Consulate in San Francisco. The aim, says the website Iranian.com -- which cites Zarif's memoirs, titled "Mr. Ambassador" -- was to expel from the consulate people who were not sufficiently Islamic. Later, the website says, Zarif went to make a similar protest at the Iranian mission to the United Nations. In response, the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations offered him a job. In fact, he has now spent more time with Kerry than any other foreign minister in the world. And that amount of quality time will only increase as the two men, with help from other foreign ministers as well, try to meet a June 30 deadline for nailing down the details of the agreement they managed to outline this week in Switzerland.

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, a polished and jovial diplomat, has been instrumental in securing a breakthrough in nuclear discussions with the US, but there are several lesser-known facts about him, including his education in the US and his role in the Iranian

Article: (CNN)Five Americans who were monitored for three weeks at an Omaha, Nebraska, hospital after being exposed to Ebola in West Africa have been released, a Nebraska Medicine spokesman said in an email Wednesday. One of the five had a heart-related issue on Saturday and has been discharged but hasn't left the area, Taylor Wilson wrote. The others have already gone home. They were exposed to Ebola in Sierra Leone in March, but none developed the deadly virus. They are clinicians for Partners in Health, a Boston-based aid group. They all had contact with a colleague who was diagnosed with the disease and is being treated at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. As of Monday, that health care worker is in fair condition. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta has said the last of 17 patients who were being monitored are expected to be released by Thursday. More than 10,000 people have died in a West African epidemic of Ebola that dates to December 2013, according to the World Health Organization. Almost all the deaths have been in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Ebola is spread by direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person.

Article: (CNN)A Duke student has admitted to hanging a noose made of rope from a tree near a student union, university officials said Thursday. The prestigious private school didn't identify the student, citing federal privacy laws. In a news release, it said the student was no longer on campus and will face student conduct review. The student was identified during an investigation by campus police and the office of student affairs and admitted to placing the noose on the tree early Wednesday, the university said. Officials are still trying to determine if other people were involved. Criminal investigations into the incident are ongoing as well. Students and faculty members marched Wednesday afternoon chanting "We are not afraid. We stand together,"  after pictures of the noose were passed around on social media. At a forum held on the steps of Duke Chapel, close to where the noose was discovered at 2 a.m., hundreds of people gathered. "You came here for the reason that you want to say with me, 'This is no Duke we will accept. This is no Duke we want. This is not the Duke we're here to experience. And this is not the Duke we're here to create,' " Duke President Richard Brodhead told the crowd. The incident is one of several recent racist events to affect college students. Last month a fraternity at the University of Oklahoma had its charter removed after a video surfaced showing members using the N-word and referring to lynching in a chant. Two students were expelled. In February, a noose was hung around the neck of a statue of a famous civil rights figure at the University of Mississippi. A statement issued by Duke said there was a previous report of hate speech directed at students on campus. In the news release, the vice president for student affairs called the noose incident a "cowardly act." "To whomever committed this hateful and stupid act, I just want to say that if your intent was to create fear, it will have the opposite effect," Larry Moneta said Wednesday.

Article: Andre Ayew is keen on a move to Liverpool this summer. The Ghana international will be a free agent as he is out of contract at Marseille and wants to join the Anfield club who he supported as a boy. Everton, Newcastle and Swansea have all shown interest while Ayew's representatives have held talks with Roma. Wolfsburg, Borussia Dortmund and Napoli are also keen to speak to him. Ayew, 25, was born in France but followed his father Abedi Pele by playing for Ghana where he has become one of their star performers notably scoring in the World Cup finals last summer against USA and eventual winners Germany. Andre Ayew is out of contract at Marseille in the summer and is keen on a move to England. The Ghana international admits he supported Liverpool as a boy and would like to play for the Anfield club. Although emotionally attached to Marseille, he admits he is seeking a new challenge and is ready to test himself in the Premier League. Talking to Sportsmail, he said: 'I'm a Marseille boy, I love Marseille, the club, the fans, the area, it's a great place to play football and I will continue to speak to them but it's true I'd like to play in England.' Ayew, who is represented in England by agent Mark McKay of ExcelFoot, added: 'I grew up watching English football and I support Liverpool. Steven Gerrard is my favourite player. They have always had exciting teams and now they are a club that likes to play with pace and give chances to young players. Ayew's favourite player growing up was Steven Gerrard, who will leave Liverpool at the end of the season. A player he knew from their time together at Marseille, Ayew speaks regularly to Joey Barton (right) 'I'm 25 now and it is a good age for me to take the next step in my career. I have offers from England, Italy and Germany but it would be unfair to say who from. I speak to my friends such as Morgan Amalfitano at West Ham and Joey Barton at QPR and they always talk well about the league and the atmosphere. 'I have been fortunate to experience Stamford Bridge and Old Trafford in the Champions League but I want to play at Anfield and other grounds. 'I know my quality. I have shown I can play at Marseille and I have taken on responsibility with my country. It's important that you always strive to be better. You see with players such as Eden Hazard how hard they work and I believe in hard work to get better. It's easy to talk though, what is important is that I do it.' The Ghana international is also being looked at by Swansea, Newcastle and Everton in the Premier League. Liverpool have already secured the signing of Divock Origi (left), who will move to Anfield in the summer. Ayew's ideal is to help Marseille win the French league but it will be difficult as they trail leaders Paris Saint-Germain by five points. 'I will fight to the end for Marseille then I will make my decision. It is an important step for me.' Liverpool already have Divock Origi in the bag and are keen on Burnley's Danny Ings but will be enthused that a player of Ayew's pedigree has such desire to play for them. Failure to reach the Champions League could also mean he falls within their budget as a free transfer. Brendan Rodgers wants a goalkeeper, midfielder and a full-back as well as a forward. He likes Memphis Depay at PSV Eindhoven but the Holland international is expected to join Manchester United.

Article: (CNN)He's a blue chip college basketball recruit. She's a high school freshman with Down syndrome. At first glance Trey Moses and Ellie Meredith couldn't be more different. But all that changed Thursday when Trey asked Ellie to be his prom date. Trey -- a star on Eastern High School's basketball team in Louisville, Kentucky, who's headed to play college ball next year at Ball State -- was originally going to take his girlfriend to Eastern's prom. So why is he taking Ellie instead? "She's great... she listens and she's easy to talk to" he said. Trey made the prom-posal (yes, that's what they are calling invites to prom these days) in the gym during Ellie's P.E. class. Trina Helson, a teacher at Eastern, alerted the school's newspaper staff to the prom-posal and posted photos of Trey and Ellie on Twitter that have gone viral. She wasn't surpristed by Trey's actions. "That's the kind of person Trey is," she said. To help make sure she said yes, Trey entered the gym armed with flowers and a poster that read "Let's Party Like it's 1989," a reference to the latest album by Taylor Swift, Ellie's favorite singer. Trey also got the OK from Ellie's parents the night before via text. They were thrilled. "You just feel numb to those moments raising a special needs child,"  said Darla Meredith, Ellie's mom. "You first feel the need to protect and then to overprotect." Darla Meredith said Ellie has struggled with friendships since elementary school, but a special program at Eastern called Best Buddies had made things easier for her. She said Best Buddies cultivates friendships between students with and without developmental disabilities and prevents students like Ellie from feeling isolated and left out of social functions. "I guess around middle school is when kids started to care about what others thought," she said, but "this school, this year has been a relief." Trey's future coach at Ball State, James Whitford, said he felt great about the prom-posal, noting that Trey, whom he's known for a long time, often works with other kids. Trey's mother, Shelly Moses, was also proud of her son. "It's exciting to bring awareness to a good cause," she said. "Trey has worked pretty hard, and he's a good son." Both Trey and Ellie have a lot of planning to do. Trey is looking to take up special education as a college major, in addition to playing basketball in the fall. As for Ellie, she can't stop thinking about prom. "Ellie can't wait to go dress shopping" her mother said. "Because I've only told about a million people!" Ellie interjected.

Article: These are the horrific final moments of a 44-year-old suspect who was apparently accidentally shot dead by a 73-year-old reserve deputy last week after he fired his handgun instead of his Taser. In the footage, released by police, deputies are filmed chasing after Eric Harris, first by car then on foot, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on April 2 after he fled during a sting operation in a nearby parking lot. Once they catch up to Harris, they tackle him to the ground and order him to lie on his stomach. Robert Bates then yells, 'Taser! Taser!' - but takes out his service weapon and pulls the trigger. After firing one round into Harris, the former full-time officer drops his gun from the recoil and says in shock: 'Oh, I shot him! I'm sorry.' Harris then starts yelping on the ground, while pleading for help. WARNING: GRAPHIC VIDEO. Chase: This newly-released video of Eric Harris's fatal shooting shows deputies chasing after Harris, first by car then on foot, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on April 2 after he fled during a sting operation in a nearby parking lot. Fleeing: The deputies run after Harris, who was allegedly caught trying to buy drugs and a gun from cops. View from the ground: Once they catch up to Harris, they tackle him to the ground and order him to lie on his stomach. Robert Bates then yells, 'Taser! Taser!' (pictured) - but takes out his handgun and pulls the trigger. The fatally-wounded man, who is being held down by his neck by the deputies, exclaims: 'Oh my god, he shot me! He shot me! He shot me, man.' He then adds: 'Oh, my god. I'm losing my breath.' Shockingly, one of the deputies replies: 'F*** your breath.' Another calls Harris, who is black and dressed in shorts and a T-shirt, a'motherf***er' and tells him: 'You shouldn't have f***ing ran.' Following the incident, during which the deputies do not appear to realize Harris has been fatally injured and even tell him to'shut the f*** up', the suspect was hospitalized. He died an hour later. The footage, obtained by NewsOn6, comes as a number of US shootings  involving police officers and  black suspects have hit the headlines. Many of the suspects were unarmed at the time. In the April 2 incident, Bates accidentally fired his gun thinking that he had pulled out his Taser - as proved by the fact he did not expect the weapon to recoil, the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office said. Bates, who had been monitoring the situation from afar, ran up to Harris in a bid 'to get the situation under control', before mistakenly firing his gun instead of his Taser, according to on-site deputies. Apology: After firing one round into Harris, the former full-time officer drops his gun from the recoil and says in shock: 'Oh, I shot him! I'm sorry' (pictured) Harris then starts yelping on the ground, while shouting, 'Help!' Shooting: This photo shows a deputy bending down to pick up Bates's dropped gun following the 'accidental' shooting in Tulsa earlier this month. Harris is being held down on the ground, out of shot, by other deputies. Terrified: The fatally-wounded man, who is being held by his neck and back by the deputies (pictured), says: 'Oh my god, he shot me! He shot me! He shot me, man.' He then adds: 'Oh, my god. I'm losing my breath' Suspect: Shockingly, one of the deputies replies: 'F*** your breath.' Another calls Harris (pictured in a police mug shot released d by officials on April 4) a'motherf***er' and tells him: 'You shouldn't have f***ing ran' Harris, who was being restrained at the time, had  allegedly fled after he was caught trying to buy drugs and a gun from deputies posing as dealers in the parking lot of a nearby dollar store. Major Shannon Clark told CNN: 'They were struggling trying to get him into custody, he ran up trying to use a less lethal device, trying to get the situation under control. 'Inadvertently he discharged a round from his service weapon.' He added: 'Did an accident happen? Sure. But is it accredited to his age? Or was it accredited to the rapidly evolving situation? I guess that will be determined in the investigation.' Bates, who has been a reserve since 2008, is the chief executive of Robert C Bates LLC, a Tulsa-based insurance company, who worked as an officer assigned to the Violent Crimes Task Force. Fatal: Following the incident, during which the deputies told Harris to'shut the f*** up', the suspect was hospitalized. He died an hour later. Above, blood appears to be running down Harris's arm at the scene. Scene: In this photo, which has been partially blanked out by the Sheriff's Office, deputies are pictured at the scene of the incident. The deputy in the foreground of the frame is holding down Harris following the shooting. He has also spent time with the Tulsa Police Auxiliary. Speaking to local site News OK, Bates said: 'It was me. My attorney has advised me not to comment. As much as I would like to, I can’t.' According to Tulsa Police, Harris had met an undercover officer to sell him a 9 mm semi-automatic pistol and 300 rounds ammunition. He fled the scene when deputies tried to arrest him, it is alleged. The suspect then fought with another deputy when he was shot, police said. He was gunned down accidentally by Bates after officers 'observed him reaching for his waistband area... causing concern for the deputies' safety,' authorities told CNN. Officers had been monitoring Harris as part of an investigation into the trade of methamphetamine. As he met with undercover deputies to allegedly hand over the drugs, he is accused of offering to throw in a sawed-off gun. Confusion: Bates, 73, accidentally grabbed his pistol and shot Harris (right, in a previous mug shot) dead, according to Tulsa police. Bates is classified as an advanced deputy. The incident is now under investigation. His convictions include escaping prison in 1990, robbery with a dangerous weapon in 1999, and making threatening phone calls. According to Tulsa Police, Harris' killer, Bates, is classified as an advanced deputy. Reserves are 'basic', 'intermediate', or 'advanced'. The qualify for 'advanced', officers are required to have a minimum of 320 hours of training and 25 hours of training a year. During the annual field training program, they are tested on how to use and identify lethal and non-lethal weapons. With the same power as paid deputies, reserves can conduct their own investigations, make arrests and work on task forces. The cause of Harris's death is under investigation.

Article: (CNN)Governments around the world are using the threat of terrorism -- real or perceived -- to advance executions, Amnesty International alleges in its annual report on the death penalty. "The dark trend of governments using the death penalty in a futile attempt to tackle real or imaginary threats to state security and public safety was stark last year," said Salil Shetty, Amnesty's Secretary General in a release. "It is shameful that so many states around the world are essentially playing with people's lives -- putting people to death for 'terrorism' or to quell internal instability on the ill-conceived premise of deterrence." The report, "Death Sentences and Executions 2014," cites the example of Pakistan lifting a six-year moratorium on the execution of civilians following the horrific attack on a school in Peshawar in December. China is also mentioned, as having used the death penalty as a tool in its "Strike Hard" campaign against terrorism in the restive far-western province of Xinjiang. The annual report catalogs the use of state-sanctioned killing as a punitive measure across the globe, and this year's edition contains some mixed findings. On one hand, the number of executions worldwide has gone down by almost 22% on the previous year. At least 607 people were executed around the world in 2014, compared to 778 in 2013. Amnesty's figures do not include statistics on executions carried out in China, where information on the practice is regarded as a state secret. Belarus and Vietnam, too, do not release data on death penalty cases. "The long-term trend is definitely positive -- we are seeing a decrease in the number of executions (worldwide)," Audrey Gaughran, Amnesty's Director of Global Issues, told CNN. "A number of countries are closer to abolition, and there are some signs that some countries will be abolitionist by 2015. (There are) signals of a world that is nearing abolition." While the report notes some encouraging signs, it also highlights a marked increase in the number of people sentenced to death in 2014. At least 2,466 people globally are confirmed to have been handed the sentence last year, an increase of 28% compared with 2013. The report notes that the spike in sentencing is attributable to mass-sentencing in countries including Egypt and Nigeria, "against scores of people in some cases." The organization found "positive developments" worldwide, with most regions seeming to show reductions in the number of executions. Opinion: Sharp spike in death sentences. Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, saw a 28% fall in reported cases, and executions recorded in the Middle East and North Africa were down 23% compared to 2013. "Even though we've highlighted some of the negative developments... I think we would always highlight that there are positive developments," Gaughran said. "Across the board, with the exception of Europe and Central Asia there were fewer reports of executions in every region." The resumption of the use of capital punishment in Belarus -- the only country in Europe and Central Asia to execute people -- after a two year hiatus spoiled an near-universal decrease in countries using the death penalty by region. The United States has the dubious distinction of being the only country in the Americas to conduct executions, but the number of convicts put to death here fell slightly, from 39 in 2013 to 35 in 2014. The state of Washington also imposed a moratorium on executions last year. The U.S. remains one of the worst offenders for imposing capital punishment, with only Iran (289+), Iraq (61+), and Saudi Arabia (90+) executing more people in 2014. While figures are not available, Amnesty estimates that China also executes "thousands" of prisoners each year, "more than the rest of the world put together." The report also highlights the imperfections in the judiciary processes that lead to many sentenced to death. "In the majority of countries where people were sentenced to death or executed, the death penalty was imposed after proceedings that did not meet international fair trial standards," the report stated. "In 2014 Amnesty International raised particular concerns in relation to court proceedings in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, China, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Sri Lanka." The United Nations Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, last year stressed the need to move toward abolition of capital punishment. "The taking of life is too irreversible for one human being to inflict it on another," he said, in marking World Day against Death Penalty in October. "We must continue to argue strongly that the death penalty is unjust and incompatible with fundamental human rights." Amnesty estimates that at least 19,094 people were believed to be on death row at the end of 2014.

Article: She captured hearts across the nation as she realized her dream to play for Mount St. Joseph's women's basketball team in Ohio and raised $1.5million - all while battling inoperable brain cancer. And one of the millions Lauren Hill touched was LeBron James, who posted an emotional farewell letter to the teenager via Twitter on Friday, just hours after she passed away from her rare tumor. In the letter, the basketball star, dubbed King James, praised the 19-year-old for the 'leadership', 'courage' and'strength' she had shown while suffering from Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG). James, 30, who had never actually met Lauren, wrote: 'Dear Lauren Hill, You are the true definition of strength, courage, power, leadership, etc etc! Your time spent on earth will never be forgotten. Scroll down for video. Farewell: LeBron James (left) posted an emotional farewell letter to Lauren Hill via Twitter on Friday, just hours after the teenager passed away from terminal brain cancer. Right, Lauren plays college basketball last year. Praise: In the letter, James, 30, who had never actually met Lauren, wrote: 'Dear Lauren Hill, You are the true definition of strength, courage, power, leadership, etc etc! Your time spent on earth will never be forgotten' 'You inspired me': He continued: 'I [hate] that I never got the chance to meet u in person but know you inspired me the whole time! For every life u touched, u made the biggest impact [on] them by just being YOU!! 'I [hate] that I never got the chance to meet u in person but know you inspired me the whole time! For every life u touched, u made the biggest impact [on] them by just being YOU!! 'You're in a far better place now and please don't have too much fun up there w/o all your family and friends. Can u please tell my Grandma I said hello. 'Don't be afraid, she knows you cause we spoke about u plenty of times Until we officially meet again, take care and continue to be that LEADER we all love! ‪#‎RIPLaurenHill.' The Cleveland Cavaliers player signed off the letter - which was posted to his Twitter page - 'Sincerely, LeBron James'. The letter has since been retweeted tens of thousands of times. Many users have deemed the tribute 'touching' and 'beautiful'. One told James - who competed against the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday night - that it 'was so sweet it brought me to tears'. Lauren, who was diagnosed with a rare form of brain cancer shortly after her 18th birthday, had repeatedly defied doctors' expectations after they told her that she would not live past December. A touching tribute: James told Lauren not to have 'too much fun up there without all your family and friends' 'Tell my Grandma I said hello': He added that he had spoken 'plenty of times' about Lauren to his grandmother. #RIPLaurenHill: The Cleveland Cavaliers player signed off the letter - which was posted to his Twitter page - 'Sincerely, LeBron James' (pictured). The letter has since been retweeted tens of thousands of times. Instead, the Indiana native played four games with her team at Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati, and raised more than $1.5 million for research into the cancer she suffered from. But as her condition worsened, the teenager became an honorary coach and earlier this year, she moved to Cincinnati Children's Hospital. She passed away at the hospital on Friday morning. As news of her death became public, thousands of people across the country - both basketball fans and not - took to social media to express their sorrow at her death, and show support for her family. Only a year and a half ago, Lauren, whose cancer saw her rapidly gain weight, had been just another teenager preparing for college after deciding to play basketball for Mount St. Joseph. But a few weeks later, she started feeling dizzy while playing for her high school team in nearby Lawrenceburg, Indiana. Tests found her tumor and she was told she had less than two years left. Diagnosis: Lauren is pictured left in December 2013, and right, in December 2014, after her treatment for Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG), a rare childhood brain cancer which changed her appearance. Brave: Lauren, who used her limited energy to inspire people and raise money for research into the cancer that ultimately took her life, is pictured in her room in Cincinnati last December - months before she passed away. In September, doctors gave her the devastating news she wouldn't make it past December - and after years as a standout player, Lauren's hopes of playing college basketball were put in jeopardy. However, the NCAA granted permission to move the school's opening game forward because of her worsening condition. On November 2, Lauren realized her dream of playing for the school. Incredibly, she scored the first and last baskets of the team's 66-55 victory over Hiram College. Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a type of brain tumor found in the part of the brainstem at the lower back of the brain. Due to the tumor's location, it can cause double vision, difficulty controlling eye movement and facial expressions, and difficulty swallowing and chewing. It may also cause weakness in the limbs. The condition primarily affects children most often between the ages of four and nine. Between 100 and 150 new diagnoses are made a year in the U.S. Only 300 are made across North America and Europe a year. It can be treated with radiation, but chemotherapy is generally not effective and surgery is impossible due to the spread of the cancer into healthy tissue. Unlike with other childhood cancers, there has been little progress in improving treatments and cure rates for the condition over the last few decades. Fewer than 10 per cent of children with DIPG survive two years after their diagnosis. Source: DIPG Registry. 'It's a dream come true,' Lauren told reporters at the time. 'To play on a college court, to put my foot down on the floor and hear the roar of the crowd - I just love it so much. I love basketball. 'Everything that happened today was amazing. I'm truly happy, it's a really good day.' At the game, Lauren said she wanted to find a cure for the rare cancer, which has a less than 10 per cent survival rate and most often affects children aged four to nine. 'When I was diagnosed I remember kind of feeling lonely because nobody understood,' she said following the game, USA Today reported. 'And now that more people know about this story and the awareness of DIPG. 'I'm so happy that people know about it now and that we can get some research going and hopefully find that home run cure for cancer. And even though I'm probably not going to be around to see it, it's going to help a lot of people.' Lauren played in four games and made five layups before the spreading tumor made her stop. When the season ended, her team held its annual dinner in the hospital where Hill was being treated. She was also honored at local sporting events and was featured on a box of Wheaties - known as the Breakfast of Champions. The U.S. Basketball Writers Association voted her the Pat Summitt Most Courageous Award, which is normally awarded at the Final Four. Athletes from other colleges autographed No. 22 jerseys - her number - and sent them in support. As the cancer slowed her down, Lauren's family, friends and teammates took a bigger role in promoting her fundraising campaign - and she kept reminding everyone to appreciate life. 'Life is precious,' she told WKRC-TV before her death. 'Every moment you get with someone is a moment that's blessed, really blessed.' Final days: Lauren is pictured enjoying Easter (left) and St Patrick's Day (right) from hospital in Cincinnati. Fighter: The NCAA moved Mount St. Joseph's first basketball game forward last November (pictured) so that Lauren could achieve her dream of playing for collegiate basketball. She scored the first and last baskets. The co-founder of her nonprofit foundation confirmed Lauren's death in hospital on Friday. 'Through Lauren's fundraising and advocacy efforts, she not only became a spotlight on the lack of funding for cancer research, but she most certainly has become a beacon guiding researchers for years to come,' The Cure Starts Now co-founder Brooke Desserich said. Her nonprofit foundation helped to raise more than $1.5 million for cancer research. 'She's made an impact on the world, more so than me - more than I ever will do,' Lauren's coach Dan Benjamin said. 'I've gotten so many emails and phone calls from all over the world. People are contacting me because they want to share her story.' No information about a memorial has yet been released, but Lawrenceburg Schools superintendent Karl Galey said on Twitter that schools will be prepared to assist staff and students with counseling. Heroic: Lauren, pictured left, smiles at Pat Summitt after receiving the Pat Summitt Award during halftime of her first NCAA college basketball game in November last year. She went on to play four games for the school. Dear Lauren Hill,. You are the true definition of strength, courage, power, leadership, etc etc! Your time spent on earth will never be forgotten. I [hate] that I never got the chance to meet u in person but know you inspired me the whole time! For every life u touched, u made the biggest impact [on] them by just being YOU!!

Article: (CNN)Andrew Getty, one of the heirs to billions of oil money, appears to have died of natural causes, a Los Angeles Police Department spokesman said. The coroner's preliminary assessment is there was no foul play involved in the death of Getty, grandson of oil tycoon J. Paul Getty, said Detective Meghan Aguilar. Andrew Getty, 47, had "several health issues," Aguilar said, adding that an autopsy will be conducted. There is no criminal investigation underway, he said. Some medication had also been recovered from Getty's home, though investigators don't know whether Getty was taking it or what his medical history was, Ed Winter, assistant chief in the Los Angeles County coroner's office, told CNN affiliate KTLA Tuesday night. KTLA reported that Getty was found on his side near a bathroom in his home. Getty's parents, Ann and Gordon Getty, released a statement confirming their son's death and asking for privacy. Where the Getty family fortune came from. Gordon Getty is one of three living sons of J. Paul Getty, the oil baron who was thought to be the richest man in the world at the time of his death in 1976. Gordon Getty, 81, has a net worth of $2.1 billion, according to Forbes. One other son died in 1958 and another died in 1973. Gordon Getty spearheaded the controversial sale of Getty to Texaco for $10 billion in 1984. In its list of richest American families, Forbes estimated the Gettys' net worth to be about $5 billion. Court records show Andrew Getty had recently filed to get a restraining order against an ex-girlfriend. A hearing in the case had been scheduled for next week. In his request, Getty said he had been diagnosed with a serious medical condition in 2013. "A rise in my blood pressure places me in grave risk of substantial and irreparable injury or death," he wrote in the petition. "My doctors have advised that heated arguments can cause my blood pressure to rise dangerously." Andrew Getty had three brothers and three half-sisters. People we've lost in 2015. CNN's Doug Criss, Janet DiGiacomo, Mark Mooney, Mike Love, Julie In and Cheri Mossburg contributed to this report.

Article: Tony Pulis has discussed pre-season plans with Saido Berahino in an indication he plans to keep the striker beyond the summer transfer window. Berahino is likely to be away with Gareth Southgate’s England under 21 side in the Czech Republic until late June so Pulis has begun his preparations early. West Bromwich Albion were open to bids of £20million for Berahino in January and the 21-year-old has said he would leave to fulfil his desire to play in Champions League football. West Brom manager Tony Pulis has talked pre-season plans with Saido Berahino in an indication the England under 21 striker will remain at The Hawthorns beyond the summer. Berahino has been linked with a move away from West Brom after saying he wants to play European football. Pulis said: ‘Hopefully he's away with the under 21s so I have had a chat with him about pre-season and the time he'll have off but I haven't spoken about anything else to him. ‘I think the kid is happy here, he has played that way and certainly worked that way. We're more than happy to have him here because he has been very good.’ Berahino shares the same agent as Raheem Sterling, Aidy Ward, who was criticised by Brendan Rodgers over the Liverpool player’s contract stand-off. Pulis said: ‘Agents can have a massive influence on players in lots of respects. My argument to that is in the same in life, you get good agents and you get bad agents. Berahino is likely to be included in the England under 21 squad for this summer's European Championships. Berahino scored a vital goal in England's under 21 play-off with Croatia back in October. 'Professional footballers have been given a gift and they have a lifespan of about 10-12 years. We should never forget that. To be the best is what they should be aiming for. ‘If I had an agent I'd just say, 'Look after the money, make sure when I finish this job I have enough to look after my family'.

It boasts steady winds of more than 70 mph (115 kph) and gusts up to 90 mph as of 5 p.m. (5 a.m. ET) Saturday. Still, that doesn't mean Maysak won't pack a wallop. Authorities took preemptive steps to keep people safe such as barring outdoor activities like swimming, surfing, diving and boating in some locales, as well as a number of precautionary evacuations. Gabriel Llave, a disaster official, told PNA that tourists who arrive Saturday in and around the coastal town of Aurora "will not be accepted by the owners of hotels, resorts, inns and the like... and will be advised to return to their respective places."

England attempted to make the most of a bad lot when they loaned Jonathan Trott, Gary Ballance and Jonny Bairstow to their opponents to give them additional practice.

Jonathan Trott, who had switched to the Saint Kitts team, was removed for a duck by James Anderson.
