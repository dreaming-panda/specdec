Article: (CNN)The Palestinian Authority officially became the 123rd member of the International Criminal Court on Wednesday, a step that gives the court jurisdiction over alleged crimes in Palestinian territories. The formal accession was marked with a ceremony at The Hague, in the Netherlands, where the court is based. The Palestinians signed the ICC's founding Rome Statute in January, when they also accepted its jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed "in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, since June 13, 2014." Later that month, the ICC opened a preliminary examination into the situation in Palestinian territories, paving the way for possible war crimes investigations against Israelis. As members of the court, Palestinians may be subject to counter-charges as well. Israel and the United States, neither of which is an ICC member, opposed the Palestinians' efforts to join the body. But Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad al-Malki, speaking at Wednesday's ceremony, said it was a move toward greater justice. "As Palestine formally becomes a State Party to the Rome Statute today, the world is also a step closer to ending a long era of impunity and injustice," he said, according to an ICC news release. "Indeed, today brings us closer to our shared goals of justice and peace." Judge Kuniko Ozaki, a vice president of the ICC, said acceding to the treaty was just the first step for the Palestinians. "As the Rome Statute today enters into force for the State of Palestine, Palestine acquires all the rights as well as responsibilities that come with being a State Party to the Statute. These are substantive commitments, which cannot be taken lightly," she said. Rights group Human Rights Watch welcomed the development. "Governments seeking to penalize Palestine for joining the ICC should immediately end their pressure, and countries that support universal acceptance of the court's treaty should speak out to welcome its membership," said Balkees Jarrah, international justice counsel for the group. "What's objectionable is the attempts to undermine international justice, not Palestine's decision to join a treaty to which over 100 countries around the world are members." In January, when the preliminary ICC examination was opened, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described it as an outrage, saying the court was overstepping its boundaries. The United States also said it "strongly" disagreed with the court's decision. "As we have said repeatedly, we do not believe that Palestine is a state and therefore we do not believe that it is eligible to join the ICC," the State Department said in a statement. It urged the warring sides to resolve their differences through direct negotiations. "We will continue to oppose actions against Israel at the ICC as counterproductive to the cause of peace," it said. But the ICC begs to differ with the definition of a state for its purposes and refers to the territories as "Palestine." While a preliminary examination is not a formal investigation, it allows the court to review evidence and determine whether to investigate suspects on both sides. Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said her office would "conduct its analysis in full independence and impartiality." The war between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza last summer left more than 2,000 people dead. The inquiry will include alleged war crimes committed since June. The International Criminal Court was set up in 2002 to prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. CNN's Vasco Cotovio, Kareem Khadder and Faith Karimi contributed to this report.

Article: Whatever you call them, it's always something of a surprise when a game between the biggest and best teams in any country actually turns out to be a footballing classic. Real Madrid and Barcelona attract viewers, but the cynicism on the pitch can drown out the quality in El Clasico. Borussia Dortmund are not consistently good enough to make Der Klassiker a regular spectacle. English football's closest equivalent, Liverpool taking on Manchester United, is now merely a battle for the top four. But, on Easter Sunday, Marseille and Paris St Germain played out a game that not only had a huge bearing on the Ligue 1 title race, but also easily lived up to it's billing as Le Classique. Paris St Germain players celebrate their win in the dressing room after the game, after twice coming from behind to beat rivals Marseille. Andre-Pierre Gignac gets up above Marquinhos to power home the opening goal for Marseille after half an hour. Blaise Matuidi is congratulated by his team-mates after bringing PSG level with a superb curling effort from the edge of the box. Gignac fires home his second goal past Salvatore Sirigu after a mistake from Marco Veratti gave him a clear run on goal, to make it 2-1. Marquinhos jumps for joy after slamming the ball into the roof of the net to make it 2-2 after Zlatan Ibrahimovic's mis-hit free kick. Ibrahimovic put pressure on Jeremy Morel to force an own goal just two minutes later, as PSG went ahead for the first time in the game. Marseille: Mandanda, Romao, Fanni, Morel, Lemina, Dja Djédjé, Mendy, Payet, Thauvin (Ocampos 63 mins), Gignac (Batshuayi 71), Ayew (Alessandrini 72) Subs not used: Aloe, N'Koulou, Samba, Tuiloma. Goals: Gignac 30, 43. Booked: Romao, Fanni, Ayew, Gignac. PSG: Sirigu, Marquinhos, Thiago Silva, David Luiz (Van der Wiel 34), Maxwell, Verratti, Motta, Matuidi, Pastore (Rabiot 82), Ibrahimovic, Cavani (Lavezzi 59),. Subs not used: Douchez, Cabaye, Bahebeck, Digne. Goals: Matuidi 35 Marquinhos 49, Morel OG 51. Booked: Veratti, Pastore. In the end it was PSG who ran out winners, but they twice had to come from behind to see off their fierce rivals in a game that had passion, quality, and goals aplenty. The game was decided by a 130-second burst soon after the half-time break, in which the visitors came from 2-1 down to go 3-2 ahead, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic, predictably, involved in both goals, though not perhaps, in the way that would be expected. First the Swedish star slipped as he struck a free kick at goal, only to see his nothing effort land at the feet of Brazilian defender Marquinhos, who slammed the ball into the roof of the net from close range. Just two minutes later Ibrahimovic might have been on hand to tap home Javier Pastore's low cross, but in the end his presence was enough to force defender Jeremy Morel to divert it past his own goalkeeper. It felt harsh on Marseille, who were the better side for large periods, but they were let down by defensive frailties and an inability to really punhish the PSG backline. Despite the hosts dominance of possession, the champions could easily have won this by three or four goals, such were their chances. Ibrahimovic had several excellent opportunities, the last of which saw Steve Mandanda pull off a remarkable save, while Pastore should have scored at least once, and Mandanda also did well to deny Matuidi late on. All of that without considering the chances the visitors missed before falling behind in the first half, with Ibrahimovic denied a penalty following a clumsy tackle by Morel, Pastore firing wide when clean through, and the woefully out of form Edinson Cavani scuffing a volley straight at the keeper after being picked out by a beautiful chipped pass. Zlatan Ibrahimovic (left) challenges for the ball against Jeremy Morel in the crucial top of the table clash in Ligue 1 on Easter Sunday. Dimitri Payet gets a shot away under pressure from Marco Veratti of PSG in the Stade Veledrome as Marseille looked to take home advantage. On the other hand it is difficult to remember Salvatore Sirigu making too many meaningful saves in the second half, although he did acrobatically tip a Gignac header over the bar shortly before the break to deny the striker a hat-trick. With Lyon having briefly gone top of the table by beating Guingamp earlier in the weekend, it was a game both sides really needed to win to keep up their title challenges. The result puts Laurent Blanc's men top of Ligue 1 again, and is a serious dent to Marseille's hopes. It all looked so different at half time, when an Andre-Pierre Gignac double had his side 2-1 up. The local-born hero first rose above Marquinhos at the back post to head past Sirigu on the half-hour, before slotting past the Italian shortly before half time to restore the lead. Both goals had an element of fortune, with Gignac climbing all over his defender to convert Dimitri Payet's cross, and Marco Veratti gifting him possession through on goal for the second, but nonetheless he took both well. In between was the pick of the goals, a stunner from Blaise Matuidi, who cut inside beautifully, before curling in from the edge of the box, via the fingertips of Mandanda and the inside of the post. PSG's win was marred only by an injury to David Luiz, withdrawn in the first half with what looked like a hamstring pull. But a win over their fierce rivals, and the return to the table's summit, will soften that blow. David Luiz is brought down, and the Brazilian defender was forced off soon after with a hamstring injury which looked serious. Marseille took the lead twice in the first half, but on both occasions they were unable to stay ahead for too long. Gignac celebrates his second goal, and the Marseille striker was only denied his hat-trick by an acrobatic save from Sirigu. Ibrahimovic looks on unimpressed during a difficult first half for the French champions, but his side kept responding to going behind. Marquihos wheels away after scoring his goal, which made the score 2-2 early in the second half, and changed the momentum of the game. The fiery atmosphere bubbled over late on, as Ezequiel Lavezzi was targeted with missiles and laser pointers while trying to take a corner. The home fans produced a passionate atmosphere in the cauldron of the Veledrome as they pursued the French title against their rivals.

Andre-Pierre Gignac puts Marseille ahead on half-hour with powerful back-post header from Dimitri Payet cross. Blaise Matuidi equalises five minutes later with a stunning strike from the edge of the box. Gignac capitalises on terrible PSG defending to restore Marseille's lead before half time. Marquinhos brings PSG level again, before Jeremy Morel own goal puts champions ahead moments later.

Article: (CNN)Never mind cats having nine lives. A stray pooch in Washington State has used up at least three of her own after being hit by a car, apparently whacked on the head with a hammer in a misguided mercy killing and then buried in a field -- only to survive. That's according to Washington State University, where the dog -- a friendly white-and-black bully breed mix now named Theia -- has been receiving care at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital. Four days after her apparent death, the dog managed to stagger to a nearby farm, dirt-covered and emaciated, where she was found by a worker who took her to a vet for help. She was taken in by Moses Lake, Washington, resident Sara Mellado. "Considering everything that she's been through, she's incredibly gentle and loving," Mellado said, according to WSU News. "She's a true miracle dog and she deserves a good life." Theia is only one year old but the dog's brush with death did not leave her unscathed. She suffered a dislocated jaw, leg injuries and a caved-in sinus cavity -- and still requires surgery to help her breathe. The veterinary hospital's Good Samaritan Fund committee awarded some money to help pay for the dog's treatment, but Mellado has set up a fundraising page to help meet the remaining cost of the dog's care. She's also created a Facebook page to keep supporters updated. Donors have already surpassed the $10,000 target, inspired by Theia's tale of survival against the odds. On the fundraising page, Mellado writes, "She is in desperate need of extensive medical procedures to fix her nasal damage and reset her jaw. I agreed to foster her until she finally found a loving home." She is dedicated to making sure Theia gets the medical attention she needs, Mellado adds, and wants to "make sure she gets placed in a family where this will never happen to her again!" Any additional funds raised will be "paid forward" to help other animals. Theia is not the only animal to apparently rise from the grave in recent weeks. A cat in Tampa, Florida, found seemingly dead after he was hit by a car in January, showed up alive in a neighbor's yard five days after he was buried by his owner. The cat was in bad shape, with maggots covering open wounds on his body and a ruined left eye, but remarkably survived with the help of treatment from the Humane Society.

Article: Liverpool vice-captain Jordan Henderson thinks his side could catch Manchester City in the Barclays Premier League having fought through a tough and long season at Anfield. Henderson and Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet both played their 47th game of season in the 2-0 win over Newcastle United on Monday night, equalling the record for appearances by any player in the top five European leagues so far this campaign. But the England midfielder believes that after finding winning form again following poor results against Manchester United and Arsenal, Liverpool can pile the pressure on to City who sit four points above them in the race for the Champions League. Liverpool vice-captain Jordan Henderson thinks his side could catch Manchester City in the  Premier League. Henderson played his 47th game of season in the 2-0 win over Newcastle United on Monday night. Manchester City have been faltering and lost 4-2 at Manchester United, Liverpool are four points behind. 'We knew it was an important game for us,' Henderson said 'Obviously the last couple of weeks in the Premier League have been disappointing both with performances and results. We knew today we needed to put that right and I think we did that with a great result for us. 'We've got ground to make up but we'll just keep going, keep winning in games and putting in performances. Come the end of the season, you never know.' Raheem Sterling pulled off some fine skill to open the scoring in the ninth minute at Anfield before Joe Allen capitalised on a defensive mistake to score his first Anfield goal with 20 minutes to go. Raheem Sterling pulled off some fine skill to open the scoring in the ninth minute at Anfield on Monday night. Joe Allen capitalised on a defensive mistake to score his first Anfield goal to make it 2-0 with 20 minutes to go. 'It was great to get that goal to give us that two-goal cushion,' Allen said. 'It wasn't my best game but I got the goal and helped the team. It was important after the defeats.' Newcastle had what looked a strong shout for a penalty when Dejan Lovren appeared to foul Ayoze Perez in the area, and Allen admitted he thought it was a spot-kick. 'I did get a good view of it as I'd missed the ball in the build-up,' he said. 'It look a good shout for a penalty, but I didn't get one the other night. These things happen.' Liverpool's players congratulate Allen on his goal that secured another vital win in the Premier League battle.

Liverpool beat Newcastle United 2-0 at Anfield on Monday night. The win moved them to within four points of fourth-place Manchester City. Jordan Henderson has played a Europe-wide record 47 games this season. But he hopes Liverpool have staying power to put pressure on City.

Article: (CNN)If you've been following the news lately, there are certain things you doubtless know about Mohammad Javad Zarif. He is, of course, the Iranian foreign minister. He has been U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's opposite number in securing a breakthrough in nuclear discussions that could lead to an end to sanctions against Iran -- if the details can be worked out in the coming weeks. And he received a hero's welcome as he arrived in Iran on a sunny Friday morning. "Long live Zarif," crowds chanted as his car rolled slowly down the packed street. You may well have read that he is "polished" and, unusually for one burdened with such weighty issues, "jovial." An Internet search for "Mohammad Javad Zarif" and "jovial" yields thousands of results. He certainly has gone a long way to bring Iran in from the cold and allow it to rejoin the international community. But there are some facts about Zarif that are less well-known. Here are six:. In September 2013, Zarif tweeted "Happy Rosh Hashanah," referring to the Jewish New Year. That prompted Christine Pelosi, the daughter of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, to respond with a tweet of her own: "Thanks. The New Year would be even sweeter if you would end Iran's Holocaust denial, sir." And, perhaps to her surprise, Pelosi got a response. "Iran never denied it," Zarif tweeted back. "The man who was perceived to be denying it is now gone. Happy New Year." The reference was likely to former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who had left office the previous month. Zarif was nominated to be foreign minister by Ahmadinejad's successor, Hassan Rouhami. His foreign ministry notes, perhaps defensively, that "due to the political and security conditions of the time, he decided to continue his education in the United States." That is another way of saying that he was outside the country during the demonstrations against the Shah of Iran, which began in 1977, and during the Iranian Revolution, which drove the shah from power in 1979. Zarif left the country in 1977, received his undergraduate degree from San Francisco State University in 1981, his master's in international relations from the University of Denver in 1984 and his doctorate from the University of Denver in 1988. Both of his children were born in the United States. The website of the Iranian Foreign Ministry, which Zarif runs, cannot even agree with itself on when he was born. The first sentence of his official biography, perhaps in a nod to the powers that be in Tehran, says Zarif was "born to a religious traditional family in Tehran in 1959." Later on the same page, however, his date of birth is listed as January 8, 1960. And the Iranian Diplomacy website says he was born in in 1961. So he is 54, 55 or maybe even 56. Whichever, he is still considerably younger than his opposite number, Kerry, who is 71. The feds investigated him over his alleged role in controlling the Alavi Foundation, a charitable organization. The U.S. Justice Department said the organization was secretly run on behalf of the Iranian government to launder money and get around U.S. sanctions. But last year, a settlement in the case, under which the foundation agreed to give a 36-story building in Manhattan along with other properties to the U.S. government, did not mention Zarif's name. Early in the Iranian Revolution, Zarif was among the students who took over the Iranian Consulate in San Francisco. The aim, says the website Iranian.com -- which cites Zarif's memoirs, titled "Mr. Ambassador" -- was to expel from the consulate people who were not sufficiently Islamic. Later, the website says, Zarif went to make a similar protest at the Iranian mission to the United Nations. In response, the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations offered him a job. In fact, he has now spent more time with Kerry than any other foreign minister in the world. And that amount of quality time will only increase as the two men, with help from other foreign ministers as well, try to meet a June 30 deadline for nailing down the details of the agreement they managed to outline this week in Switzerland.

Article: (CNN)Five Americans who were monitored for three weeks at an Omaha, Nebraska, hospital after being exposed to Ebola in West Africa have been released, a Nebraska Medicine spokesman said in an email Wednesday. One of the five had a heart-related issue on Saturday and has been discharged but hasn't left the area, Taylor Wilson wrote. The others have already gone home. They were exposed to Ebola in Sierra Leone in March, but none developed the deadly virus. They are clinicians for Partners in Health, a Boston-based aid group. They all had contact with a colleague who was diagnosed with the disease and is being treated at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. As of Monday, that health care worker is in fair condition. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta has said the last of 17 patients who were being monitored are expected to be released by Thursday. More than 10,000 people have died in a West African epidemic of Ebola that dates to December 2013, according to the World Health Organization. Almost all the deaths have been in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Ebola is spread by direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person.

Article: Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina has a Premier League win ratio of 91.7 per cent - the highest of any player to have made at least 10 appearances. Following the Gunners' 1-0 win against Burnley at Turf Moor on Saturday, the Colombia international took his tally to 11 wins from 12 games since he displaced Wojciech Szczesny as No 1 in January. Ospina has kept six clean sheets in those 12 games with his only defeat coming against Tottenham in the north London derby on February 7 to boast an impressive win percentage. But who else makes the top 10? Ospina has the highest win ratio of any Premier League player to make more than 10 appearances. The Arsenal goalkeeper has won 11 of his 12 games in the league since displacing Wojciech Szczesny. Former Manchester City defender Stefan Savic (right) won 10 of his 11 games in the league before being sold. Former Manchester City defender Stefan Savic, who was deemed not good enough after making just 11 Premier League appearances before being sold to Fiorentina, is second behind Ospina. The Montenegro international has a win ratio of 90.9 per cent after appearing on the losing side just once during his only season with the Premier League champions. Gerard Pique, who spent four years at Manchester United, makes up the top three after winning 10 of his 12 Premier League games before rejoining Barcelona and going on to win countless trophies, including a World Cup with Spain. Gerard Pique made 12 Premier League appearances for Manchester United, winning 10 of them. Arjen Robben posts an impressive 82.1 per cent win ration in the Premier League from 67 matches. Asier del Horno won 20 times during his only season in the Premier League with Chelsea in 2005-06. Arjen Robben has arguably the most impressive stats of any player on the list for the number of appearances he made for Chelsea during a three-year spell. The Bayern Munich winger was on the winning side an incredible 55 times from his 67 games giving him a win ration of 82.1 per cent. Another former Chelsea player Asier del Horno is fifth on the list with 80 per cent and is followed by current Arsenal right back Hector Bellerin with 78.6. Arsenal right back Hector Bellerin (left) has won 11 of his 14 league games this season. Manchester United forward James Wilson has won 10 of 13 appearances in the league. Igor Stepanov made 17 appearances for Arsenal in the early 2000s and won 13 matches. Manchester United's 19-year-old striker James Wilson has only failed to be on the winning side three times from his 13 appearances putting him seventh on the list, while former Arsenal defender Igor Stepanovs' 76.5 per cent is enough to put him eighth. Nacho Monreal, currently preferred to Kieran Gibbs as Arsenal left back, has won 43 games from his 57 appearances for Arsene Wenger's side. United defender Paddy McNair sneaks into the top 10 with 75 per cent having featured 12 times under Louis van Gaal this season, winning nine. When did Ospina join Arsenal? Arsenal signed Ospina from Ligue 1 side Nice last summer. The 26-year-old made close to 200 appearances for the French club during six seasons. How much did Arsenal pay for him? Originally signed as back-up and competition for Wojciech Szczesny after the Gunners No 2 Lukasz Fabianski joined Swansea, Ospina cost a paltry £3million. Is he of international calibre? Ospina had won 52 caps for Colombia and impressed during their run to the World Cup quarter-final in Brazil last summer. When did Ospina make his first appearance for Arsenal? Ospina made his debut for Arsenal in a 2-1 defeat by Southampton in the third round of the Capital One Cup back in September and only made one further appearance in the Champions League before 2015. When did he displace Wojciech Szczesny as No 1? Ospina was recalled to the starting line-up as Arsenal beat Hull 2-0 in the FA Cup third round in January after Szczesny was at fault for both goals during a 2-0 defeat by Southampton. It later emerged that the Poland goalkeeper was caught smoking in the showers after the game. Ospina kept his place for the league game the following week and has played every Premier League match since. Did you know...

Article: (CNN)A Duke student has admitted to hanging a noose made of rope from a tree near a student union, university officials said Thursday. The prestigious private school didn't identify the student, citing federal privacy laws. In a news release, it said the student was no longer on campus and will face student conduct review. The student was identified during an investigation by campus police and the office of student affairs and admitted to placing the noose on the tree early Wednesday, the university said. Officials are still trying to determine if other people were involved. Criminal investigations into the incident are ongoing as well. Students and faculty members marched Wednesday afternoon chanting "We are not afraid. We stand together,"  after pictures of the noose were passed around on social media. At a forum held on the steps of Duke Chapel, close to where the noose was discovered at 2 a.m., hundreds of people gathered. "You came here for the reason that you want to say with me, 'This is no Duke we will accept. This is no Duke we want. This is not the Duke we're here to experience. And this is not the Duke we're here to create,' " Duke President Richard Brodhead told the crowd. The incident is one of several recent racist events to affect college students. Last month a fraternity at the University of Oklahoma had its charter removed after a video surfaced showing members using the N-word and referring to lynching in a chant. Two students were expelled. In February, a noose was hung around the neck of a statue of a famous civil rights figure at the University of Mississippi. A statement issued by Duke said there was a previous report of hate speech directed at students on campus. In the news release, the vice president for student affairs called the noose incident a "cowardly act."

Article: Andre Ayew is keen on a move to Liverpool this summer. The Ghana international will be a free agent as he is out of contract at Marseille and wants to join the Anfield club who he supported as a boy. Everton, Newcastle and Swansea have all shown interest while Ayew's representatives have held talks with Roma. Wolfsburg, Borussia Dortmund and Napoli are also keen to speak to him. Ayew, 25, was born in France but followed his father Abedi Pele by playing for Ghana where he has become one of their star performers notably scoring in the World Cup finals last summer against USA and eventual winners Germany. Andre Ayew is out of contract at Marseille in the summer and is keen on a move to England. The Ghana international admits he supported Liverpool as a boy and would like to play for the Anfield club. Although emotionally attached to Marseille, he admits he is seeking a new challenge and is ready to test himself in the Premier League. Talking to Sportsmail, he said: 'I'm a Marseille boy, I love Marseille, the club, the fans, the area, it's a great place to play football and I will continue to speak to them but it's true I'd like to play in England.' Ayew, who is represented in England by agent Mark McKay of ExcelFoot, added: 'I grew up watching English football and I support Liverpool. Steven Gerrard is my favourite player. They have always had exciting teams and now they are a club that likes to play with pace and give chances to young players. Ayew's favourite player growing up was Steven Gerrard, who will leave Liverpool at the end of the season. A player he knew from their time together at Marseille, Ayew speaks regularly to Joey Barton (right) 'I'm 25 now and it is a good age for me to take the next step in my career. I have offers from England, Italy and Germany but it would be unfair to say who from. I speak to my friends such as Morgan Amalfitano at West Ham and Joey Barton at QPR and they always talk well about the league and the atmosphere. 'I have been fortunate to experience Stamford Bridge and Old Trafford in the Champions League but I want to play at Anfield and other grounds. 'I know my quality. I have shown I can play at Marseille and I have taken on responsibility with my country. It's important that you always strive to be better. You see with players such as Eden Hazard how hard they work and I believe in hard work to get better. It's easy to talk though, what is important is that I do it.' The Ghana international is also being looked at by Swansea, Newcastle and Everton in the Premier League. Liverpool have already secured the signing of Divock Origi (left), who will move to Anfield in the summer. Ayew's ideal is to help Marseille win the French league but it will be difficult as they trail leaders Paris Saint-Germain by five points. 'I will fight to the end for Marseille then I will make my decision. It is an important step for me.' Liverpool already have Divock Origi in the bag and are keen on Burnley's Danny Ings but will be enthused that a player of Ayew's pedigree has such desire to play for them. Failure to reach the Champions League could also mean he falls within their budget as a free transfer. Brendan Rodgers wants a goalkeeper, midfielder and a full-back as well as a forward. He likes Memphis Depay at PSV Eindhoven but the Holland international is expected to join Manchester United.

Article: (CNN)He's a blue chip college basketball recruit. She's a high school freshman with Down syndrome. At first glance Trey Moses and Ellie Meredith couldn't be more different. But all that changed Thursday when Trey asked Ellie to be his prom date. Trey -- a star on Eastern High School's basketball team in Louisville, Kentucky, who's headed to play college ball next year at Ball State -- was originally going to take his girlfriend to Eastern's prom. So why is he taking Ellie instead? "She's great... she listens and she's easy to talk to" he said. Trey made the prom-posal (yes, that's what they are calling invites to prom these days) in the gym during Ellie's P.E. class. Trina Helson, a teacher at Eastern, alerted the school's newspaper staff to the prom-posal and posted photos of Trey and Ellie on Twitter that have gone viral. She wasn't surpristed by Trey's actions. "That's the kind of person Trey is," she said. To help make sure she said yes, Trey entered the gym armed with flowers and a poster that read "Let's Party Like it's 1989," a reference to the latest album by Taylor Swift, Ellie's favorite singer. Trey also got the OK from Ellie's parents the night before via text. They were thrilled. "You just feel numb to those moments raising a special needs child,"  said Darla Meredith, Ellie's mom. "You first feel the need to protect and then to overprotect." Darla Meredith said Ellie has struggled with friendships since elementary school, but a special program at Eastern called Best Buddies had made things easier for her. She said Best Buddies cultivates friendships between students with and without developmental disabilities and prevents students like Ellie from feeling isolated and left out of social functions. "I guess around middle school is when kids started to care about what others thought," she said, but "this school, this year has been a relief." Trey's future coach at Ball State, James Whitford, said he felt great about the prom-posal, noting that Trey, whom he's known for a long time, often works with other kids. Trey's mother, Shelly Moses, was also proud of her son. "It's exciting to bring awareness to a good cause," she said. "Trey has worked pretty hard, and he's a good son." Both Trey and Ellie have a lot of planning to do. Trey is looking to take up special education as a college major, in addition to playing basketball in the fall. As for Ellie, she can't stop thinking about prom. "Ellie can't wait to go dress shopping" her mother said. "Because I've only told about a million people!" Ellie interjected.

Article: These are the horrific final moments of a 44-year-old suspect who was apparently accidentally shot dead by a 73-year-old reserve deputy last week after he fired his handgun instead of his Taser. In the footage, released by police, deputies are filmed chasing after Eric Harris, first by car then on foot, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on April 2 after he fled during a sting operation in a nearby parking lot. Once they catch up to Harris, they tackle him to the ground and order him to lie on his stomach. Robert Bates then yells, 'Taser! Taser!' - but takes out his service weapon and pulls the trigger. After firing one round into Harris, the former full-time officer drops his gun from the recoil and says in shock: 'Oh, I shot him! I'm sorry.' Harris then starts yelping on the ground, while pleading for help. WARNING: GRAPHIC VIDEO. Chase: This newly-released video of Eric Harris's fatal shooting shows deputies chasing after Harris, first by car then on foot, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on April 2 after he fled during a sting operation in a nearby parking lot. Fleeing: The deputies run after Harris, who was allegedly caught trying to buy drugs and a gun from cops. View from the ground: Once they catch up to Harris, they tackle him to the ground and order him to lie on his stomach. Robert Bates then yells, 'Taser! Taser!' (pictured) - but takes out his handgun and pulls the trigger. The fatally-wounded man, who is being held down by his neck by the deputies, exclaims: 'Oh my god, he shot me! He shot me! He shot me, man.' He then adds: 'Oh, my god. I'm losing my breath.' Shockingly, one of the deputies replies: 'F*** your breath.' Another calls Harris, who is black and dressed in shorts and a T-shirt, a'motherf***er' and tells him: 'You shouldn't have f***ing ran.' Following the incident, during which the deputies do not appear to realize Harris has been fatally injured and even tell him to'shut the f*** up', the suspect was hospitalized. He died an hour later. The footage, obtained by NewsOn6, comes as a number of US shootings  involving police officers and  black suspects have hit the headlines. Many of the suspects were unarmed at the time. In the April 2 incident, Bates accidentally fired his gun thinking that he had pulled out his Taser - as proved by the fact he did not expect the weapon to recoil, the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office said. Bates, who had been monitoring the situation from afar, ran up to Harris in a bid 'to get the situation under control', before mistakenly firing his gun instead of his Taser, according to on-site deputies. Apology: After firing one round into Harris, the former full-time officer drops his gun from the recoil and says in shock: 'Oh, I shot him! I'm sorry' (pictured) Harris then starts yelping on the ground, while shouting, 'Help!' Shooting: This photo shows a deputy bending down to pick up Bates's dropped gun following the 'accidental' shooting in Tulsa earlier this month. Harris is being held down on the ground, out of shot, by other deputies. Terrified: The fatally-wounded man, who is being held by his neck and back by the deputies (pictured), says: 'Oh my god, he shot me! He shot me! He shot me, man.' He then adds: 'Oh, my god. I'm losing my breath' Suspect: Shockingly, one of the deputies replies: 'F*** your breath.' Another calls Harris (pictured in a police mug shot released d by officials on April 4) a'motherf***er' and tells him: 'You shouldn't have f***ing ran' Harris, who was being restrained at the time, had  allegedly fled after he was caught trying to buy drugs and a gun from deputies posing as dealers in the parking lot of a nearby dollar store. Major Shannon Clark told CNN: 'They were struggling trying to get him into custody, he ran up trying to use a less lethal device, trying to get the situation under control. 'Inadvertently he discharged a round from his service weapon.' He added: 'Did an accident happen? Sure. But is it accredited to his age? Or was it accredited to the rapidly evolving situation? I guess that will be determined in the investigation.' Bates, who has been a reserve since 2008, is the chief executive of Robert C Bates LLC, a Tulsa-based insurance company, who worked as an officer assigned to the Violent Crimes Task Force. Fatal: Following the incident, during which the deputies told Harris to'shut the f*** up', the suspect was hospitalized. He died an hour later. Above, blood appears to be running down Harris's arm at the scene. Scene: In this photo, which has been partially blanked out by the Sheriff's Office, deputies are pictured at the scene of the incident. The deputy in the foreground of the frame is holding down Harris following the shooting. He has also spent time with the Tulsa Police Auxiliary. Speaking to local site News OK, Bates said: 'It was me. My attorney has advised me not to comment. As much as I would like to, I can’t.' According to Tulsa Police, Harris had met an undercover officer to sell him a 9 mm semi-automatic pistol and 300 rounds ammunition. He fled the scene when deputies tried to arrest him, it is alleged. The suspect then fought with another deputy when he was shot, police said. He was gunned down accidentally by Bates after officers 'observed him reaching for his waistband area... causing concern for the deputies' safety,' authorities told CNN. Officers had been monitoring Harris as part of an investigation into the trade of methamphetamine. As he met with undercover deputies to allegedly hand over the drugs, he is accused of offering to throw in a sawed-off gun. Confusion: Bates, 73, accidentally grabbed his pistol and shot Harris (right, in a previous mug shot) dead, according to Tulsa police. Bates is classified as an advanced deputy. The incident is now under investigation. His convictions include escaping prison in 1990, robbery with a dangerous weapon in 1999, and making threatening phone calls. According to Tulsa Police, Harris' killer, Bates, is classified as an advanced deputy. Reserves are 'basic', 'intermediate', or 'advanced'. The qualify for 'advanced', officers are required to have a minimum of 320 hours of training and 25 hours of training a year. During the annual field training program, they are tested on how to use and identify lethal and non-lethal weapons. With the same power as paid deputies, reserves can conduct their own investigations, make arrests and work on task forces. The cause of Harris's death is under investigation.

Article: (CNN)Governments around the world are using the threat of terrorism -- real or perceived -- to advance executions, Amnesty International alleges in its annual report on the death penalty. "The dark trend of governments using the death penalty in a futile attempt to tackle real or imaginary threats to state security and public safety was stark last year," said Salil Shetty, Amnesty's Secretary General in a release. "It is shameful that so many states around the world are essentially playing with people's lives -- putting people to death for 'terrorism' or to quell internal instability on the ill-conceived premise of deterrence." The report, "Death Sentences and Executions 2014," cites the example of Pakistan lifting a six-year moratorium on the execution of civilians following the horrific attack on a school in Peshawar in December. China is also mentioned, as having used the death penalty as a tool in its "Strike Hard" campaign against terrorism in the restive far-western province of Xinjiang. The annual report catalogs the use of state-sanctioned killing as a punitive measure across the globe, and this year's edition contains some mixed findings. On one hand, the number of executions worldwide has gone down by almost 22% on the previous year. At least 607 people were executed around the world in 2014, compared to 778 in 2013. Amnesty's figures do not include statistics on executions carried out in China, where information on the practice is regarded as a state secret. Belarus and Vietnam, too, do not release data on death penalty cases. "The long-term trend is definitely positive -- we are seeing a decrease in the number of executions (worldwide)," Audrey Gaughran, Amnesty's Director of Global Issues, told CNN. "A number of countries are closer to abolition, and there are some signs that some countries will be abolitionist by 2015. (There are) signals of a world that is nearing abolition." While the report notes some encouraging signs, it also highlights a marked increase in the number of people sentenced to death in 2014. At least 2,466 people globally are confirmed to have been handed the sentence last year, an increase of 28% compared with 2013. The report notes that the spike in sentencing is attributable to mass-sentencing in countries including Egypt and Nigeria, "against scores of people in some cases." The organization found "positive developments" worldwide, with most regions seeming to show reductions in the number of executions. Opinion: Sharp spike in death sentences. Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, saw a 28% fall in reported cases, and executions recorded in the Middle East and North Africa were down 23% compared to 2013. "Even though we've highlighted some of the negative developments... I think we would always highlight that there are positive developments," Gaughran said. "Across the board, with the exception of Europe and Central Asia there were fewer reports of executions in every region." The resumption of the use of capital punishment in Belarus -- the only country in Europe and Central Asia to execute people -- after a two year hiatus spoiled an near-universal decrease in countries using the death penalty by region. The United States has the dubious distinction of being the only country in the Americas to conduct executions, but the number of convicts put to death here fell slightly, from 39 in 2013 to 35 in 2014. The state of Washington also imposed a moratorium on executions last year. The U.S. remains one of the worst offenders for imposing capital punishment, with only Iran (289+), Iraq (61+), and Saudi Arabia (90+) executing more people in 2014. While figures are not available, Amnesty estimates that China also executes "thousands" of prisoners each year, "more than the rest of the world put together." The report also highlights the imperfections in the judiciary processes that lead to many sentenced to death. "In the majority of countries where people were sentenced to death or executed, the death penalty was imposed after proceedings that did not meet international fair trial standards," the report stated. "In 2014 Amnesty International raised particular concerns in relation to court proceedings in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, China, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Sri Lanka." The United Nations Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, last year stressed the need to move toward abolition of capital punishment. "The taking of life is too irreversible for one human being to inflict it on another," he said, in marking World Day against Death Penalty in October. "We must continue to argue strongly that the death penalty is unjust and incompatible with fundamental human rights." Amnesty estimates that at least 19,094 people were believed to be on death row at the end of 2014.

Amnesty International's annual report on the death penalty states that governments around the world are using the threat of terrorism as an excuse to execute people, with Pakistan and China being cited as examples, and while the number of executions worldwide has

Article: She captured hearts across the nation as she realized her dream to play for Mount St. Joseph's women's basketball team in Ohio and raised $1.5million - all while battling inoperable brain cancer. And one of the millions Lauren Hill touched was LeBron James, who posted an emotional farewell letter to the teenager via Twitter on Friday, just hours after she passed away from her rare tumor. In the letter, the basketball star, dubbed King James, praised the 19-year-old for the 'leadership', 'courage' and'strength' she had shown while suffering from Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG). James, 30, who had never actually met Lauren, wrote: 'Dear Lauren Hill, You are the true definition of strength, courage, power, leadership, etc etc! Your time spent on earth will never be forgotten. Scroll down for video. Farewell: LeBron James (left) posted an emotional farewell letter to Lauren Hill via Twitter on Friday, just hours after the teenager passed away from terminal brain cancer. Right, Lauren plays college basketball last year. Praise: In the letter, James, 30, who had never actually met Lauren, wrote: 'Dear Lauren Hill, You are the true definition of strength, courage, power, leadership, etc etc! Your time spent on earth will never be forgotten' 'You inspired me': He continued: 'I [hate] that I never got the chance to meet u in person but know you inspired me the whole time! For every life u touched, u made the biggest impact [on] them by just being YOU!! 'I [hate] that I never got the chance to meet u in person but know you inspired me the whole time! For every life u touched, u made the biggest impact [on] them by just being YOU!! 'You're in a far better place now and please don't have too much fun up there w/o all your family and friends. Can u please tell my Grandma I said hello. 'Don't be afraid, she knows you cause we spoke about u plenty of times Until we officially meet again, take care and continue to be that LEADER we all love! ‪#‎RIPLaurenHill.' The Cleveland Cavaliers player signed off the letter - which was posted to his Twitter page - 'Sincerely, LeBron James'. The letter has since been retweeted tens of thousands of times. Many users have deemed the tribute 'touching' and 'beautiful'. One told James - who competed against the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday night - that it 'was so sweet it brought me to tears'. Lauren, who was diagnosed with a rare form of brain cancer shortly after her 18th birthday, had repeatedly defied doctors' expectations after they told her that she would not live past December. A touching tribute: James told Lauren not to have 'too much fun up there without all your family and friends' 'Tell my Grandma I said hello': He added that he had spoken 'plenty of times' about Lauren to his grandmother. #RIPLaurenHill: The Cleveland Cavaliers player signed off the letter - which was posted to his Twitter page - 'Sincerely, LeBron James' (pictured). The letter has since been retweeted tens of thousands of times. Instead, the Indiana native played four games with her team at Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati, and raised more than $1.5 million for research into the cancer she suffered from. But as her condition worsened, the teenager became an honorary coach and earlier this year, she moved to Cincinnati Children's Hospital. She passed away at the hospital on Friday morning. As news of her death became public, thousands of people across the country - both basketball fans and not - took to social media to express their sorrow at her death, and show support for her family. Only a year and a half ago, Lauren, whose cancer saw her rapidly gain weight, had been just another teenager preparing for college after deciding to play basketball for Mount St. Joseph. But a few weeks later, she started feeling dizzy while playing for her high school team in nearby Lawrenceburg, Indiana. Tests found her tumor and she was told she had less than two years left. Diagnosis: Lauren is pictured left in December 2013, and right, in December 2014, after her treatment for Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG), a rare childhood brain cancer which changed her appearance. Brave: Lauren, who used her limited energy to inspire people and raise money for research into the cancer that ultimately took her life, is pictured in her room in Cincinnati last December - months before she passed away. In September, doctors gave her the devastating news she wouldn't make it past December - and after years as a standout player, Lauren's hopes of playing college basketball were put in jeopardy. However, the NCAA granted permission to move the school's opening game forward because of her worsening condition. On November 2, Lauren realized her dream of playing for the school. Incredibly, she scored the first and last baskets of the team's 66-55 victory over Hiram College. Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a type of brain tumor found in the part of the brainstem at the lower back of the brain. Due to the tumor's location, it can cause double vision, difficulty controlling eye movement and facial expressions, and difficulty swallowing and chewing. It may also cause weakness in the limbs. The condition primarily affects children most often between the ages of four and nine. Between 100 and 150 new diagnoses are made a year in the U.S. Only 300 are made across North America and Europe a year. It can be treated with radiation, but chemotherapy is generally not effective and surgery is impossible due to the spread of the cancer into healthy tissue. Unlike with other childhood cancers, there has been little progress in improving treatments and cure rates for the condition over the last few decades. Fewer than 10 per cent of children with DIPG survive two years after their diagnosis. Source: DIPG Registry. 'It's a dream come true,' Lauren told reporters at the time. 'To play on a college court, to put my foot down on the floor and hear the roar of the crowd - I just love it so much. I love basketball. 'Everything that happened today was amazing. I'm truly happy, it's a really good day.' At the game, Lauren said she wanted to find a cure for the rare cancer, which has a less than 10 per cent survival rate and most often affects children aged four to nine. 'When I was diagnosed I remember kind of feeling lonely because nobody understood,' she said following the game, USA Today reported. 'And now that more people know about this story and the awareness of DIPG. 'I'm so happy that people know about it now and that we can get some research going and hopefully find that home run cure for cancer. And even though I'm probably not going to be around to see it, it's going to help a lot of people.' Lauren played in four games and made five layups before the spreading tumor made her stop. When the season ended, her team held its annual dinner in the hospital where Hill was being treated. She was also honored at local sporting events and was featured on a box of Wheaties - known as the Breakfast of Champions. The U.S. Basketball Writers Association voted her the Pat Summitt Most Courageous Award, which is normally awarded at the Final Four. Athletes from other colleges autographed No. 22 jerseys - her number - and sent them in support. As the cancer slowed her down, Lauren's family, friends and teammates took a bigger role in promoting her fundraising campaign - and she kept reminding everyone to appreciate life. 'Life is precious,' she told WKRC-TV before her death. 'Every moment you get with someone is a moment that's blessed, really blessed.' Final days: Lauren is pictured enjoying Easter (left) and St Patrick's Day (right) from hospital in Cincinnati. Fighter: The NCAA moved Mount St. Joseph's first basketball game forward last November (pictured) so that Lauren could achieve her dream of playing for collegiate basketball. She scored the first and last baskets. The co-founder of her nonprofit foundation confirmed Lauren's death in hospital on Friday. 'Through Lauren's fundraising and advocacy efforts, she not only became a spotlight on the lack of funding for cancer research, but she most certainly has become a beacon guiding researchers for years to come,' The Cure Starts Now co-founder Brooke Desserich said. Her nonprofit foundation helped to raise more than $1.5 million for cancer research. 'She's made an impact on the world, more so than me - more than I ever will do,' Lauren's coach Dan Benjamin said. 'I've gotten so many emails and phone calls from all over the world. People are contacting me because they want to share her story.' No information about a memorial has yet been released, but Lawrenceburg Schools superintendent Karl Galey said on Twitter that schools will be prepared to assist staff and students with counseling. Heroic: Lauren, pictured left, smiles at Pat Summitt after receiving the Pat Summitt Award during halftime of her first NCAA college basketball game in November last year. She went on to play four games for the school. Dear Lauren Hill,. You are the true definition of strength, courage, power, leadership, etc etc! Your time spent on earth will never be forgotten. I [hate] that I never got the chance to meet u in person but know you inspired me the whole time! For every life u touched, u made the biggest impact [on] them by just being YOU!!

Article: (CNN)Andrew Getty, one of the heirs to billions of oil money, appears to have died of natural causes, a Los Angeles Police Department spokesman said. The coroner's preliminary assessment is there was no foul play involved in the death of Getty, grandson of oil tycoon J. Paul Getty, said Detective Meghan Aguilar. Andrew Getty, 47, had "several health issues," Aguilar said, adding that an autopsy will be conducted. There is no criminal investigation underway, he said. Some medication had also been recovered from Getty's home, though investigators don't know whether Getty was taking it or what his medical history was, Ed Winter, assistant chief in the Los Angeles County coroner's office, told CNN affiliate KTLA Tuesday night. KTLA reported that Getty was found on his side near a bathroom in his home. Getty's parents, Ann and Gordon Getty, released a statement confirming their son's death and asking for privacy. Where the Getty family fortune came from. Gordon Getty is one of three living sons of J. Paul Getty, the oil baron who was thought to be the richest man in the world at the time of his death in 1976. Gordon Getty, 81, has a net worth of $2.1 billion, according to Forbes. One other son died in 1958 and another died in 1973. Gordon Getty spearheaded the controversial sale of Getty to Texaco for $10 billion in 1984. In its list of richest American families, Forbes estimated the Gettys' net worth to be about $5 billion. Court records show Andrew Getty had recently filed to get a restraining order against an ex-girlfriend. A hearing in the case had been scheduled for next week. In his request, Getty said he had been diagnosed with a serious medical condition in 2013. "A rise in my blood pressure places me in grave risk of substantial and irreparable injury or death," he wrote in the petition. "My doctors have advised that heated arguments can cause my blood pressure to rise dangerously." Andrew Getty had three brothers and three half-sisters. People we've lost in 2015. CNN's Doug Criss, Janet DiGiacomo, Mark Mooney, Mike Love, Julie In and Cheri Mossburg contributed to this report.

Article: Tony Pulis has discussed pre-season plans with Saido Berahino in an indication he plans to keep the striker beyond the summer transfer window. Berahino is likely to be away with Gareth Southgate’s England under 21 side in the Czech Republic until late June so Pulis has begun his preparations early. West Bromwich Albion were open to bids of £20million for Berahino in January and the 21-year-old has said he would leave to fulfil his desire to play in Champions League football. West Brom manager Tony Pulis has talked pre-season plans with Saido Berahino in an indication the England under 21 striker will remain at The Hawthorns beyond the summer. Berahino has been linked with a move away from West Brom after saying he wants to play European football. Pulis said: ‘Hopefully he's away with the under 21s so I have had a chat with him about pre-season and the time he'll have off but I haven't spoken about anything else to him. ‘I think the kid is happy here, he has played that way and certainly worked that way. We're more than happy to have him here because he has been very good.’ Berahino shares the same agent as Raheem Sterling, Aidy Ward, who was criticised by Brendan Rodgers over the Liverpool player’s contract stand-off. Pulis said: ‘Agents can have a massive influence on players in lots of respects. My argument to that is in the same in life, you get good agents and you get bad agents. Berahino is likely to be included in the England under 21 squad for this summer's European Championships. Berahino scored a vital goal in England's under 21 play-off with Croatia back in October.

Article: (CNN)Filipinos are being warned to be on guard for flash floods and landslides as tropical storm Maysak approached the Asian island nation Saturday. Just a few days ago, Maysak gained super typhoon status thanks to its sustained 150 mph winds. It has since lost a lot of steam as it has spun west in the Pacific Ocean. It's now classified as a tropical storm, according to the Philippine national weather service, which calls it a different name, Chedeng. It boasts steady winds of more than 70 mph (115 kph) and gusts up to 90 mph as of 5 p.m. (5 a.m. ET) Saturday. Still, that doesn't mean Maysak won't pack a wallop. Authorities took preemptive steps to keep people safe such as barring outdoor activities like swimming, surfing, diving and boating in some locales, as well as a number of precautionary evacuations. Gabriel Llave, a disaster official, told PNA that tourists who arrive Saturday in and around the coastal town of Aurora "will not be accepted by the owners of hotels, resorts, inns and the like... and will be advised to return to their respective places." Aldczar Aurelio, a meteorologist with the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), said the storm was centered 200 miles southwest of Aurora province as of 5 p.m. (5 a.m. ET) and heading west at a 12.5 mph clip. It's expected to make landfall Sunday morning on the southeastern coast of Isabela province and be out of the Philippines by Monday. Ahead of the storm. Isabela Gov. Faustino Dry III warned Saturday that residents should act as if this will be "no ordinary typhoon." Dry told PNA, "We do not know what the impact will be once it will make landfall."

Article: England suffered an injury scare at the start of their practice'match' here in St Kitts when Stuart Broad dramatically slipped in his delivery stride and was left clutching his ankle on the floor. Broad had complained about the state of the crease, which was damp after overnight rain, after bowling just three balls of his first over of the day at Warner Park. The groundsmen placed sand on the crease but from the very next delivery Broad slipped and went crashing to the ground, a blow which necessitated lengthy treatment before he left the field. Stuart Broad limps out of England's warm-up match in Saint Kitts after slipping over during his delivery. Broad looked to be in considerable pain after the fall and was accompanied by physio Craig de Weymam. Broad required lengthy treatment on the pitch after clutching his left ankle following his fall. Broad looked in some pain as he lay on the ground following his dramatic fall while bowling. The team's medical staff rushed out to the middle to treat Broad following his fall.

England there are no long-term effects but it is a concern for them with the first Test against West Indies starting on Monday in Antigua. It added to the sense of farce surrounding what has become a practice session rather than a second match against one of the worst teams England can ever have played. England attempted to make the most of a bad lot when they loaned Jonathan Trott, Gary Ballance and Jonny Bairstow to their opponents to give them additional practice. But the move backfired for Trott who edged Jimmy Anderson to third slip off just the third ball of the day and departed for a duck to follow the 72 he made on his return to England colours on Monday. Jonathan Trott, who had switched to the Saint Kitts team, was removed for a duck by James Anderson. Shane Jeffers of Saint Kitts is bowled by England's Ben Stokes on day one of the second warm-up match. Stokes celebrates with wicketkeeper Jos Buttler after taking the wicket of Jeffers.

Article: (CNN)For the first time in eight years, a TV legend returned to doing what he does best. Contestants told to "come on down!" on the April 1 edition of "The Price Is Right" encountered not host Drew Carey but another familiar face in charge of the proceedings. Instead, there was Bob Barker, who hosted the TV game show for 35 years before stepping down in 2007. Looking spry at 91, Barker handled the first price-guessing game of the show, the classic "Lucky Seven," before turning hosting duties over to Carey, who finished up.

Article: (CNN)Paul Walker is hardly the first actor to die during a production. But Walker's death in November 2013 at the age of 40 after a car crash was especially eerie given his rise to fame in the "Fast and Furious" film franchise. The release of "Furious 7" on Friday offers the opportunity for fans to remember -- and possibly grieve again -- the man that so many have praised as one of the nicest guys in Hollywood. "He was a person of humility, integrity, and compassion," military veteran Kyle Upham said in an email to CNN. Walker secretly paid for the engagement ring Upham shopped for with his bride. "We didn't know him personally but this was apparent in the short time we spent with him. I know that we will never forget him and he will always be someone very special to us," said Upham. The actor was on break from filming "Furious 7" at the time of the fiery accident, which also claimed the life of the car's driver, Roger Rodas. Producers said early on that they would not kill off Walker's character, Brian O'Connor, a former cop turned road racer. Instead, the script was rewritten and special effects were used to finish scenes, with Walker's brothers, Cody and Caleb, serving as body doubles. There are scenes that will resonate with the audience -- including the ending, in which the filmmakers figured out a touching way to pay tribute to Walker while "retiring" his character. At the premiere Wednesday night in Hollywood, Walker's co-star and close friend Vin Diesel gave a tearful speech before the screening, saying "This movie is more than a movie." "You'll feel it when you see it," Diesel said. "There's something emotional that happens to you, where you walk out of this movie and you appreciate everyone you love because you just never know when the last day is you're gonna see them." There have been multiple tributes to Walker leading up to the release. Diesel revealed in an interview with the "Today" show that he had named his newborn daughter after Walker. Social media has also been paying homage to the late actor. A week after Walker's death, about 5,000 people attended an outdoor memorial to him in Los Angeles. Most had never met him. Marcus Coleman told CNN he spent almost $1,000 to truck in a banner from Bakersfield for people to sign at the memorial. "It's like losing a friend or a really close family member... even though he is an actor and we never really met face to face," Coleman said. "Sitting there, bringing his movies into your house or watching on TV, it's like getting to know somebody. It really, really hurts." Walker's younger brother Cody told People magazine that he was initially nervous about how "Furious 7" would turn out, but he is happy with the film. "It's bittersweet, but I think Paul would be proud," he said. CNN's Paul Vercammen contributed to this report.

Article: These are the horrific final moments of a 44-year-old suspect who was apparently accidentally shot dead by a 73-year-old reserve deputy last week after he fired his handgun instead of his Taser. In the footage, released by police, deputies are filmed chasing after Eric Harris, first by car then on foot, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on April 2 after he fled during a sting operation in a nearby parking lot. Once they catch up to Harris, they tackle him to the ground and order him to lie on his stomach. Robert Bates then yells, 'Taser! Taser!' - but takes out his service weapon and pulls the trigger. After firing one round into Harris, the former full-time officer drops his gun from the recoil and says in shock: 'Oh, I shot him! I'm sorry.' Harris then starts yelping on the ground, while pleading for help. WARNING: GRAPHIC VIDEO. Chase: This newly-released video of Eric Harris's fatal shooting shows deputies chasing after Harris, first by car then on foot, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on April 2 after he fled during a sting operation in a nearby parking lot. Fleeing: The deputies run after Harris, who was allegedly caught trying to buy drugs and a gun from cops. View from the ground: Once they catch up to Harris, they tackle him to the ground and order him to lie on his stomach. Robert Bates then yells, 'Taser! Taser!' (pictured) - but takes out his handgun and pulls the trigger. The fatally-wounded man, who is being held down by his neck by the deputies, exclaims: 'Oh my god, he shot me! He shot me! He shot me, man.' He then adds: 'Oh, my god. I'm losing my breath.' Shockingly, one of the deputies replies: 'F*** your breath.' Another calls Harris, who is black and dressed in shorts and a T-shirt, a'motherf***er' and tells him: 'You shouldn't have f***ing ran.' Following the incident, during which the deputies do not appear to realize Harris has been fatally injured and even tell him to'shut the f*** up', the suspect was hospitalized. He died an hour later. The footage, obtained by NewsOn6, comes as a number of US shootings  involving police officers and  black suspects have hit the headlines. Many of the suspects were unarmed at the time. In the April 2 incident, Bates accidentally fired his gun thinking that he had pulled out his Taser - as proved by the fact he did not expect the weapon to recoil, the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office said. Bates, who had been monitoring the situation from afar, ran up to Harris in a bid 'to get the situation under control', before mistakenly firing his gun instead of his Taser, according to on-site deputies. Apology: After firing one round into Harris, the former full-time officer drops his gun from the recoil and says in shock: 'Oh, I shot him! I'm sorry' (pictured) Harris then starts yelping on the ground, while shouting, 'Help!' Shooting: This photo shows a deputy bending down to pick up Bates's dropped gun following the 'accidental' shooting in Tulsa earlier this month. Harris is being held down on the ground, out of shot, by other deputies. Terrified: The fatally-wounded man, who is being held by his neck and back by the deputies (pictured), says: 'Oh my god, he shot me! He shot me! He shot me, man.' He then adds: 'Oh, my god. I'm losing my breath' Suspect: Shockingly, one of the deputies replies: 'F*** your breath.' Another calls Harris (pictured in a police mug shot released d by officials on April 4) a'motherf***er' and tells him: 'You shouldn't have f***ing ran' Harris, who was being restrained at the time, had  allegedly fled after he was caught trying to buy drugs and a gun from deputies posing as dealers in the parking lot of a nearby dollar store. Major Shannon Clark told CNN: 'They were struggling trying to get him into custody, he ran up trying to use a less lethal device, trying to get the situation under control. 'Inadvertently he discharged a round from his service weapon.' He added: 'Did an accident happen? Sure. But is it accredited to his age? Or was it accredited to the rapidly evolving situation? I guess that will be determined in the investigation.' Bates, who has been a reserve since 2008, is the chief executive of Robert C Bates LLC, a Tulsa-based insurance company, who worked as an officer assigned to the Violent Crimes Task Force. Fatal: Following the incident, during which the deputies told Harris to'shut the f*** up', the suspect was hospitalized. He died an hour later. Above, blood appears to be running down Harris's arm at the scene. Scene: In this photo, which has been partially blanked out by the Sheriff's Office, deputies are pictured at the scene of the incident. The deputy in the foreground of the frame is holding down Harris following the shooting. He has also spent time with the Tulsa Police Auxiliary. Speaking to local site News OK, Bates said: 'It was me. My attorney has advised me not to comment. As much as I would like to, I can’t.' According to Tulsa Police, Harris had met an undercover officer to sell him a 9 mm semi-automatic pistol and 300 rounds ammunition. He fled the scene when deputies tried to arrest him, it is alleged. The suspect then fought with another deputy when he was shot, police said. He was gunned down accidentally by Bates after officers 'observed him reaching for his waistband area... causing concern for the deputies' safety,' authorities told CNN. Officers had been monitoring Harris as part of an investigation into the trade of methamphetamine. As he met with undercover deputies to allegedly hand over the drugs, he is accused of offering to throw in a sawed-off gun. Confusion: Bates, 73, accidentally grabbed his pistol and shot Harris (right, in a previous mug shot) dead, according to Tulsa police. Bates is classified as an advanced deputy. The incident is now under investigation. His convictions include escaping prison in 1990, robbery with a dangerous weapon in 1999, and making threatening phone calls. According to Tulsa Police, Harris' killer, Bates, is classified as an advanced deputy. Reserves are 'basic', 'intermediate', or 'advanced'. The qualify for 'advanced', officers are required to have a minimum of 320 hours of training and 25 hours of training a year. During the annual field training program, they are tested on how to use and identify lethal and non-lethal weapons. With the same power as paid deputies, reserves can conduct their own investigations, make arrests and work on task forces. The cause of Harris's death is under investigation.

Article: (CNN)Seventy years ago, Anne Frank died of typhus in a Nazi concentration camp at the age of 15. Just two weeks after her supposed death on March 31, 1945, the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp where she had been imprisoned was liberated -- timing that showed how close the Jewish diarist had been to surviving the Holocaust. But new research released by the Anne Frank House shows that Anne and her older sister, Margot Frank, died at least a month earlier than previously thought. Researchers re-examined archives of the Red Cross, the International Training Service and the Bergen-Belsen Memorial, along with testimonies of survivors. They concluded that Anne and Margot probably did not survive to March 1945 -- contradicting the date of death which had previously been determined by Dutch authorities. In 1944, Anne and seven others hiding in the Amsterdam secret annex were arrested and sent to the  Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. Anne Frank's final entry. That same year, Anne and Margot were separated from their mother and sent away to work as slave labor at the Bergen-Belsen camp in Germany. Days at the camp were filled with terror and dread, witnesses said. The sisters stayed in a section of the overcrowded camp with no lighting, little water and no latrine. They slept on lice-ridden straw and violent storms shredded the tents, according to the researchers. Like the other prisoners, the sisters endured long hours at roll call. Her classmate, Nannette Blitz, recalled seeing Anne there in December 1944: "She was no more than a skeleton by then. She was wrapped in a blanket; she couldn't bear to wear her clothes anymore because they were crawling with lice." Listen to Anne Frank's friends describe her concentration camp experience. As the Russians advanced further, the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp became even more crowded, bringing more disease. A deadly typhus outbreak caused thousands to die each day. Typhus is an infectious disease caused by lice that breaks out in places with poor hygiene. The disease causes high fever, chills and skin eruptions. "Because of the lice infesting the bedstraw and her clothes, Anne was exposed to the main carrier of epidemic typhus for an extended period," museum researchers wrote. They concluded that it's unlikely the sisters survived until March, because witnesses at the camp said the sisters both had symptoms before February 7. "Most deaths caused by typhus occur around twelve days after the first symptoms appear," wrote  authors Erika Prins and Gertjan Broek. The exact dates of death for Anne and Margot remain unclear. Margot died before Anne. "Anne never gave up hope," said Blitz, her friend. "She was absolutely convinced she would survive." Her diary endures as one of the world's most popular books. Read more about Anne Frank's cousin, a keeper of her legacy.

'The tests have been Liverpool and City,' he told Press Association Sport. 'This is another test. They have proven themselves, but this is the best team in the country and to go to Stamford Bridge is the toughest test. Louis van Gaal's side have performed admirably this season and are all but guaranteed Champions League. 'The performances from United in the past month have been absolutely outstanding in any season.

United dispatched of  Manchester City on Sunday as they extended their league lead over their rivals. 'We were always very fixed in our formation,' the England coach said of his time at Old Trafford.

Article: (CNN)A year ago Bloomberg published a story with the following headline: Mike Pence, a Koch Favorite, Mulls 2016 Run for President. The story ticked off items on Pence's conservative things-to-do list while also noting his close ties to the deep-pocketed Koch brothers, as well as other right-wing lobbying groups. Last August the Indiana governor was in Dallas for an Americans for Prosperity event; the group is backed by the conservative Koch brothers, and supported Gov. Pence's tax-slashing budget. Now, Pence is drawing huge heat for his controversial decision to sign a religious freedom law last week that opens the door to discrimination against gays and lesbians.  Why would Pence ignore the pleas of Indiana's Chamber of Commerce as well as the Republican mayor of his state capital and sign such a bill? Because there's a very powerful wing of his party that wants a conservative as its 2016 candidate and this bill was Pence's way of shoring up his street cred. It is also the reason why Republican Jeb Bush, Pence's fellow White House hopeful, who is viewed as a little light in that category, was first to rush in to defend Pence and the law. One lesson here: Just because more than 70% of the country now lives in states where same-sex marriage is legal does not mean 70% of the country is happy about it. Backlash aside, the fact is Pence has scored a lot of points this week among ultraconservatives. And while that may not be enough to get him over this political hump, the very public debate that now embroils him — and Arkansas Gov.  Asa Hutchinson, and likely 14 other states considering similar proposals this year -- is more than enough to drag the entire Republican field farther to the right than the party had hoped. Pence: 'Was I expecting this kind of backlash? Heavens no.' For there is no way a Republican can get through the pending primary without denouncing LGBT rights, which unfortunately will turn numerous Americans into single-issue voters. I foolishly hoped the issue of LGBT rights would be a bit player in the 2016 general election, overshadowed by foreign policy and the economy. Instead it looks like it's going to be dragged down to a replay of Pat Buchanan's "cultural war" speech, during which he told the 1992 Republican National Convention: "We stand with (George H.W. Bush) against the amoral idea that gay and lesbian couples should have the same standing in law as married men and women" and later followed with "There is a religious war going on in this country. It is a cultural war, as critical to the kind of nation we shall be as the Cold War itself. For this war is for the soul of America." Progressives may enjoy watching Pence's temporary fall from grace, but his policy rhetoric has echoed that of 2016 hopeful Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who has indicated a federal ban on same-sex marriage is not off the GOP table. And even if you think neither Pence nor Bush nor Cruz will win the nomination, someone has to. In light of that, listen to conservative former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, a potential 2016 candidate describing  conservatives' discomfort with same-sex marriage: "It's like asking someone who's Jewish to start serving bacon-wrapped shrimp in their deli." Or Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal: "I certainly will support Ted Cruz and others that are talking about making... a constitutional amendment to allow states to continue to define marriage." Or Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who has a long history of fighting against same-sex marriage and civil unions. And Ben Carson said jail turns people gay, so there's that. Remember: Pence didn't act alone. He only signed a bill that first passed muster with other elected officials. In fact, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, "the Indiana RFRA [Religious Freedom Restoration Act] is one of 24 introduced in 15 states this year that could allow someone to use their religious beliefs to discriminate. Numerous other bills specifically single out the LGBT community for unequal treatment." Who supports, denounces Indiana law? Gallup Polls may suggest voters nationwide are more gay-friendly, but the trend on the state level tells a different story. Perhaps we're witnessing the final gasp of long-ago biases. Or maybe those biases are having a rebirth we had underestimated. Former Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, the first member of Congress to marry someone of the same sex while in office, said he believes Republicans want the Supreme Court to rule in favor of same-sex marriage to provide political cover in the GOP primary. "We're winning," he told a crowd in Chicago recently while promoting his latest book. I guess if you look at where the country was on LGBT issues 10 years ago, we definitely are. That's assuming you are part of the "we" who believe LGBT people should have the same rights as their heterosexual/cisgender counterparts. But as the situation in Indiana has shown, "winning" should not be mistaken for having "won." For it is doubtful that a candidate will be able to avoid taking a position on the wave of so-called "religious freedom" bills snaking through red-state legislatures. Or to sidestep the topic of a constitutional amendment when it's raised in a debate or at a campaign stop, especially with Republicans controlling both the House and the Senate. Pence, and to a lesser extent, Jeb Bush, may be toxic now but America has a short attention span. More importantly, they are not alone. Frank said when progressives get angry they march in the streets, and when conservatives get mad they march to the polls. If that holds true in 2016, "winning" is going to feel very strange.

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence. Mike Pence's decision to sign a religious freedom law in Indiana has sparked controversy and backlash, but it may also be a way for him to shore up his conservative credentials and appeal to ultraconservatives in the Republican

Article: It's that time of the season when Premier League footballers cast their vote for the PFA Players’ Player of the Year. Last year’s winner Luis Suarez now resides in Spain, so, too, does 2013 victor Gareth Bale. It means we’re almost certain to see a new name on the trophy come May. Here, Sportsmail runs you through the six leading contenders…. Name: Harry Kane. Club: Tottenham. Age: 21. Stats: Apps 44, Goals 29. Striker Harry Kane has hit an astonishing 29 goals in 44 games for Tottenham so far this season. Kane (second right) has twice been named Player of the Month during his breakthrough campaign. Kane (left) broke into the England squad and scored 79 seconds into his debut against Lithuania. Reasons he deserves it: Very few would have predicted Kane would plunder an incredible 29 goals by early April in what is essentially his breakthrough season. His has been the name on everyone’s lips since the turn of the year and last month’s England call-up was thoroughly deserved. In an age where diving, spitting, lying and cheating too often dominate our news agenda, Kane’s goal-laden arrival has been a joy to witness. Reasons he doesn’t: Are there any? You could argue it took him until November to score two Premier League goals but that was as much to do with a lack of opportunities. Previous (individual) Premier League honours: Player of the Month (2) Name: Eden Hazard. Club: Chelsea. Age: 24. Stats: Apps 44, Goals 17. Eden Hazard has been Chelsea's outstanding performer, scoring 17 times in 44 games. Hazard (left) has been a menace to opponents all season with his trickery and high workrate. Hazard (centre) is the odds-on favourite to be named PFA Players' Player of the Year. Reasons he deserves it: He’s running back into form at just the right time and his goals look like they’ll edge Chelsea towards the title. Hazard, under the instruction of Jose Mourinho, has married graft to his craft and has been his side’s outstanding player this season. The fact he works so hard in addition to his creativity is sure to earn the respect of fellow pros and it’s no surprise he is the odds-on favourite for the prize. Reasons he doesn’t: Like Kane, it is hard to make an argument against a player who has performed at such a high level on a consistent basis. It did, however, take the Belgian a little while to find his scoring stride and he netted just once in the opening nine matches of the campaign. Previous honours: PFA Young Player of the Year 2014, PFA Team of the Year 2013 & 2014. Name: Diego Costa. Club: Chelsea. Age: 26. Stats: Apps 30, Goals 18. Reasons he deserves it: His immediate impact was sensational, smashing seven goals in his first four outings. His presence as the spearhead of Chelsea’s attack has turned them into title winners and he isn’t afraid to put in a shift either. Diego Costa has spearheaded Chelsea's attack this season, with 18 goals in 30 appearances. Costa (right) fires in the winner for Chelsea in their 2-1 victory over Liverpool at Anfield. Costa's bid to become Player of the Year could be hampered by the games he has missed through injury. Reasons he doesn’t: He’s missed too many games because of injury, as well as suspension, and is too often on our back pages for the wrong reasons. It is that edge which will probably dissuade fellow pros from voting for the Spaniard. Previous honours: Player of the Month (1) Name: Sergio Aguero. Club: Manchester City. Age: 26. Stats: Apps 31, Goals 23. Reasons he deserves it: Without his goals City’s title challenge would have faded long ago. It has been a poor season at the Etihad. Aguero, though, has managed to mask those shortcomings with his brilliance. His four goals against Spurs and match-winning treble versus Bayern Munich are among the best individual performances of the season. Meanwhile, he was so devastating during his two-goal show at Sunderland that the home crowd rose to applaud the Argentine when he made way late on. Sergio Aguero has again been in prolific scoring form for Manchester City, blasting 23 goals in  31 matches. Aguero (right) has struggled with fitness and has only managed to score three times in the league in 2015. Reasons he doesn’t: If Aguero managed to avoid what are all-too-frequent visits to the treatment room then City might be pushing Chelsea harder for the league title. He only has three league goals in 2015 and, while his numbers remain impressive, that lack of consistency will cost him votes. Previous honours: Player of the Month (2) Name: David de Gea. Club: Manchester United. Age: 24. Stats: Apps 37, Clean sheets 13. David de Gea (left) has been outstanding for Manchester United with 13 clean sheets this season. De Gea shone for United in the early part of the Premier League campaign when United struggled for form. De Gea's displays have been integral to United's top-four charge and he has been their best player. Reasons he deserves it: Only De Gea was spared criticism as United struggled to find their rhythm during the early part of the season. Indeed, there was an argument that, without his points-saving heroics, Louis van Gaal might have come under pressure far sooner. He has matured into the goalkeeper Sir Alex Ferguson thought he would and it is little wonder he is now being courted by the likes of Real Madrid. Reasons he doesn’t: Only the goalkeeper in a title-winning side would land the PFA prize, you feel. For while De Gea has been United’s best player, he has not single-handedly done enough to turn them into challengers for the Premier League crown. Previous honours: PFA Team of the Year 2013. Name: Alexis Sanchez. Club: Arsenal. Age: 26. Stats: Apps 43, Goals 20. Alexis Sanchez hit the ground running at Arsenal following his Barcelona switch, with 20 goals in 43 games. Sanchez hit 14 goals in 18 appearances during his most relentless scoring period this season. Chile international Sanchez has added greater aggression to Arsenal's attacking line with his arrival. Reasons he deserves it: There was a suspicion it would take the Chilean time to settle in the Premier League. Well, he didn’t score in his first four matches but then embarked on a run which yielded 14 in 18. His energy, aggression and will to win – coupled with bags of quality – has made all to the difference to an Arsenal side previously lacking in such vigour. Reasons he doesn’t: His goals have dried up since January and his awesome autumn could well be forgotten by the time votes are cast. However, he is still a certainty for Arsenal’s individual annual honours. Previous honours: Player of the Month (1) Name: Jordan Henderson. Club: Liverpool. Age: 24. Stats: Apps 45, Goals 7. Reasons he deserves it: He has emerged as Liverpool’s future captain having taken on responsibility in the centre of the park. Henderson barely misses a minute and is now a certain starter for his country – not bad for a player who Sir Alex Ferguson said could not run properly. He’s also added goals to his game and is a real pro’s pro – it would be no surprise to see him land his fair share of the votes. Jordan Henderson (centre) has continued his development into an essential player for Liverpool this season. Henderson emerged as Liverpool's future captain with Steven Gerrard (right) leaving at the end of the season. Henderson has added more goals to his game and has been ever present throughout Liverpool's campaign. Reasons he doesn’t: It hasn’t been a vintage year for Liverpool and their bid for Champions League football looks set to end in failure. As good as Henderson has been, this will almost certainly cost him the top prize. Previous honours: None. VERDICT: If the bookies are to be believed then the award will be going to last season’s Young Player of the Year, Eden Hazard. However, don’t underestimate the amount of goodwill there is towards Harry Kane within the game and he could well clean up with both the young and senior prizes. And that Roy of the Rovers tale would be a victory for everything we love about the game. Kane certainly gets my vote!

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence.
Premier League footballers are voting for PFA Players' Player of the Year. Eden Hazard and Harry Kane are the leading candidates for the award. Sergio Aguero, Alexis Sanchez and David de Gea are also contenders. Luis Suarez won last year with Gareth Bale taking the prize the year before.

Article: (CNN)If you're famous and performing the American national anthem, be prepared to become a national hero or a national disgrace. Facts are facts.  Just ask Vince, Whitney, Roseanne, Jimi and Michael. Mötley Crüe's Vince Neil reminded us again this week of the dangers of tackling "The Star-Spangled Banner." Sure, he can shred it on "Girls, Girls, Girls" and "Dr. Feelgood," but this is a different story -- a completely different story. To say Neil butchered the song before the Las Vegas Outlaws Arena Football League game would be unkind to those in the profession.  There's less carnage when butchers are done with their work. The late Whitney Houston set the modern standard for the national anthem at Super Bowl XXV.  In the early stages of the Gulf War in 1991, a patriotic America saluted her performance. Just six months earlier, comedian Roseanne Barr may have established the low-water mark. The crowd at the San Diego Padres game booed her rendition and President George H. W. Bush called it "disgraceful." There's nothing quite like getting the presidential thumbs down. One of the most controversial and beloved versions of "The Star-Spangled Banner" comes from 1969. Guitar slinger Jimi Hendrix inflamed mainstream America with his psychedelic take on the national anthem to the delight of the Woodstock generation. And then there's Michael Bolton's version.  Overly wrought songs are his specialty and he doesn't disappoint in that department when he sings at the American League Championship Series in 2003.  Bolton belts it out, but there's one little problem -- the words.  Can anyone say crib notes?

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence. Vince Neil of Mötley Crüe recently performed a poor rendition of the national anthem, reminding people of other controversial performances, including those by Whitney Houston, Roseanne Barr, Jimi Hendrix, and Michael

Article: In the search for meaning and importance, the FA Cup might have found its saviour. Enter Liverpool and Brendan Rodgers, a club and manager not just popping into the party to say a polite hello and a quick goodbye. Tonight, against Blackburn at Ewood Park, Rodgers faces one of those defining moments in a season that has not lacked them. His only hope must be that this time it doesn't go so horribly wrong. So far it has been a theme of the campaign that when the need was greatest, so too have been the disappointments. He loaded for duck on a bear hunt in the Champions League against Real Madrid and lost. He wanted to save his best resources for Chelsea and lost that game, too. Kolo Toure found the net in Liverpool's FA Cup clash with Blackburn but his effort was ruled out. Blackburn salute their fans at Anfield after earning a Sixth Round replay at home to the Premier League side. When the European portion of their season fizzled out, first in the big show and then in the Europa League, the Premier League offered an opportunity. Getting into the top-four without Luis Suarez and often in the absence of Daniel Sturridge would be an immense achievement. Having started the season so badly and recovered so impressively, it became a real possibility. Then two huge games - Manchester United and Arsenal. A chance. Steven Gerrard lost his mind, the defence lost the plot and Liverpool lost by a combined total of 6-2 across the two games. A top-four place is virtually gone, unless anyone can conceivably see them making up seven points and a massive goal difference on Manchester City. Suddenly, the romance of the FA Cup is a little more two-sided. They need it badly. Steven Gerrard's birthday falls on May 30, the same day as the FA Cup final at Wembley. The FA Cup represents Liverpool's last chance of silverware after a disappointing season. 'I don't want to go down the route of saying that it saves our season,' said Rodgers before the replay of their quarter-final against Blackburn. 'Our objective at the start, though, was to win a trophy. 'So I think if we didn't get in the top four and we didn't have a trophy this year, we would be disappointed. I think certainly the FA Cup would give us a great boost as a team with lots of young players and players coming into the club. 'That's the expectancy we want. We want to be able to be challenging every year. 'That was the key thing for me, to get the group challenging at the top end of the league and for trophies. The FA Cup would mark a good step forward for us.' The need for trophies has been a dominant theme since Rodgers took over at Liverpool and made them contenders again. There is no denying the steps he has taken with the club and very little to suggest he is anything other than one of the sharpest managerial minds working in this country. Daniel Sturridge will be crucial to Liverpool's chances of reaching the FA Cup semi-final. Glen Johnson is in good spirits in training ahead of Liverpool's trip to Ewood Park on Wednesday. But how he will be tested if this season ends without either a top-four place or a trophy. Raheem Sterling rather helpfully alluded to the need for the latter recently. That tricky contract situation has not gone away and it is less likely to have a happy ending for Liverpool if they can't present a silver argument to Sterling in the summer. The same goes for potential new arrivals. Rodgers can talk magnificently and persuasively but his sales pitches to leading players would be enhanced immeasurably if he could talk about current achievements. Something shiny and tangible and recently acquired would help. It's a tough ask. They face Blackburn with a defence looking as woefully shaky as it did at the start of the season. Without Martin Skrtel and Emre Can tonight that defence could be vulnerable again. Steven Gerrard is also missing. Not ideal, though not necessarily a tremendous setback against a Championship side. In any case, Liverpool and Rodgers need to find a way through. It has been three years since they last won a trophy – under Kenny Dalglish - and the FA Cup is a chance to stop the clock. It's a defining moment that must not end in another failure. Liverpool have not won a trophy since they beat Cardiff to win the Carling Cup three years ago. Real Madrid 1-0 Liverpool, November 4. Finally back on the grandest stage, but Rodgers opted for a watered down XI. Dejan Lovren, Steven Gerrard, Raheem Stirling, Jordan Henderson, Philippe Coutinho and Mario Balotelli played all previous Champions League matches but none of them started. The aim, it appeared, was to prioritise the following league game. Karim Benzema celebrates scoring for Real Madrid against Liverpool at the Bernabeu. Liverpool 1-2 Chelsea, November 8. It was time to vindicate the gamble in Madrid, which was widely criticised. Rodgers made seven changes to the side that lost in the Champions League and Emre Can put them ahead. But Chelsea won 2-1, leaving Liverpool eighth in the Premier League. Having rested a host of players in Madrid, Brendan Rodgers' side then lost a crunch league game to Chelsea. Chelsea 1-0 Liverpool, January 27. After drawing the first leg of their Capital One Cup semi-final, Liverpool blew a host of chances and fell to a stoppage-time winner. A big opportunity missed. The Stamford Bridge also knocked Liverpool out of the Capital One Cup following a 1-0 win at home. Besiktas 1-0 Liverpool, February 26. Ten years after their Champions League miracle in Istanbul, Liverpool returned to face Besiktas in the Europa League last 32. They held a 1-0 first-leg lead. It went horribly wrong and they lost on penalties. 'Unfortunately, on this occasion, Istanbul is not a happy place,' said Rodgers. Demba Ba celebrates after Dejan Lovren missed the crucial penalty in the shoot-out against Besiktas. Arsenal 4-1 Liverpool, April 4. Liverpool's last real shot at getting into the top four and it fell apart spectacularly. Raheem Sterling's unauthorised interview hardly helped matters in the build-up and the game was a disaster. They were 3-0 down at half-time and ultimately repeated the kind of defensive inadequacies that hurt them earlier in the campaign. A huge anti-climax. Mesut Ozil curls home Arsenal's second in their 4-1 win over Liverpool in the Premier League last weekend.

Liverpool take on Blackburn in their FA Cup Sixth Round replay tonight. The competition represents the Anfield club's last chance of success. Brendan Rodgers' side are all but out of the race for the top four. Liverpool also endured poor campaigns in both European campaigns. Robbie Fowler: FA Cup hunt must not be all about Steven Gerrard.

Article: (CNN)As goes Walmart, so goes the nation? Everyone from Apple CEO Tim Cook to the head of the NCAA slammed religious freedom laws being considered in several states this week, warning that they would open the door to discrimination against gay and lesbian customers. But it was the opposition from Walmart, the ubiquitous retailer that dots the American landscape, that perhaps resonated most deeply, providing the latest evidence of growing support for gay rights in the heartland. Walmart's staunch criticism of a religious freedom law in its home state of Arkansas came after the company said in February it would boost pay for about 500,000 workers well above the federal minimum wage. Taken together, the company is emerging as a bellwether for shifting public opinion on hot-button political issues that divide conservatives and liberals. And some prominent Republicans are urging the party to take notice. Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, who famously called on the GOP to "be the party of Sam's Club, not just the country club," told CNN that Walmart's actions "foreshadow where the Republican Party will need to move." "The Republican Party will have to better stand for" ideas on helping the middle class, said Pawlenty, the head of the Financial Services Roundtable, a Washington lobbying group for the finance industry. The party's leaders must be "willing to put forward ideas that will help modest income workers, such as a reasonable increase in the minimum wage, and prohibit discrimination in things such as jobs, housing, public accommodation against gays and lesbians." Walmart, which employs more than 50,000 people in Arkansas, emerged victorious on Wednesday. Hours after the company's CEO, Doug McMillon, called on Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson to veto the bill, the governor held a news conference and announced he would not sign the legislation unless its language was fixed. Walmart's opposition to the religious freedom law once again puts the company at odds with many in the Republican Party, which the company's political action committee has tended to support. In 2004, the Walmart PAC gave around $2 million to Republicans versus less than $500,000 to Democrats, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. That gap has grown less pronounced in recent years. In 2014, the PAC spent about $1.3 million to support Republicans and around $970,000 for Democrats. It has been a gradual transformation for Walmart. In 2011, the company bulked up its nondiscrimination policies by adding protections for gender identity. Two years later, the company announced that it would start offering health insurance benefits to same-sex partners of employees starting in 2014. Retail experts say Walmart's evolution on these issues over the years is partly a reflection of its diverse consumer base, as well as a recognition of the country's increasingly progressive views of gay equality (support for same-sex marriage is at a new high of 59%, according to a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll). "It's easy for someone like a Chick-fil-A to take a really polarizing position," said Dwight Hill, a partner at the retail consulting firm McMillanDoolittle. "But in the world of the largest retailer in the world, that's very different." Hill added: Same-sex marriage, "while divisive, it's becoming more common place here within the U.S., and the businesses by definition have to follow the trend of their customer." The backlash over the religious freedom measures in Indiana and Arkansas this week is shining a bright light on the broader business community's overwhelming support for workplace policies that promote gay equality. After Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, a Republican, signed his state's religious freedom bill into law, CEOs of companies big and small across the country threatened to pull out of the Hoosier state. The resistance came from business leaders of all political persuasions, including Bill Oesterle, CEO of the business-rating website Angie's List and a one-time campaign manager for former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels. Oesterle announced that his company would put plans on hold to expand its footprint in Indianapolis in light of the state's passage of the religious freedom act. NASCAR, scheduled to hold a race in Indianapolis this summer, also spoke out against the Indiana law. "What we're seeing over the past week is a tremendous amount of support from the business community who are standing up and are sending that equality is good for business and discrimination is bad for business," said Jason Rahlan, spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign. The debate has reached presidential politics. National Republicans are being forced to walk the fine line of protecting religious liberties and supporting nondiscrimination. Likely GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush initially backed Indiana's religious freedom law and Pence, but moderated his tone a few days later. The former Florida governor said Wednesday that Indiana could have taken a "better" and "more consensus-oriented approach." "By the end of the week, Indiana will be in the right place," Bush said, a reference to Pence's promise this week to fix his state's law in light of the widespread backlash. Others in the GOP field are digging in. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, the only officially declared Republican presidential candidate, said Wednesday that he had no interest in second-guessing Pence and lashed out at the business community for opposing the law. "I think it is unfortunate that large companies today are listening to the extreme left wing agenda that is driven by an aggressive gay marriage agenda," Cruz said. Meanwhile, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who previously served on Walmart's board of directors, called on Hutchinson to veto the Arkansas bill, saying it would "permit unfair discrimination" against the LGBT community. Jay Chesshir, CEO of the Little Rock Regional Chamber of Commerce in Arkansas, welcomed Hutchinson's pledge on Wednesday to seek changes to his state's bill. He said businesses are not afraid to wade into a politically controversial debate to ensure inclusive workplace policies. "When it comes to culture and quality of life, businesses are extremely interested in engaging in debate simply because it impacts its more precious resource -- and that's its people," Chesshir said. "Therefore, when issues arise that have negative or positive impact on those things, then the business community will again speak and speak loudly."

Cleanup of the area was underway on Tuesday. Scroll down for video. Crushed: Bricks fell from the top of a building in Cleveland on Monday afternoon crushing a car below. Freak accident: Cleveland fire spokesman Larry Gray told local media the falling bricks might have been a 'freak accident' and said that the building was not under construction. Officials said the area would remain closed as crews cleaned up and investigators determined if other bricks from the building could fall. The building and minivan were unoccupied at the time of the collapse, and no injuries were reported.

Article: (CNN)On May 28, 2014, some 7,000 people gathered in a stadium in China's northwestern Xinjiang region. But they had not come to watch the local football team or any other grand sporting event. Instead, the authorities paraded scores of prisoners dressed in orange jumpsuits. Armed soldiers guarded the exits. In the patently unfair, open air trial that followed, 55 people were found guilty of a range of offenses linked to violent attacks in the region and jailed. Three were sentenced to death. The public mass sentencing was part a China's "Strike Hard" campaign against unrest in Xinjiang, a campaign the government claims was launched to combat "terrorism" and "separatism." But it was also indicative of a trend that was starkly evident last year around the world -- governments using the death penalty in a misguided, and often cynical, attempt to tackle crime and terrorism. Today, Amnesty International releases its annual review of the death penalty worldwide.  Much of it makes for grim reading. In Pakistan, the government lifted a six-year moratorium on the execution of civilians in the wake of the horrific Taliban attack on a school in Peshawar in December. More than 60 people have been put to death since, and the government has threatened to send thousands more death row prisoners to the gallows.  Iran and Iraq executed people for "terrorism," and other countries expanded the scope of capital crimes in their penal codes. In a year when abhorrent summary executions by armed groups were branded on the global consciousness as never before, governments are themselves resorting to more executions in a knee-jerk reaction to terrorism. Other countries made use of executions in similarly flawed attempts to address -- or appear to address -- crime rates. Jordan ended an eight-year moratorium in December, putting 11 murder convicts to death, with the government saying it was a move to end a surge in violent crime.  In Indonesia, authorities announced plans to execute mainly drug traffickers to tackle a public safety "national emergency." Six people have already been executed this year. A sharp spike in death sentences recorded in 2014 -- up more than 500 on the previous year -- can also be attributed to governments using the death penalty as a political tool.  The rise was largely because of developments in Egypt and Nigeria, where courts imposed hundreds of death sentences in the context of internal political instability or crime and armed conflict. The simple fact is that governments using the death penalty to tackle crime and security threats are deceiving themselves or the public or both. There is no evidence that the threat of execution is more of a deterrent to crime than a prison sentence, as United Nations and other studies have repeatedly confirmed. It is high time that world leaders stop using the death penalty as an easy way out when times get tough. At Amnesty International, we have campaigned for an end to the death penalty for decades. Thankfully, most of the world now appears to agree with us. The numbers speak for themselves. In 1945 when the United Nations was founded, only eight countries had abolished the death penalty. Today, 140 states are abolitionist in law or practice. Last year, we recorded executions in 22 countries, down by almost a half from 20 years ago. Despite the troubling developments we recorded last year, there was still much good news to be found. The number of executions recorded around the world dropped significantly in 2014 compared with the previous year, from 778 to 607. This number does not include China, where more people are put to death than the rest of the world put together, but with death penalty statistics treated as a state secret, the true figure is impossible to determine. Executions were recorded in only three countries in sub-Saharan Africa -- Equatorial Guinea, Somalia and Sudan -- and the number of people put to death went down by more than a quarter. The Americas continued to be execution-free, apart from the United States. Those governments that still execute need to realize that they are on the wrong side of history. They must join the vast majority of countries which have dropped the ultimate cruel punishment. Fighting for an end to the death penalty remains an uphill task, but all of us must try to make the world free of this punishment. With determination, I know that we can achieve this goal.

Amnesty International released its annual review of the death penalty worldwide, which shows that governments are using the death penalty more frequently in a misguided attempt to combat crime and terrorism, despite evidence that it is not an effective deterrent and most of the world has

Article: Marseille, France (CNN)The French prosecutor leading an investigation into the crash of Germanwings Flight 9525 insisted Wednesday that he was not aware of any video footage from on board the plane. Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin told CNN that "so far no videos were used in the crash investigation." He added, "A person who has such a video needs to immediately give it to the investigators." Robin's comments follow claims by two magazines, German daily Bild and French Paris Match, of a cell phone video showing the harrowing final seconds from on board Germanwings Flight 9525 as it crashed into the French Alps. All 150 on board were killed. Paris Match and Bild reported that the video was recovered from a phone at the wreckage site. The two publications described the supposed video, but did not post it on their websites. The publications said that they watched the video, which was found by a source close to the investigation. "One can hear cries of 'My God' in several languages," Paris Match reported. "Metallic banging can also be heard more than three times, perhaps of the pilot trying to open the cockpit door with a heavy object.  Towards the end, after a heavy shake, stronger than the others, the screaming intensifies. Then nothing." "It is a very disturbing scene," said Julian Reichelt, editor-in-chief of Bild online. An official with France's accident investigation agency, the BEA, said the agency is not aware of any such video. Lt. Col. Jean-Marc Menichini, a French Gendarmerie spokesman in charge of communications on rescue efforts around the Germanwings crash site, told CNN that the reports were "completely wrong" and "unwarranted." Cell phones have been collected at the site, he said, but that they "hadn't been exploited yet." Menichini said he believed the cell phones would need to be sent to the Criminal Research Institute in Rosny sous-Bois, near Paris, in order to be analyzed by specialized technicians working hand-in-hand with investigators. But none of the cell phones found so far have been sent to the institute, Menichini said. Asked whether staff involved in the search could have leaked a memory card to the media, Menichini answered with a categorical "no." Reichelt told "Erin Burnett: Outfront" that he had watched the video and stood by the report, saying Bild and Paris Match are "very confident" that the clip is real. He noted that investigators only revealed they'd recovered cell phones from the crash site after Bild and Paris Match published their reports. "That is something we did not know before.... Overall we can say many things of the investigation weren't revealed by the investigation at the beginning," he said. What was mental state of Germanwings co-pilot? German airline Lufthansa confirmed Tuesday that co-pilot Andreas Lubitz had battled depression years before he took the controls of Germanwings Flight 9525, which he's accused of deliberately crashing last week in the French Alps. Lubitz told his Lufthansa flight training school in 2009 that he had a "previous episode of severe depression," the airline said Tuesday. Email correspondence between Lubitz and the school discovered in an internal investigation, Lufthansa said, included medical documents he submitted in connection with resuming his flight training. The announcement indicates that Lufthansa, the parent company of Germanwings, knew of Lubitz's battle with depression, allowed him to continue training and ultimately put him in the cockpit. Lufthansa, whose CEO Carsten Spohr previously said Lubitz was 100% fit to fly, described its statement Tuesday as a "swift and seamless clarification" and said it was sharing the information and documents -- including training and medical records -- with public prosecutors. Spohr traveled to the crash site Wednesday, where recovery teams have been working for the past week to recover human remains and plane debris scattered across a steep mountainside. He saw the crisis center set up in Seyne-les-Alpes, laid a wreath in the village of Le Vernet, closer to the crash site, where grieving families have left flowers at a simple stone memorial. Menichini told CNN late Tuesday that no visible human remains were left at the site but recovery teams would keep searching. French President Francois Hollande, speaking Tuesday, said that it should be possible to identify all the victims using DNA analysis by the end of the week, sooner than authorities had previously suggested. In the meantime, the recovery of the victims' personal belongings will start Wednesday, Menichini said. Among those personal belongings could be more cell phones belonging to the 144 passengers and six crew on board. Check out the latest from our correspondents. The details about Lubitz's correspondence with the flight school during his training were among several developments as investigators continued to delve into what caused the crash and Lubitz's possible motive for downing the jet. A Lufthansa spokesperson told CNN on Tuesday that Lubitz had a valid medical certificate, had passed all his examinations and "held all the licenses required." Earlier, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office in Dusseldorf, Christoph Kumpa, said medical records reveal Lubitz suffered from suicidal tendencies at some point before his aviation career and underwent psychotherapy before he got his pilot's license. Kumpa emphasized there's no evidence suggesting Lubitz was suicidal or acting aggressively before the crash. Investigators are looking into whether Lubitz feared his medical condition would cause him to lose his pilot's license, a European government official briefed on the investigation told CNN on Tuesday. While flying was "a big part of his life," the source said, it's only one theory being considered. Another source, a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation, also told CNN that authorities believe the primary motive for Lubitz to bring down the plane was that he feared he would not be allowed to fly because of his medical problems. Lubitz's girlfriend told investigators he had seen an eye doctor and a neuropsychologist, both of whom deemed him unfit to work recently and concluded he had psychological issues, the European government official said. But no matter what details emerge about his previous mental health struggles, there's more to the story, said Brian Russell, a forensic psychologist. "Psychology can explain why somebody would turn rage inward on themselves about the fact that maybe they weren't going to keep doing their job and they're upset about that and so they're suicidal," he said. "But there is no mental illness that explains why somebody then feels entitled to also take that rage and turn it outward on 149 other people who had nothing to do with the person's problems."

Article: (CNN)The Rev. Robert H. Schuller, California televangelist and founder of the television ministry "Hour of Power," died Thursday, according to his family. He was 88 years old. Schuller, also the founder of Crystal Cathedral megachurch, had been diagnosed with esophageal cancer in August 2013, a release from "Hour of Power" said. "My father-in-law passed away peacefully early this morning. He was a great Dad and a great man of God," said Schuller's daughter-in-law, Donna Schuller, in a Twitter message. Schuller's life followed an almost Shakespearean arc. He was born in a Iowa farmhouse without running water and longed to preach from his earliest days. In his autobiography, "Prayer: My Soul's Adventure with God," he described standing alone by a river and picturing himself delivering sermons to a rapt congregation. After attending a Hope College and Western Theological Seminary in Michigan, he met his wife of more than 60 years, Arvella, while preaching at her church (she was the organist). With their young family in tow, the Schullers caravanned west to California, where he rented a drive-in theater and preached from the roof of the snack bar. It was beneath the dignity of Christian ministry, some local pastors huffed. The "passion pits" where teenagers necked was no place for the gospel. Schuller was undeterred, and he quickly outgrew the drive-in. He called the explosive growth of his tiny congregation a "miracle," though his many mainstream critics had other names for it. His confident, breezy version of Christianity -- too breezy, by some estimations -- drew hordes of seekers and lapsed Christians who were put off by the hellfire fulminations of many post-War American preachers. Schuller sold a softer, gentler message, which borrowed heavily, he acknowledged, from the father of the feel-good gospel, Norman Vincent Peale. He preached not to convert or condemn people, but to encourage them, a sentiment he called "possibility thinking." People loved it. "Evangelicalism at its best wants to be innovative and reach people," said Timothy Larsen, a professor of Christian thought at Wheaton College in Illinois. "And Schuller was a master at that." "What he got right is that the gospel is good news," Larsen continued. "And he preached an uplifting message about personal transformation and uplift and hope." Some of Schuller's favored phrases, though, struck others as cornpone Christianity. "Turn your hurt into a halo?" said Randall Balmer, a professor of American religious history at Dartmouth College, citing one such phrase. "That's pretty weak tea." Still, Balmer gives Schuller some credit. "It may be bad theology, but it's brilliant marketing." In 1970, Schuller began broadcasting "Hour of Power," believed to be one of the first, if not the very first, Sunday service to be shown regularly on television. With his genial smile, priestly robes and gray hair, he looked and talked like a guy who wanted nothing more than to see his flock succeed. The show, which ran for decades, reached millions, making Schuller a televangelist before the term became tarnished by the sins of his many successors. Schuller's crowning achievement, at least architecturally, still stands in Orange County, California, though it is now owned by the Roman Catholic Church. The Crystal Cathedral, a great gleaming edifice with 10,000 glass panels, gave worshipers a look at the  clouds that house the heavens, while Schuller preached in the pulpit below. The message was clear to many: The road to the former ran through the latter. During the 1980s and 1990s, Schuller's star continued to rise, with presidents stopping by the Crystal Cathedral -- often during campaigns, it should be said -- and future megachurch pastors like Rick Warren and Bill Hybels seeking his advice. As Schuller aged, though, his family was beset by a succession scandal straight from the pages of "King Lear."  He tried to install his only son, Bobby Jr., as pastor of Crystal Cathedral. But the preaching styles of father and son were too different for the congregation -- measured at times at 10,000 strong -- to countenance. Bobby Schuller Jr. left "Hour of Power" and the pulpit at Crystal Cathedral after a short time. As the family searched for a new successor and tussled over finances, viewers and donations to the church and its television show dropped precipitously. Crystal Cathedral Ministries filed for bankruptcy in 2010, citing debts of more than $43 million, according to The Associated Press. Schuller's empire, which once soared as high as his glassy cathedral, had fallen to dust. Eventually, Schuller's grandson, also named Bobby, took over "Hour of Power," though at a different church. In a statement on Thursday, the younger Schuller recalled standing atop Crystal Cathedral's 12-story Tower of Hope with his grandfather as they surveyed the surrounding landscape. "You could see the whole world from there," he said. People we've lost in 2015. CNN's Stella Chan reported from Los Angeles.

Article: John Carver says his Newcastle players have a point to prove to themselves at Liverpool on Monday night. The Magpies are in danger of being sucked into what had previously seemed an unlikely relegation battle given their alarming run of form. Amid accusations of the team 'playing with their flip-flops on', United have lost four on the spin - scoring just once - and Carver admits he does not know where their next point is coming from. It is unlikely to arrive at Anfield, a venue at which they last won in 1994. They were beaten 1-0 by North-East rivals Sunderland seven days ago – a performance Carver labelled 'embarrassing' – and there was a showdown meeting at the club's training ground this week in which the head coach let his feelings be known. John Carver says his Newcastle players have a point to prove when they face Liverpool on Monday. Carver, though, is hoping that personal pride will kick in when they travel to Merseyside. 'Before they go out my message will be simple – 'You have a point to prove, but prove it for yourself, not for me, not for anybody else, but for yourself. You owe it for yourself',' he said. 'The meeting we had on Wednesday was non-negotiable. We've had meetings in the past where I like a two-way dialogue. 'But I got a few things off my chest and it was probably the first time I've been Mr Nasty. 'After the meeting we trained and there was a great response. That hurt me a little bit because I wanted to see that on Sunday. But at least I got something from them.' Carver said this week that owner Mike Ashley has promised to invest in the squad this summer and a major overhaul is expected – out-of-contract players such as Jonas Gutierrez, Ryan Taylor and Sammy Ameobi will be released, while the likes of Yoan Gouffran, Cheick Tiote, Moussa Sissoko and Papiss Cisse are also expected to move on. Newcastle in training earlier this week for their game against Liverpool on Monday in the Premier League. Moussa Sissoko (left), Vurnon Anita (centre) and Massadio Haidara (right) at a training session. However, the promise of such renovation has done little to appease fans who are organising a boycott ahead of next Sunday's visit of Spurs. Carver, in fairness, is caught in the middle of what is a toxic relationship between supporters and the club's hierarchy. And the 50-year-old admits he has been on the receiving end of criticism from fans. 'I have to accept what people say. As long as it is done the right way and in a constructive manner, I can accept that,' he said. Newcastle were beaten in last weekend's Tyne/Wear derby by Jermain Defoe's stunning volley. Carver has now seen his Newcastle team lose four in a row and fall into relegation danger. 'It would be easy to say, 'I've had enough, thanks'. I'm not going to do that and I have still got my enthusiasm. 'I can't hide from what happened on Sunday, and I won't hide from it. What I won't take is abuse, and certainly none of my family will take abuse. 'But I wanted to give this a go because I didn't want to have any regrets. I believe in my own ability and I believe if I have got the tools then I could do a good job and a successful job.'

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence.
Newcastle take on Liverpool on Monday night at Anfield. The Magpies have not won away at Liverpool since 1994. Newcastle have lost their last four games scoring just one goal. John Carver's side nine points clear of relegation zone in 13th place.

Article: (CNN)Michele Bachmann is comparing President Obama to the co-pilot of the doomed Germanwings flight. "With his Iran deal, Barack Obama is for the 300 million souls of the United States what Andreas Lubitz was for the 150 souls on the German Wings flight - a deranged pilot flying his entire nation into the rocks," the Minnesota Republican and former representative wrote in a Facebook comment posted March 31. "After the fact, among the smoldering remains of American cities, the shocked survivors will ask, why did he do it?" Andreas Lubitz, the co-pilot of Germanwings Flight 9525, is accused by authorities of deliberately crashing the plane in the French Alps. He died in the crash along with 149 other crew and passengers. The motive of the March 24 crash is under investigation, though investigators are looking in to whether Lubitz feared a medical condition would cause him to lose his pilot's license. Many comments posted on her Facebook page blasted the former representative. Melissa Coca wrote, "Comparing this tragedy to anything is moronic and despicable." Michael J Pristash wrote, "Your allusion is so inappropriate and divisive, not to mention disrespectful on so many levels. Shame on you." Some also accused her of taking desperate measures to stay in the public eye. Lynda Anderson wrote, "Posting outrageous things in a pathetic attempt to stay relevant?" Negotiations are coming down to the wire between Iran, the United States and other nations on restricting Tehran's nuclear program to prevent the ability to develop an atomic bomb. One deadline passed Tuesday, but there is a June 30 deadline for a comprehensive deal -- with all technical and diplomatic impasses fully worked out. Bachmann is no stranger to voicing her opinion on the President's dealing with Iran, personally telling him to "bomb Iran" during the 2014 White House Christmas Party. "I turned to the president and I said, something to the effect of, 'Mr. President, you need to bomb the Iranian nuclear facilities, because if you don't, Iran will have a nuclear weapon on your watch and the course of world history will change,'" she told the Washington Free Beacon. The congresswoman, who sought the GOP presidential nomination in 2012, said Obama had a "condescending smile on his face and laughed at me." She said he told her: "Well Michele, it's just not that easy."

Article: Alec Stewart is intrigued to hear more about the newly-created role of England cricket director. The Surrey director of cricket insisted his focus is on his role at The Oval and he is yet to speak to anyone at the England and Wales Cricket Board about the position, which is to be introduced following the departure of Paul Downton as managing director. Stewart's fellow former England captains Andrew Strauss and Michael Vaughan have also been linked to the job. Alec Stewart admitted he has had no contact with the ECB over the  role of England cricket director. The England head coach, Peter Moores, would report to the cricket director, but Stewart is among the potential candidates awaiting full clarity of the responsibilities of the position. Vaughan and Strauss, too, have expressed a wish to learn the details of the job specification, which could come when incoming chairman Colin Graves starts work next month alongside new chief executive Tom Harrison. 'Until anyone sees the job spec - whether it's Vaughan, myself, Straussy, whoever it may be - you can't comment,' Stewart told Press Association. Stewart, who played 133 Tests and 170 ODIs for England, is in the frame to replace the axed Paul Downton. 'All I've said is I've done everything that's ever been asked of me as an England player and if England thought that I would be the right type of person for that role, whatever that role may be, then you'd be stupid not to look at it. 'I'm under contract here. (The) ECB would have to seek permission to speak to me via Surrey. 'This is a great job that I'm thoroughly enjoying here. I seriously think we're going to be going places over the next few years. That's what I'm concentrating on. Michael Vaughan is also among the leading candidates to take up the newly-created role with England. 'I can't underestimate what a great job this is. But you always want to be aware of other things that are going on.' Asked if he had had any informal or preliminary discussions with the ECB hierarchy, Stewart added: 'None whatsoever. My focus is very much here and if somebody from the ECB rings me I'll take their phone call or meet them, but that hasn't happened.'

Article: Norfolk, Virginia (CNN)The second mate of the Houston Express probably couldn't believe what he was seeing. Hundreds of miles from land there was a small boat nearby. At first it looked abandoned. It was in bad shape, listing to one side. The crew of the 1,000-foot long container ship thought it was a yacht that had wrecked. Incredibly, as they got closer, they saw there was a man on it, signaling for help. "He was moving, walking around, waving to us and in surprisingly good condition," Capt. Thomas Grenz told CNN by phone Friday. That man, Louis Jordan, 37, had an amazing story. He'd been drifting on the 35-foot Pearson sailboat for more than two months since leaving Conway, South Carolina, to fish in the ocean. Just a few days into his trip, a storm capsized his boat and broke his mast. One of his shoulders was broken, too, so he couldn't fix the boat right away. Eventually he was able to rig a makeshift mast and sail, but he could make little headway against the currents. "It took so long," Jordan said.  "It moved so slowly." The boat capsized two more times before he was rescued, according to Jordan. His father, Frank Jordan, told CNN's Jim Sciutto that he was expecting his son to look different. "He looked good. Hadn't lost too much weight. He wasn't badly sunburned like I thought he probably would be," he said. Lost at sea for 66 days. After his food and water ran out, it became an issue of survival. Collecting fresh water was a nightmare for Jordan.  The weather wouldn't cooperate. Records show there were more than a dozen storms off the coast of the Carolinas during the time he was missing. The precipitation came at night during harsh conditions. "I had tried to collect (rain)water... but every time the waves would splash into the boat," Jordan said.  "The waves would put saltwater into my freshwater and it tasted bad. "Finally the conditions were right.  I filled up my water tank, which is 25 gallons.  I filled up a bucket." Then there was the issue of food. The fish weren't cooperating, but after a while Jordan learned they were attracted to his laundry, which he would put out to sea for a rinse. The fish would swim in and out of his clothes and he could easily scoop them up with a hand net, he said. Jordan came ashore Thursday evening. CNN affiliate WAVY in Norfolk, Virginia, reported that he was able to walk from the helicopter into Sentara Norfolk General Hospital about 7:30 p.m. Coast Guard officials have said they have found no reason to doubt Jordan's incredible story. They noted that his father contacted them January 29 to report his son and his boat missing. Frank Jordan addressed the skepticism about his son's appearance, saying the boat stayed afloat and upright most of the time. His son spent most of his days in the cabin, out of the sun. Frank Jordan said it was obvious when the Jordans met at the hospital Friday morning that his normally low-key and private son had been through an ordeal. "I know he went through what he went through," Frank Jordan said. Jordan is an unemployed truck driver who lived on his boat at a marina in Conway. He had free rent and free food in the river, he said. But when it became difficult to catch dinner, he took off for the ocean in hopes he would land some bigger fish. Frank Jordan told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Thursday that he had worried about his son, who is an inexperienced sailor, but he held hope because his son had a good boat. And he had the strength to make it. "He's got a very strong constitution and (is strong) not only physically, but spiritually," Frank Jordan said. "And he told me on the phone that he was praying the whole time, so I believe that sustained him a great deal." Rescue swimmer Kyle McCollum was the first to care for Jordan on the flight back to land. "You would expect sunburns, severe sunburn, blisters maybe... a bunch of medical issues that could possibly be wrong with him," he said. "But for him to be in his current state was pretty amazing." Grenz was also surprised by Jordan's condition, physically and mentally. The rescued sailor knew almost exactly what day it was, remarkable for someone who had been on the water for more than 60 days. Jordan was dehydrated and said he was hungry. "We took him to a rescue boat," the container ship captain said. "He was given water and pea soup to gain some power again." Derriel Morris, a neighbor at the Bucksport Plantation Marina & RV Resort called Jordan a nice guy who loved his 47-year-old boat, named "Angel." Morris said: "It was immaculate, it was gorgeous, beautifully painted. I mean it looked like a brand new sailboat." Morris told CNN affiliate WPDE that one day in January he was going to the store and Jordan asked him to bring back some coffee creamer. But when he returned to the marina, Jordan had slipped away. "There was no shore line, no hose; it was like he was never there," Morris told the station. After he disappeared others who also live there held a candlelight ceremony. The marina's manager, Jeff Weeks, told WPDE that Jordan is expected to be back at Buscksport next week. Tales of people who cheated death after days, weeks adrift.

Article: Harry Kane's participation with England at this summer's Under 21 European Championship remains in  doubt after Tottenham confirmed they will travel to Malaysia for a post-season friendly. Spurs announced on Tuesday morning they will visit Kuala Lumpur next month to take on a Malaysia XI in the AIA Cup. The match will take place at the Shah Alam Stadium on Wednesday, May 27 - before Tottenham  take on Sydney FC the following Saturday - and Kane has been told he will be part of the travelling party for the two exhibition games. Harry Kane could miss the Under 21 European Championship due to Tottenham playing a friendly in Malaysia. Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino has expressed fears about burnout for the 21-year-old striker with the FA in talks with Tottenham officials about Kane playing for the Under 21 side in the Czech Republic at this summer's tournament. Kane is keen to play in Gareth Southgate's side at the championship, which runs from June 17-30, but Pochettino wants the forward to miss the tournament in order to have enough recovery time ahead of next season. The young Tottenham forward, who captained his side during Sunday's 0-0 draw with Burnley, has been told he will not be required for the senior friendly against the Republic of Ireland on June 7 or the Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia a week later. Kane scored just 79 seconds into his England debut after coming off the bench to head home during last month's 4-0 win over Lithuania at Wembley. At just 21 years and 251 days, the Tottenham striker led out his side for the first time in draw with Burnley. Kane could not find a way to break the deadlock for Tottenham in the stalemate at Turf Moor on Sunday. Kane scored just 79 seconds into his England debut during the 4-0 win over Lithuania at Wembley last month.

Article: (CNN)The United States and its negotiating partners reached a very strong framework agreement with Iran in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Thursday that limits Iran's nuclear program in such a way as to effectively block it from building a nuclear weapon. Expect pushback anyway, if the recent past is any harbinger. Just last month, in an attempt to head off such an agreement, House Speaker John Boehner invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to preemptively blast it before Congress, and 47 senators sent a letter to the Iranian leadership warning them away from a deal. The debate that has already begun since the announcement of the new framework will likely result in more heat than light. It will not be helped by the gathering swirl of dubious assumptions and doubtful assertions. Let us address some of these:. The most misleading assertion, despite universal rejection by experts, is that the negotiations' objective at the outset was the total elimination of any nuclear program in Iran. That is the position of Netanyahu and his acolytes in the U.S. Congress. But that is not and never was the objective. If it had been, there would have been no Iranian team at the negotiating table. Rather, the objective has always been to structure an agreement or series of agreements so that Iran could not covertly develop a nuclear arsenal before the United States and its allies could respond. The new framework has exceeded expectations in achieving that goal. It would reduce Iran's low-enriched uranium stockpile, cut by two-thirds its number of installed centrifuges and implement a rigorous inspection regime. Another dubious assumption of opponents is that the Iranian nuclear program is a covert weapons program. Despite sharp accusations by some in the United States and its allies, Iran denies having such a program, and U.S. intelligence contends that Iran has not yet made the decision to build a nuclear weapon. Iran's continued cooperation with International Atomic Energy Agency inspections is further evidence on this point, and we'll know even more about Iran's program in the coming months and years because of the deal. In fact, the inspections provisions that are part of this agreement are designed to protect against any covert action by the Iranians. What's more, the rhetoric of some members of Congress has implied that the negotiations have been between only the United States and Iran (i.e., the 47 senators' letter warning that a deal might be killed by Congress or a future president). This of course is not the case. The talks were between Iran and the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council (United States, United Kingdom, France, China and Russia) plus Germany, dubbed the P5+1. While the United States has played a leading role in the effort, it negotiated the terms alongside its partners. If the agreement reached by the P5+1 is rejected by Congress, it could result in an unraveling of the sanctions on Iran and threaten NATO cohesion in other areas. Another questionable assertion is that this agreement contains a sunset clause, after which Iran will be free to do as it pleases. Again, this is not the case. Some of the restrictions on Iran's nuclear activities, such as uranium enrichment, will be eased or eliminated over time, as long as 15 years. But most importantly, the framework agreement includes Iran's ratification of the Additional Protocol, which allows IAEA inspectors expanded access to nuclear sites both declared and nondeclared. This provision will be permanent. It does not sunset. Thus, going forward, if Iran decides to enrich uranium to weapons-grade levels, monitors will be able to detect such a move in a matter of days and alert the U.N. Security Council. Many in Congress have said that the agreement should be a formal treaty requiring the Senate to "advise and consent." But the issue is not suited for a treaty. Treaties impose equivalent obligations on all signatories. For example, the New START treaty limits Russia and the United States to 1,550 deployed strategic warheads. But any agreement with Iran will not be so balanced.  The restrictions and obligations in the final framework agreement will be imposed almost exclusively on Iran. The P5+1 are obligated only to ease and eventually remove most but not all economic sanctions, which were imposed as leverage to gain this final deal. Finally some insist that any agreement must address Iranian missile programs, human rights violations or support for Hamas or Hezbollah.  As important as these issues are, and they must indeed be addressed, they are unrelated to the most important aim of a nuclear deal: preventing a nuclear Iran.  To include them in the negotiations would be a poison pill. This agreement should be judged on its merits and on how it affects the security of our negotiating partners and allies, including Israel. Those judgments should be fact-based, not based on questionable assertions or dubious assumptions.

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence. The US and its partners have reached a framework agreement with Iran that limits its nuclear program, but there may be pushback from Congress and others who make dubious claims about the

Article: Los Angeles (CNN)It's more than just one state's internal problem. The historic California drought hurts the rest of the union, too. That's because California is a breadbasket to the nation, growing more than a third of its vegetables and nearly two-thirds of its fruits and nuts. Here's why we should heed the ongoing drought in the most populous state, a slowly expanding natural disaster now in its fourth year that this week prompted Gov. Jerry Brown to announce a mandatory 25% cutback in water consumption in all cities. In 2014, one expert predicted consumers would pay more for some groceries because of the California drought. He was often right, according to statistics gathered by Timothy Richards, agribusiness professor at Arizona State University. Prices rose last year for these items on your kitchen table:. • Berries rose in price by about 80 cents per clamshell to $3.88. • Broccoli by 11 cents per pound to $1.89. • Grapes by 64 cents a pound to $3.06. • Melons by 24 cents a pound to $1.23. • Packaged salad by 23 cents a bag to $2.91. • Peppers by 26 cents a pound to $2.39. Though fruits and vegetable prices fell in February, overall prices are expected to rise this year, because of inflation, U.S. Department of Agriculture economist Annemarie Kuhns said. Fresh fruit prices are projected to rise between 2.5% and 3.5%, and vegetables between 2% and 3%, close to historical average increases, Kuhns said. Whether the California drought will affect food prices again this year is unknown, thanks to a strong dollar. The greenback's strength allows producers to import crops that may be withering under the absence of West Coast rain or other misfortunes elsewhere in the nation, Kuhns said. Moreover, the drop in oil prices also eases the cost of transporting food from California to the other 49 states, she said. What economists don't know yet is whether farmers will plant fewer crops because of the drought. Those decisions are now being made in the field and could boost supermarket prices, she said. "The drought in California does have the potential to impact the price we pay for fresh fruit and fresh vegetables and dairy and fresh eggs we pay at the counter," Kuhns said. "We are not sure what the exact impact will be." The reality is there's a major drought throughout the West and Southwest. While not as bad as California, Texas and Oklahoma are also seeing extreme and exceptional drought -- the two worst categories -- in several parts of their states, the U.S. Drought Monitor said this week. Overall, the Western drought affects more than 52 million people, the monitor says. As a result, consumers paid a whopping extra 12.1% for beef and veal in 2014, the USDA reports. Straining under a drought that began in 2012, ranchers in Texas and Oklahoma last year saw smaller grazing pastures, paid more for feed, and experienced difficulties accessing water to cool their cattle. So the cattlemen began culling their herds, Kuhns said. This year's beef and veal prices should rise only by 6% at most, still higher than the 4.1% historical average, the feds project. But beef prices offer an object lesson about the drought. "There's other areas being affected," Kuhns said. It's called the Golden State for the gold rush of yore, but let's face it: the rest of the nation flocks to California for vacation because of another golden reason. Its year-round sunshine. So the next time you take a holiday in California, you'll find a few changes around here, thanks to the drought. Like asking for a glass of water at a restaurant. You won't find water waiting for you on the table. Eateries now "can only serve water to customers on request," the State Water Resources Control Board declared in March under expanded emergency regulations. Tourists can also expect to hear a lot of requests at hotels about whether they want their linens and towels laundered daily. These requests are mandatory under the new regulations. And they'll see fewer homes running decorative fountains. Because much of the snowpack in the Sierra Nevada has alarmingly disappeared, many ski resorts shut down early this year, including at Lake Tahoe, and some are now building zip lines, mountain bike trails and wedding venues to keep tourists coming, the Sacramento Bee reported. "If the drought continues through next winter and we do not conserve more, the consequences could be even more catastrophic than they already are," State Water Board Chair Felicia Marcus said in March. But what about those yummy California wines, you ask? Guess what. They're only getting better -- because of the drought. Yes, you read that right. The 2014 wine grape harvest was "third in a string of great vintages this decade," the Wine Institute says. "California vintners and growers across the state are grateful for another excellent vintage, despite an ongoing drought and earthquake that rocked south Napa in late August just as crush was getting underway," the institute said in a statement last year. "A mild winter and spring caused early bud break, although the overall length of the growing season was similar to past years." Wine grapes use relatively low water, said institute spokeswoman Gladys Horiuchi. "Yes, drought years tend to produce terrific quality," she added. "With the record high California wine grape harvests in 2012, 2013 and 2014, there is a good supply of California wine." That may be the only thing to toast about this drought.

Article: Sunday's trip to Loftus Road marks Chelsea’s 700th game under the ownership of Roman Abramovich, a period Jose Mourinho says has been positive not only for the club but for English football as a whole. Some would quibble with the second part of that statement, but Mourinho says that too will change. If the first 699 games under Russian rule has established Chelsea at the top of English and European football, Mourinho believes the next 700 will see them supply more players for the English national team as they implement Abramovich’s demand to follow Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules. Sunday's trip to Loftus Road marks Chelsea’s 700th game under the ownership of Roman Abramovich. Abramovich (right) celebrates with Frank Lampard (centre) and John Terry after Chelsea clinch their first Premier League title under his ownership in 2005. The Russian finally got his hands on the Champions League trophy following Chelsea's success in 2012. Mourinho also believes Chelsea’s adherence to FFP — ‘compared with other clubs and owners who didn’t want to play under the rules’, he pointed out in a thinly veiled dig at Manchester City — positions them as standard bearers for the English game. There can certainly be no doubt Chelsea are in a far stronger position than when Abramovich bought the club from Ken Bates for £140m on June 1, 2003. In the intervening 12 years he has spent in the region of £842.9m on transfer fees, winning three Premier Leagues, four FA Cups, three League Cups, one Europa League and one Champions League, but now, Mourinho says, Abramovich’s rule will benefit England as well as Chelsea. Jose Mourinho, seen here with Abramovich in 2004, has has been in charge of Chelsea for almost five of the Russian's 12 seasons at Stamford Bridge. The Blues have won three Premier Leagues, four FA Cups, three League Cups, one Europa League and one Champions League since 2004. ‘He has been good for Chelsea, good for English football, good for European football,’ said Mourinho, who has been in charge for almost five of those 12 seasons. ‘Chelsea after him became strong, a top club in the country and a top club in Europe. I think that’s very, very good. I think it’s important and I think it’s also important the message Mr Abramovich and this club are passing now. ‘The decision to accept the [Financial Fair Play] rules and play under the rules I think is a big decision compared with other clubs and other owners that didn’t accept the rules and didn’t want to play under the rules. Chelsea are in a far stronger position than when Abramovich bought the club from Ken Bates in 2003. ‘Will the next 700 games under him be good for the English national side? I believe so. In the first team, we had some important players in the national team. 'John Terry, Ashley Cole, Joe Cole, Frank Lampard, Wayne Bridge, Shaun Wright-Phillips. We had a nucleus of four, five players that were always in the national team. ‘Now we are going through a period where it’s just about Gary Cahill. But we have some young boys coming into the first-team. Ruben [Loftus-Cheek] is already here. Normally, in a few years they should be there [in the national side].’ Gary Cahill (above) is now Chelsea's only senior England international in the current first team squad. Mourinho believes the likes of Ruben Loftus-Cheek (left) and Dominic Solanke will represent Chelsea and England for years to come. Mourinho did not name them, but Dominic Solanke, Patrick Bamford, Lewis Baker and Isaiah Brown are thought to be highly-rated at Chelsea, who supply many of the players in England’s age-group teams. The question is whether their young English players will be given the chance in the first team at a club who can take a huge step towards the title by winning at QPR today. It is a game Chelsea go into mindful of decisive slips in last season’s title race but with the title firmly in their own hands now, Mourinho is confident no mistakes will be made. Chelsea are on the verge of a domestic double after picking up the Capital One Cup in March. Mourinho has won seven major trophies while in charge of the west London club. He added: ‘Don’t make me remember the game against Sunderland because that was the game which stopped us fighting for the title. I don’t want to speak again about that game. ‘Last season we were depending on others. We needed this team to lose a couple of points here, a couple of points there. This situation is different. ‘Now we are in a position where we can be isolated of everything. We don’t have to be watching Man City against Man United. We don’t have to be waiting for what they are going to do. It’s just us.’ Fabio Borini celebrates scoring the winning goal during Sunderland's 2-1 win against Chelsea last season. Mourinho believes last season's defeat against Sunderland'stopped' Chelsea from fighting for the title.

Roman Abramovich has been Chelsea owner for 699 games. Chelsea face Premier League clash against QPR on Sunday. Blues have won 14 major trophies since the Russian's arrival in 2003.

Article: (CNN)The FBI charged a Philadelphia woman on Thursday with trying to travel overseas to fight for ISIS. She's one of three women arrested this week on terror charges. Two New York women were also taken into custody. An FBI complaint cites numerous social media messages dating back to August 2013 that were sent by Keonna Thomas, 30, also known as "Young Lioness" and "Fatayat Al Khilafah." One Twitter message said, "If we truly knew the realities... we all would be rushing to join our brothers in the front lines pray ALLAH accept us as shuhada [martyrs]." Another said, "When you're a mujahid [violent jihadi fighter] your death becomes a wedding." The FBI said Thomas purchased an electronic visa to Turkey on March 23. Turkey is known as the easiest place from which to enter Syria and join ISIS. An ISIS manual advises recruits to buy round-trip tickets to vacation spots such as Spain and then purchase tickets for their real destination once they arrive overseas, the FBI said. On March 26, Thomas purchased a ticket to Barcelona, with a March 29 departure and an April 15 return to the United States, the complaint said. It's not clear when or where she was arrested. She was charged with knowingly attempting to provide material support and resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization. She could be sentenced to 15 years in prison. On Thursday, Noelle Velentzas, 28, and her former roommate, Asia Siddiqui, 31, were arrested in New York and accused of planning to build an explosive device for attacks in the United States, federal prosecutors said. In the past 18 months, the Justice Department's National Security Division has prosecuted or is prosecuting more than 30 cases of people attempting to travel abroad to join or provide support to terrorist groups. Of those cases, 18 allegedly involve support to ISIS. "The terrorist threat is more decentralized, more diffuse, more complicated," Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told reporters Thursday. "It involves the potential lone wolf actor, it involves the effective use of social media, the Internet."

Article: (CNN)Since Iran's Islamic Revolution in 1979, women have been barred from attending most sports events involving men. But the situation appears set to improve in the coming months after a top Iranian sports official said that the ban will be lifted for some events. A plan to allow "women and families" to enter sports stadiums will come into effect in the next year, Deputy Sports Minister Abdolhamid Ahmadi said Saturday, according to state-run media. But it isn't clear exactly which games women will be able to attend. According to the state-run Press TV, Ahmadi said the restrictions would be lifted for indoor sports events. The rules won't change for all matches because some sports are mainly related to men and "families are not interested in attending" them, Press TV cited him as saying. Iranian authorities imposed the ban on women attending men's sports events after the revolution, deeming that mixed crowds watching games together was un-Islamic. During the ensuing decades, the crowds at soccer games, Iran's most popular sport, have been all male. Iranian women were briefly permitted to attend volleyball matches under the moderate President Mohammad Khatami, but the ban was reinstated in 2005 after the more hard-line Mahmoud Ahmadinejad came to power. The Iranian government has come under pressure from international sports officials over the restrictions. FIFA President Sepp Blatter called on Iran last month to end its "intolerable" ban on women attending soccer matches, saying the situation "cannot continue." Iran had been in the running to host the 2019 edition of soccer's Asian Cup, but the tournament was awarded to the United Arab Emirates. The ban on women attending matches was widely seen as a major impediment to Iran's chances of securing the event. The ban came under the spotlight at the Asian Cup in Australia earlier this year, when thousands of female Iranian fans watched their soccer team without restriction. During the match against Iraq, activists called for the ban to end and unfurled a banner showing the face of Ghoncheh Ghavami, a British-Iranian woman detained in Iran last year while trying to watch a volleyball match. Iranian officials have denied that Ghavami was arrested for attending the volleyball game, saying she was taken into custody for "anti-Iran activities." The news agency Reuters reported that she was recently pardoned by the Court of Appeal. CNN's Annie Ramos contributed to this report.

Article: Lewis Hamilton's love of the Shanghai International Circuit continues to show no bounds as the reigning Formula One champion again claimed pole position for the race. Hamilton now has a record five poles to his name at the track, and three in succession, to take his tally to 41 overall in his career. The 30-year-old Briton ultimately finished just 0.042secs ahead of his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg to give the team another front-row lock out. Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel, a surprise winner last time out in Malaysia, will start third, albeit down by nine tenths of a second on Hamilton. Now click here to read the full qualifying report. Host commentator. Thank you for joining us this morning and be sure to return tomorrow for our coverage of Sunday’s race. 1 Hamilton; 2 Rosberg; 3 Vettel; 4 Massa; 5 Bottas; 6 Raikkonen; 7 Ricciardo; 8 Grosjean; 9 Nasr; 10 Ericsson. ‘Oh come on, guys’, Rosberg exasperates after missing out on pole by 0.042secs. Hamilton fails to improve on his time, but it doesn’t matter as Rosberg can’t beat his lap. It is Hamilton’s pole. Back on track and all 10 drivers are out for their final runs and they’re all on fresh tyres. Here we go…. Meanwhile... Vettel crosses the line to go fourth fastest as he splits the Williams pair of Massa and Bottas. We’ve got four minutes to run. The Mercedes pair are so much quicker than the rest of the field here. Raikkonen is the first of the Ferrari drivers to post a time and he is the best part of two seconds slower than Hamilton on a used set of option tyres. And Hamilton crosses the line with a 1:35.782. Wow. What can Rosberg do? The Mercedes man is 0.280secs slower than his team-mate. Bottas is the first driver to post a competitive lap, and he crosses the start-finish line with a 1:37.903… but it is Hamilton up next. We’ll see two runs from each driver and Hamilton is the first of the Mercedes pair to take to the track. So, we’re already underway with the final session to determine the top 10… surely, Lewis Hamilton won’t be stopped in his quest for a third straight pole this year? So, surprisingly both Toro Rossos fail to make the top-10 shootout with Verstappen and Sainz to start 13th and 14th tomorrow. Hamilton remains the quickest man on the track. So, we’re in the last minute of Q2 and Massa, Ericsson, Nasr and Perez are facing the drop. Vettel crosses the line to go faster than Raikkonen,  but he is half-a-second off Hamilton’s mighty lap. Raikkonen goes third-fastest with a 1:37.1, but the Finn is seven tenths slower than Hamilton… what can Vettel do in the sister Ferrari? Neither Ferrari driver are yet to post a time, so the best of the rest behind the Mercedes pair is currently the Lotus of Romain Grosjean, 1.6 seconds slower than Hamilton. That really is a stunning time from the world champion. Rosberg follows Hamilton across the line, but he is three tenths slower than his Mercedes team-mate. The Briton really appears to be a class above his Mercedes team-mate this weekend. Valtteri Bottas leads the way until Hamilton posts a 1:36.423 with his first run of the afternoon on the soft-option tyre. He then reports that his seat was getting really warm on that lap; a problem he mentioned during practice this morning. The second session is underway in Shanghai to determine which drivers will make it through to the top-10 shootout. That’s quite a big shock to see McLaren on the penultimate row again. Button, Alonso and the team have been speaking with plenty of optimism this weekend, but they will start tomorrow’s race only 17th and 18th. So, the McLaren drivers do not make it out of Q1 and Button and Alonso will start on the penultimate row for tomorrow's Chinese Grand Prix. But as I write that, Vettel goes fastest with a 1:37.502. Carlos Sainz, Pastor Maldonado, Romain Grosjean, Will Stevens and Roberto Merhi occupy the drop zone with a minute to go…. Raikkonen is back on track, on the softs, and it is the Finn’s turn to top the timesheets as he goes some two tenths faster than Bottas. Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa are both on the option tyres for their first timed runs of the afternoon. Bottas goes fastest with a 1:38.014 as Massa slots into third. Button, also on the soft compound, is faster than Alonso by four tenths, and he slots his McLaren into P7. The Briton comes over the radio to complain that the ‘rears are overheating’. Alonso is already donning the soft compound tyre. He comes across plenty of traffic on his fast lap, but still manages to go eighth… for now. So, with 10 minutes to go, Hamilton leads the way from Rosberg, Hulkenberg, Felipe Nasr, Vettel, Raikkonen and the ever-impressive Max Verstappen. Rosberg is the next driver to cross the line and he posts a lap of 1:38.496 which is some two tenths off his team-mate. Nico Hulkenberg, on the much faster softer compound tyre, pops his Force India into third. Here comes Hamilton, who looks at ease in his Mercedes, and the British driver is 1.6 seconds faster than Vettel. Ouch. Raikkonen crosses the line to post a 1:40.917, but he appeared to be struggling with plenty of understeer on that lap and Vettel crosses the line to go one second quicker than his Ferrari team-mate. Plenty of smoke as Lewis Hamilton’s Mercedes is fired up, but there’s no problem with the world champion’s Silver Arrows as he takes to the circuit for Q1. Kimi Raikkonen meanwhile is the first big gun out on a hot lap…. Fernando Alonso failed to post a time in this morning's practice session, but the Spaniard is first out of the blocks as today's qualifying session gets underway. Security has been ramped up for this week’s race in China after a spectator managed to get on to the track during yesterday’s second practice session. The local man darted across the start-finish line before leaping over the pit wall and walking into the Ferrari garage. He is then alleged to have said: ‘I want a car. I’ve got a ticket.’ Rosberg has been challenged by Mercedes F1 chairman Niki Lauda to raise his game this weekend after being outclassed by Hamilton in both races so far this term. Here, the German is taking part in his traditional warm-up before hopping into his Mercedes for this afternoon’s qualifying session. That said, Mercedes, and Lewis Hamilton in particular, appear to be back to their ominous best in Shanghai. Hamilton has been fastest in all three practice sessions this weekend at a track where he has already won on three occasions and was the pole-sitter here in 2013 and again last year. The 30-year-old posted a time of one minute 37.615secs, finishing 0.226secs quicker than team-mate Rosberg. Fresh from his win in Sepang, Vettel was the best of the rest, albeit some seven tenths down on Hamilton’s best lap. Good morning and welcome to our coverage of today’s qualifying session for the Chinese Grand Prix. After Lewis Hamilton led Nico Rosberg home in a Mercedes one-two at the curtain raiser in Melbourne, we were told a year of domination from the Silver Arrows loomed. But how wrong they  were. Sebastian Vettel, in his Ferrari, upset the odds to roar to victory in Malaysia to blow the race for the championship back open and give Mercedes food-for-thought ahead of this week’s Chinese Grand Prix and for the remainder of the campaign.

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence.
Lewis Hamilton claimed his third straight pole position of the season. Nico Rosberg was just 0.042secs slower than his Mercedes team-mate. German says: 'Oh, come on, guys,' when told he is slower than Hamilton. Sebastian Vettel will start third for Ferrari with Felipe Massa fourth. McLaren endured another difficult day with Jenson Button and Fernando Alonso only 17th and 18th on the grid for Sunday's race.

Article: (CNN)Just as mimeograph machines and photocopiers were in their day, online activity -- blogs, YouTube channels, even social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter -- have fully emerged as the alternative to traditional mainstream media. It is not just the low cost of posting online that attracts dissidence, though that in itself is liberating. It is the lack of access to traditional print and broadcast media in authoritarian countries that is really the driving force leading disaffected voices to post online. It is not unique to Asia, but it might seem more pronounced if you live there. Going online has become the path of least resistance if you want to make yourself heard. But it still brings resistance, some of it legal, some of it deadly. Let's look at the legal angle first. Amos Yee, the teenage video blogger who was arrested and held pending bail Sunday in Singapore, drew international attention for his anti-Lee Kuan Yew harangue. But jailing critics is not usually the government's first choice in Singapore. It is part of Lee Kuan Yew's legacy that the government's use of the courts to bring libel and defamation cases, usually carrying heavy financial penalties, is the preferred method of silencing discomfiting online voices. His father has reportedly apologized for his son's behavior, but the younger Yee could face up to three years in jail. Yee is not unique. Another dissident blogger in Singapore, Roy Ngerng, continues to suffer financial and legal pressure, including the loss of his job, because of a blog post that allegedly accused the city-state's Prime Minister, Lee Hsien Loong, of corruption. Ngerng's concern is with the lack of transparency in the management of the Central Provident Fund, the government's compulsory pension program. Yee and Ngerng are two of many. The Committee To Protect Journalists' file on Singapore going back to 2000 has a long string of similar cases, some against politicians, others against citizens simply frustrated with their government. But it is not just Singapore where Internet activity comes under fire: On Monday in Malaysia, with much less of the international attention heaped on Amos Yee, five editors and executives from The Malaysian Insider were arrested over the site's March 25 report claiming that a senior council of royal rulers and state governors, known as the Conference of Rulers, had rejected a proposal to amend federal law to allow for the introduction of hudud, or punishments meted out under Islamic law. In deeply Muslim Malaysia, questions of Islamic faith are a third-rail issue, as is revealing government decisions before they are announced. By far the biggest jailer of journalists in the world is China, where a majority of the 44 people behind bars at the end of 2014 were bloggers, most of them Uighur or Tibetan activists who straddle the line between journalism and activism. But in second place in Asia is Vietnam, where CPJ's most recent prison census showed Vietnam holding 16 reporters behind bars as of December 1. Add one more in late December, Nguyen Dinh Ngoc, a prominent blogger who was arrested for "law-violating" after police searched his home in southern Ho Chi Minh City on December 27, and two more in January, Nguyen Quang Lap and Hong Le Tho, arrested on anti-state charges of "abusing democratic freedoms" and you can see the pattern. Because the print and broadcast media are so totally government controlled, mainstream journalists seldom go to jail any more in Vietnam. Only two investigative print reporters remain behind bars in Vietnam, their cases dating back to 2012 and 2013. Both were accused of accepting bribes for dialing back critical news coverage. The list could go on, but the reality is that, as CPJ wrote in 2013, across Asia "governments have curtailed Internet freedoms through increasingly restrictive practices, including prohibitive laws, heightened surveillance and censorship, and threats of imprisonment on various national security-related offenses." That is still the policy path being followed by most countries in Asia, and it does not look like it will be changing any time soon. Jailing journalists is one thing, but watching them being killed and doing little or nothing about it is another. Since 1992, 11% of journalists killed have died for their work online. Because our 1992 start date really precedes the full advent of the Internet, that proportion can be expected to grow. While most bloggers have not been the targets of murderers, Bangladesh has recently become the exception. On Monday, Washiqur Rahman Babu was the second blogger to be hacked to death in public in Bangladesh in the past five weeks. Blogger Avijit Roy and his wife, Rafida Ahmed Bonna, were attacked by assailants wielding sharp weapons while the couple was visiting Dhaka. Roy, a U.S. citizen of Bangladeshi origin, was killed and his wife was critically injured. Both Rahman and Roy had written critically on Islamic matters. The blogger death toll gets higher in Bangladesh if you go back a year or two, and religious beliefs are always involved, and the killings almost always carried out with near perfect impunity. In January 2013, blogger Asif Mohiuddin, who wrote critical commentary on religion, Islamist groups, free speech, and human rights, barely survived after he was stabbed by Islamists. In February 2013, blogger Ahmed Rajib Haider, who had written about Islamic fundamentalism and Islamist groups, was hacked to death by members of an Islamist militant group, according to police investigations. Later in 2013, Islamist groups called for the execution of bloggers they said had committed blasphemy. While arrests were made after those murders, there have been no convictions. The bottom line: Online journalists, operating outside the restraints of mainstream media, have become the most vulnerable targets for governments and independent actors. Where there is the restrictive rule of law, journalists are vulnerable to the anger of officialdom. Where the rule of law is weak, they are vulnerable to the attacks of killers who seldom, if ever, answer to the rule of law.

Article: (CNN)When singer Avril Lavigne went missing from the music scene, there was tons of speculation. Was she pregnant? In rehab? Going through a split from her husband, Nickelback front man Chad Kroeger? Focus on the mystery intensified in December after a fan Twitter account posted a direct message from Lavigne when she solicited prayers, saying she was "having some health issues." Now the Canadian singer has revealed to People magazine that she was bedridden for five months after contracting Lyme disease. "I felt like I couldn't breathe, I couldn't talk, and I couldn't move," she told the magazine. "I thought I was dying." Lyme disease: What you should know. Lavigne believes that she was bitten by a tick last spring. What followed was months of lightheadedness and lethargy that doctors were initially unable to diagnose. The 30-year-old performer said she recuperated in her Ontario home, where her husband would use tour breaks to care for her and her mother moved in to assist. "There were definitely times I couldn't shower for a full week because I could barely stand," she told People. "It felt like having all your life sucked out of you." Opinion: Why you should be afraid of Lyme disease. After her direct message about her health went viral, Lavigne was inundated with concern from fans. "The get-well messages and videos they sent touched me so deeply," she said. Now declaring herself "80 percent better," Lavigne is releasing a new single this month to support the 2015 Special Olympics and says that being ill was a "wake-up call" that has given her a new perspective. "I really just want to enjoy life from here on out," she said.

Article: A man accused of chopping up his friend's body and dumping his severed head in an apartment block's recycling bin had previously started a bloody fight at his gym, it has emerged. Carlos Colina, 32, is being held on $1 million bail after pleading not guilty to aggravated assault and battery and improper disposal of a human body in Cambridge, Massachusetts on Monday. The remains of Jonathan Camilien, 26, including a torso and limbs, were found in a duffel bag near the campus of Massachusetts Institute of Technology on Saturday morning before his head was found in Colina's apartment building across the street, according to the police report. Now the Boston Herald has unearthed police reports and witness accounts showing Colina had intimidated fellow gym users and even fought them before being thrown out. Accused: Carlos Colina is pictured at his arraignment in Cambridge, Massachusetts on Monday after human body parts were discovered in a duffel bag and a head was found in his building's recycling bin. Colina previously worked out at the Cambridge Athletic Club but was kicked out following a fight over gym equipment on November 24. A witness told the Herald how Colina started punching a much smaller man all over his body as the man unsuccessfully tried to fight back. He suffered bloody cuts to his head, the witness said. 'The trainers broke the fight up,' he said. 'Carlos gets up and starts walking away, yelling, "I'm a beast! I'm a beast!’ like he was proud of himself.' The victim suffered broken ribs in the attack, WHDH reported. Colina has an outstanding assault and battery case pending against him from the fight. The witness said that before the November incident, Colina stood and glared at other gym users if they were using gym equipment he wanted. 'Intimidating': Colina, pictured in photos he posted to Facebook, also has an outstanding assault and battery case pending against him after he allegedly attacked a fellow gym user last November. 'Threats': A witness said Colina had also intimidated other gym users when he wanted to use equipment. Colina is believed to have known his alleged victim; he is friends with his younger brother, Christopher Camilien, on Facebook. The two brothers lived together in Somerville. Middlesex District Attorney Marian Ryan said Camilien's death is considered a homicide, even though Colina has not been charged with murder. She said analysis of evidence and more information from the medical examiner are needed to determine if additional charges are warranted. 'We are not seeking anyone else in connection with the discovery of these human remains,' she said. No motive has been released. Colina and Camilien were last seen returning to the building just after 11pm on Friday, according to the investigation, and a neighbor reported hearing an argument coming from the apartment. Colina was seen in surveillance video from nearby Biogen offices exiting the apartment building at about 4.15am on Saturday carrying a duffel bag, authorities said. Scene: A vacuum could be heard inside his building, pictured, after police discovered the victim's head. Probe: Police stand by where the remains of Jonathan Camilien were discovered in Cambridge on Saturday. He returned to the apartment building empty handed. A saw, rope and cleaning supplies were found in Colina's apartment, which is located one block from the Cambridge Police Department. He also had wounds on his face and neck and a vacuum could be heard during the search when police discovered the victim's head, according to theBoston Globe. Defense attorney John Cunha Jr. called it a sensational case. 'Obviously the circumstances of the case are sensational enough,' he said. 'I'm not going to exacerbate it.' A pretrial hearing has been scheduled for April 14.

Article: Jack Nicklaus recorded his first ever hole-in-one at the Masters on Wednesday, as Camilo Villegas fired two in the space of five holes but still could not win the traditional par-three contest. Villegas holed out on the fourth and eighth as he finished alongside Kevin Streelman on five under par, only to find water on the eighth when he played it again as the third play-off hole. Kevin Streelman holds his trophy aloft after winning the Par-3 Contest on a play-off against Camilo Villegas. Streelman therefore became the latest player to be saddled with the 'curse' of the par-three champion, with no player ever becoming par-three and Masters champion in the same year. However, that was placed firmly into perspective thanks to his 11-year-old caddie Ethan Couch, who has a benign but inoperable brain tumour. Streelman found Couch via the Make-a-Wish Foundation and invited him to be his caddie in the light-hearted curtain-raiser. Augusta National's par-three course traditionally hosts the contest the day before start of the major. 'It was a really fun day, especially to have Ethan with me here,' Streelman said. 'This isn't about me today. It's about helping him out and showing him a great day.' Villegas said: 'I've made a few hole-in-ones, but it's pretty special to make them here. The second one, we were a little more emotional there. We just kind of jumped.' Nicklaus had earlier holed out with an eight iron from 123 yards on the fourth, his ball landing around 15 feet past the pin and spinning back into the hole. Woods played in the Masters par-three contest at Augusta National for the first time in 11 years. That took the 75-year-old six-time champion to three under par, but he would bogey the fifth and hit two balls into the water on the ninth to end his hopes of an unlikely triumph. Former US Open champion Curtis Strange reminded Nicklaus of the tradition that players who make a hole-in-one have to buy the drinks in the clubhouse when Nicklaus walked past the ESPN commentary position. 'Send me a bill,' Nicklaus replied. The Masters official Twitter account shared an image of Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods with Niall Horan. The 18-time major winner added on ESPN: 'I never had a hole in one at Augusta, in the par three (contest) or on the golf course. Doing an interview this morning I said all I have to do is go out there, make a hole-in-one and win the par three. I had it three under and then choked.' Since the contest started in 1960, nobody has ever become par-three and Masters champion in the same week, a fact which sometimes sees players deliberately not shoot the best score possible. Most treat it as light relief and invite family or friends to act as their caddies, including Tiger Woods this year for the first time since 2004. Woods had his children Charlie and Sam on his bag and made sure he could not win the event by getting daughter Sam to tap in for par on the sixth. Jack Nicklaus (centre) with Ben Crenshaw (left) and Gary Player (right) during the Par-3 Contest. 'We had an absolutely great time. These were memories for a lifetime,' said Woods, who was also accompanied by girlfriend Lindsey Vonn. He later added on Twitter: 'I'll always have memories of my pop at Augusta and now Sam & Charlie. An amazing day.' Tournament favourite Rory McIlroy had One Direction singer Niall Horan acting as his caddie and Horan proved he should stick to singing after badly hooking a tee shot on the ninth into the water. 'I apologise to golf,' Horan joked. 'I do perform to a lot of people but we were performing to their parents today! There was a lot of pressure.' McIlroy, who is looking to become the sixth player to complete the career grand slam by winning a first Masters title on Sunday, added: 'I wanted to do this because it's a big week for me and just to go into the tournament in a relaxed mood. To spend a couple of hours like this was fun.'

Article: Washington (CNN)Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the deal six world powers struck to thwart Iran's nuclear ambitions, saying he sees better options than "this bad deal or war." "I think there's a third alternative, and that is standing firm, ratcheting up the pressure until you get a better deal," Netanyahu told CNN's Jim Acosta Sunday on "State of the Union." His comments come as Democrats and Republicans spar over the framework announced last week to lift Western sanctions on Iran in exchange for the country dropping from 19,000 to 5,060 active centrifuges, limiting its highly enriched uranium, and increasing inspections. President Barack Obama endorsed the deal, saying it was better than the alternatives. But GOP contenders for the party's 2016 presidential nomination lambasted it, saying it gave Iran too much flexibility. On Sunday, the sparring continued. One Senate Democrat said Netanyahu needs to "contain himself." And a top Republican said almost any of Obama's successors as president "could do better." Netanyahu's most recent argument against the Iran nuclear deal was similar to the one he'd made in a March trip to Washington, when he addressed a joint session of Congress -- fueling a Republican push to have the deal sent to Congress before it's implemented. "It does not roll back Iran's nuclear program. It keeps a vast nuclear infrastructure in place. Not a single centrifuge is destroyed. Not a single nuclear facility is shut down, including the underground facilities that they built illicitly. Thousands of centrifuges will keep spinning, enriching uranium," Netanyahu said Sunday. "That's a very bad deal. " Netanyahu said Iran is a country of "congenital cheating" and that it can't be trusted to abide by the terms of the deal, which lasts 10 years with some provisions extending well beyond that. He said his opposition has little to do with his frosty relationship with Obama. "I think that we can have a legitimate difference of opinion on this, because I think Iran has shown to be completely distrustful," Netanyahu said. Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, meanwhile, said she wishes Netanyahu "would contain himself." The top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee said negotiators working on the deal -- from Iran and the United States, as well as Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany -- are "on the cusp of something that can be workable." "It's a framework. It has to be wrapped into a final agreement. There still can be some changes," Feinstein said. "But I don't think it's helpful for Israel to come out and oppose this one opportunity to change a major dynamic -- which is downhill, a downhill dynamic in this part of the world." Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz defended the deal in an appearance on CBS' "Face the Nation" on Sunday, saying it would extend from two months to one year the "breakout" time period -- the length of time it would take Iran to build a nuclear bomb. He said it also allows for the "almost instantaneous recognition of any attempt to evade the deal." "We have blocked all of these pathways to a bomb," he said. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said on "Face the Nation" that the best option for the United States is to keep current sanctions in place for two more years and then have a "new crack at it with a new president that doesn't have the baggage of Obama." And he said the alternatives to Obama on both sides -- with the exception of Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who's called for a less active U.S. role overseas -- would likely strike a better deal. "Hillary Clinton would do better. I think everybody on our side, except, maybe, Rand Paul, could do better," Graham said.

Article: As seasons go, this one has been pretty close to perfect for Bristol City. Runaway leaders in Sky Bet League One, they became the first team in the Football League to mathematically secure promotion on Tuesday night - and in sensational style. Hitting Bradford City for six of the best in their own backyard saw them triumphantly over the finishing line, although given their free-wheeling and free-scoring form the result really came as little surprise. Aden Flint celebrates with a bottle of Sky Bet champagne following Bristol City's promotion. City players are sprayed with champagne after securing promotion from League One. And there’s more. Add to that their memorable Johnstone’s Paint Trophy victory at Wembley last month - when Walsall were comfortably beaten 2-0 in the final - and you have a truly historic campaign for Steve Cotterill’s team. The season has been a personal triumph for tall, tattooed defender Aden Flint, who has played a central role in returning City to the Championship after two seasons away. His uncompromising defensive style has been combined with a knack of scoring from set-pieces, leading to 11 goals this season. Flint was on target at Wembley, fulfilling a childhood dream in the process, and also at Valley Parade on Tuesday. The Robins stars shower each other in their isotonic drinks following victory against Bradford City on Tuesday. Flint scores his side's fourth goal of the game as City earn an impressive 6-0 at Valley Parade. ‘When the players and the manager sat down at the start of the season, we had three aims,’ he tells Sportsmail. ‘The first was to win promotion back to the Championship, the second was to go up as champions and the third was to win the Johnstone's Paint Trophy. ‘We've managed to do two of the three and hopefully on Saturday we can achieve the other.’ That’s because City need another win to make absolutely sure they will be promoted as champions. The 25-year-old defender celebrates as the Robins earned promotion to the Championship in style. City manager Steve Cotterill celebrates promotion with a commemorative bottle of champagne. They currently lead Preston North End by 10 points but the Lancashire side have a game in hand and so three points are required against Coventry City at Ashton Gate this weekend. ‘Nobody wants that runners-up medal. The aim was always to go up as champions and we’re close to achieving that,’ Flint says. ‘We’ve had that winning habit and it’s a good one to get in to. We’ve been top of the league for most of the season and to drop down to second now would be disappointing.’ Seldom does one team dominate a division in this way. The lowest City have been placed is fifth and that was after their opening day fixture. The Robins have enjoyed a memorable season which has included lifting the Johnstone's Paint Trophy. Once again, Flint (right) made a huge contribution, giving City the lead against Walsall on March 22. Flint wheels away in celebration after sending his side on their way to another memorable victory. Cotterill (left) and Jay Emmanuel-Thomas look delighted as they celebrate with the trophy at Wembley. They kicked on from there and set a ferocious pace throughout the autumn. Since September 13th, there has only been one week when they haven’t been top of the pile and they have lost just three games in all competitions since the New Year. Not that success has been reserved for the league. They reached the fourth round of the FA Cup, losing narrowly to Premier League West Ham, and claimed the Trophy too in front of over 40,000 of their fans at Wembley. Flint said: ‘I think any player dreams of scoring and winning at Wembley. There really isn't a better feeling in football. It is right up there with the highlights in my career but I would say that if we win on Saturday and go up as champions, that will push Wembley out.’ The defender’s goalscoring exploits have come as a surprise but he’s quick to credit his team-mates for the service: ‘I didn't expect to score as many as five to be honest! Flint holds the JPT with pride as he celebrates the 2-0 victory against Walsall last month. The defender was also named the Sky Bet League 1 Player of the Month for March. ‘I've just found myself in the right place at the right time to get on the end of all those set-pieces that have been delivered by the lads. ‘Aaron Wilbraham has bags of experience with him and has scored over 20 goals this season. Luke Freeman and Marlon Pack have been providing plenty of assists, not just for me but for everyone. ‘But everyone has chipped in, it has been a collective effort. The team spirit here has been the best I've ever experienced and it's been an enjoyable season.’ Promotion back to the Championship could be just the beginning of an exciting chapter in the club’s 118-year history. Aaron Wilbraham (right) has scored 18 domestic goals for the high-flying Robins this season. Billionaire owner Steve Lansdown (left) is funding a renovation of the club’s Ashton Gate home. Billionaire owner Steve Lansdown, who made his fortune in financial services, is funding a renovation of the club’s Ashton Gate home to expand the capacity to 27,000 and make it Premier League-ready. And, according to Flint, that’s precisely where the club is aiming: ‘We aim high and should be in the Championship, if not higher than that. ‘It's a massive city, I didn't realise how big it is until I moved here. It's surprising that the place hasn't got a Premier League team and maybe we can change that. ‘The chairman and the manager certainly have the ambition to achieve that. Seeing Bournemouth and Brentford doing so well in the Championship, nobody expected that and, who knows what will happen when we get there next season.’

Bristol City have earned promotion to the Championship. 25-year-old Aden Flint has been crucial to their promotion push. Flint has chipped in with an impressive 11 goals so far this season.

Article: (CNN)Standing up for what you believe. What does it cost you? What do you gain? Memories Pizza in the Indiana town of Walkerton is finding out. The family-run restaurant finds itself at the center of the debate over the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act after its owners said they'd refuse to cater a same-sex couple's wedding. "If a gay couple was to come and they wanted us to bring pizzas to their wedding, we'd have to say no," Crystal O'Connor told CNN affiliate WBND-TV in South Bend. The statement struck at the heart of fears by critics, who said the new law would allow businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbians. They called for boycotts. But supporters also rallied. And by the end of the week, they had donated more than $842,000 for the business. Social media unloaded on the pizzeria in the community of 2,100 people that few folks outside northern Indiana knew existed before this week. RiskyLiberal tweeted: "Dear #MemoriesPizza. No. My boycotting your business because I don't like your religious bigotry is not a violation of your freedom to practice your religion." "Don't threaten #MemoriesPizza" tweeted Aღanda. "Just mock them for their ignorance." Bad reviews flooded the restaurant's Facebook page, most having little to do with the quality of the food.  Many too vulgar to share. "Do you really want to financially support a company that treats some of your fellow citizens like second class citizens? BOYCOTT MEMORIES PIZZA!!" said Rob Katz of Indianapolis.  "Let's hope they either rethink their policy or the free market puts them out of business." Anti-bigotry critics harass wrong pizzeria. But one outburst in particular shut down the restaurant Wednesday and was expected to do the same Thursday. "Who's going to Walkerton with me to burn down Memories Pizza?" Jessica Dooley of Goshen tweeted, according to the Walkerton Police Department. The account has been deleted since the tweet was posted. Detectives who investigated have recommended charges of harassment, intimidation and threats, according to Charles Kulp, assistant police chief. The mood was a bit more subdued on the streets of Walkerton. A man stood outside Memories simply holding a sign that reads "bigots." Jason Narducy bought $100 of pizza from another shop down the street and started handing it out, WBND reported. "Do you want some non-discriminatory pizza?" Narducy asked. But for every tweet and Facebook post taking Memories Pizza to task were words of support and a groundswell of financial support. "Because nothing says tolerance like threatening to kill Christians & burn down their businesses," said a tweet from Victor Nikki. "What's happening to #MemoriesPizza isn't the free market, it's a lynch mob," tweeted Savannah. "Cyber bulling isn't the same as taking your business elsewhere." Supporters rallied to a GoFundMe page in support of Memories Pizza. By the time the fundraiser ended late Friday, $842,387 had been raised. The purpose of the campaign is "to relieve the financial loss endured by the proprietors' stand for faith," according to  Lawrence Billy Jones II, the man who started it. For the O'Connors their stand was no pie in the sky dream. It wasn't calculated but was spurred by their beliefs, they told WBND. "That's a lifestyle that you choose. I choose to be heterosexual. They choose to be homosexual," Kevin O'Connor told the TV station. "You can't beat me over the head with something they choose to be." Faced with threats against business, they're still weighing the cost. CNN's Rob Frehse and Melanie Whitley contributed to this report.

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence. The O'Connor family, owners of Memories Pizza in Walkerton, Indiana, have been met with both support and backlash after stating their refusal to cater a same-sex couple's wedding due to their religious beliefs,

Article: (CNN)Police in the Indian city of Malegaon, in the western state of Maharashtra, are requiring identity cards for an unusual group of residents: Cattle. Following a recent state-wide ban on the sale and consumption of beef, authorities in the city have asked residents to take a'mugshot' of their cattle and submit it to the police. Along with the photograph, the residents have to give information about their animal's 'unique features,' such as the coloring and age of the cow, along with the length of its tail and other distinctive characteristics. Police officials believe this is the only way to solve cow slaughter cases and enforce the law. Cows are considered holy and revered by that state's majority Hindu population. "We are creating a database. If we get an information of a cow slaughter, we can quickly go to the resident's place and check whether it is there or not", Mahesh Sawai, Deputy Superintendent of Malegaon Police told CNN. "I believe this will be very effective" So far over 100 owners have complied with the police order and more are lining up outside police stations across the city to get their livestock photographed. The ruling came in the wake of a recent case of cow slaughter in Malegaon, where two men have been charged for killing the animal and and selling its meat. The Maharashtra Animal Preservation Bill now includes bans on the killing of bulls and bullocks in its list of non-bailable offenses. Even the consumption or sale of beef could now land you in prison for five years. The slaughter of buffaloes, however, is still permissible. However, beef traders in the country strongly reacted to the decision and called a month-long strike, which ended Wednesday. The traders refused to even slaughter buffaloes and deprive the state of all bovine meat. They have now vowed to file a case in the state's high court. Red meat lovers weren't too delighted either, arguing the government doesn't have a right to interfere in an individual's personal preference. Maharashtra is not the only Indian state to tighten its laws on cow slaughter. Haryana state has implemented a maximum punishment of 10 years in prison, the toughest penalty in the country. Rajnath Singh, India's Home Minister has promised that he would do all to devise a country-wide law against cow slaughter.

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence. Police in Malegaon, India, are requiring residents to take "mugshots" of their cattle and submit them to the authorities in order to create a database to help solve cow slaughter cases and enforce a recent state-wide ban on the sale and

Article: Classical singer Camilla Kerslake was centre of attention at Sunday's Olivier Awards after she suffered a wardrobe malfunction as she arrived with England rugby skipper boyfriend Chris Robshaw. Wearing a daring, backless black dress, Camilla, 26, showed off more than she bargained for in her revealing floor-length gown. Despite being accompanied by Robshaw, who played for Harlequins in their 29-26 Premiership victory over Gloucester 24 hours earlier, the cameras were firmly trained on the singer. Scroll down for video. Daring: Camilla Kerslake showed off more than she bargained for in a daring backless gown at the Olivier Awards with MasterCard in London on Sunday where she was accompanied by Chris Robshaw. Posing with their arms around each other, the 'pre-engaged' couple looked the picture of happiness. 'Chris and I are on the same page and we definitely plan to get married in the near future,' the singer recently told The Mail on Sunday in her first interview about her famous boyfriend. 'Some people call it a pre-engagement. It's all about timing – at the moment we're both so busy with work. Pre-engaged: Camilla was joined by her England rugby captain boyfriend Chris Robshaw but her dress was the focus of attention. 'I even had to spend Valentine's Day outside in the cold sandwiched between hordes of angry men as I cheered Chris on during his game.' 'Pre-engagement' is a growing trend, with thousands of couples now choosing 'promise' rings ahead of a formal proposal. Camilla, though, has her eye on the real thing, and has been spotted scouting engagement rocks at Tiffany. Racy: Camilla flashed more than hint of sideboob in her dramatically racy floor-length gown. One way to get attention: Kerslake's dress made sure she stood out on the star-studded red carpet. So far, her  6ft 2in boyfriend has been notably reticent when friends have quizzed him on the subject. But Camilla appears undeterred. 'It's tricky now as I'm currently locked away in the studio recording my third album and Chris is obviously incredibly busy and focused on his rugby and the Six Nations. 'But he gets back from England camp in April and the Six Nations boys have some time off in May and weekends off in June, so we'll have more time to ourselves then,' she added. 'As soon as things calm down for both of us work-wise, we'll start making plans.' Tight game: Robshaw (not pictured) played for his club Harlequins against Gloucester on Saturday. Loved up: The happy couple cosied up to each other as they arrived for the awards in London on Sunday. Meanwhile, Memphis: The Musical and Carole King show Beautiful lead the race for Britain's equivalent of Broadway's Tonys, with a clutch of nominations each, including best new musical. Memphis, set in the segregated 1950s American South, has nine nominations, including best actress in a musical for soul-singer star Beverley Knight. Beautiful has eight, with Katie Brayben a contender for her performance as chart-topping songwriter King. The other nominees for best new musical are Sunny Afternoon, the story of The Kinks, and Imelda Marcos-inspired Here Lies Love, created by David Byrne and Fatboy Slim. Inseparable: The classical singer met Chris when she performed at a charity dinner in 2011. Leaving little to the imagination: The dress showed off every inch of the blonde singer's body. Best-actress nominees are Gillian Anderson for A Streetcar Named Desire, Kristin Scott Thomas for Electra, Imelda Staunton for Good People and Penelope Wilton for Taken at Midnight. Best actor contenders are James McAvoy for The Ruling Class, Tim Pigott-Smith for King Charles III, Mark Strong for A View from the Bridge and Richard Armitage for The Crucible. Former X Factor judge Nicole Scherzinger is guaranteed an ovation when she takes to the stage at tonight's Olivier Awards, but could be going home with a gong as well after she was nominated for her role in the revival of Cats. The singer will share the bill with names including Talking Heads frontman David Byrne, Downton Abbey's Laura Carmichael, Dame Judi Dench, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Pixie Lott and Russell Tovey. A beauty: She styled her blonde hair to one side, while wearing dramatic red lipstick and taupe eyewear to give the look a perfect flourish. Scherzinger, nominated for best supporting actress in a musical for her role as Grizabella in Cats, will perform Memory from the hit show. There will be huge cheers if there is a win for 89-year-old Angela Lansbury, up for best supporting actress for playing scatterbrained psychic Madame Arcati in Blithe Spirit. Other nominees include Gemma Arterton who is up for best actress in a musical for her Made In Dagenham performance - her first onstage singing role - as factory worker Rita O'Grady. She is pitted against Tamsin Greig (Women On The Verge Of A Nervous Breakdown), Beverley Knight (Memphis The Musical) and Katie Brayben (Beautiful - The Carole King Musical). New productions Memphis The Musical and Beautiful - The Carole King Musical lead the nominations for individual productions, with nine and eight nods respectively. Pose for cameras: She happily perfected her red pout as she made her way down the red carpet. Beaming: The gorgeous couple looked to be in great spirits as they arrived together at the star-studded event.

Article: (CNN)It's the kind of thing you see in movies, like Robert Redford's role in "All Is Lost" or Ang Lee's "Life of Pi." But, in real life, it's hard to swallow the idea of a single person being stranded at sea for days, weeks, if not months and somehow living to talk about it. Miracles do happen, though, and not just in Hollywood. We're not talking about people who float aimlessly or run aground after running out of gas or being let down by faltering winds only to be picked up a few hours later by the U.S. Coast Guard. Much rarer are cases in which individuals become lost at sea long enough that they run out of whatever food and drinking water they'd brought aboard, if any. In order to survive, they can't bank on technology or the proximity of a nearby city, town or boat -- but instead must rely on ingenuity, resourcefulness and luck. It's hard to say how many of these types of stories end sadly, with a sailor dying at sea, except that it is a much higher number than those that end in rescues. Such happy endings do occur -- given what rescue agencies have reported and assuming you believe what any sole survivor says, a big qualifier since typically no one else can prove or refute their accounts. Below are a few recent examples:. Louis Jordan says that he set off on his 35-foot sailboat from South Carolina in late January. He headed into the Gulf Stream looking for a good spot to catch fish. And then everything -- his boat, his life -- turned upside down. Rescued man says he is 'utterly thankful' Not only did his boat capsize, but its mast broke, Jordan said. And so, too, did his shoulder. He bought time by rationing water, then collecting fresh water in a bucket. As to food, Jordan says he used laundry to trap and scoop up fish. And he rigged a makeshift mast and sail. But, Jordan said, "It took so long. It moved so slowly." His sailboat would capsize two more times before crew members on a German-flagged container ship, the Houston Express, spotted Jordan about 200 miles off the North Carolina coast on Thursday. After their reunion, his father greeted him with a hug and an admission every parent dreads. "I thought I lost you." Jose Salvador Alvarenga says his journey began in Paredon Viejo, a port on Mexico's Pacific coast, in late 2012. The exact date is up for debate -- he says he set off in December, locals say it was November. But what's not in doubt is that, after he left, he disappeared. Until January 2013. That's when Alvarenga interacted with humans once again, thousands of miles away on a remote atoll in the Marshall Islands. Castaway recounts how he survived over a year adrift in Pacific. What was supposed to be a one-day trip, he says, turned into an arduous odyssey across the Pacific Ocean, one that saw him lose his fishing companion and tested his will and ability to survive. His nightmare began when winds blew the pair off course. Then a storm hit causing their boat, which was about three people long and one wide, to lose its engine and use of its radio communication and GPS systems. Four weeks in, Alvarenga said his partner -- 23-year-old Ezequiel Cordova, according to the boat's owner -- died because he refused to eat raw birds. The days, weeks and months ran together after that. Alvarenga says he drank rainwater and, when there wasn't any available, his own urine. He ate sea turtles. Then, after 13 or 14 months adrift, he and his small, heavily damaged boat arrived on the Ebon Atoll, about a 22-hour boat ride from the Marshall Islands capital of Majuro. The atoll has one phone line, no Internet service and a few residents, two of whom Alvarenga spotted and shouted to after spending a night in the woods. The El Salvador native told CNN that his faith in God helped him survive. "I thought, 'I am going to get out," he said. "Get out, get out, get out." Some in their late 60s might relax in their retirement, reining it in a few notches as life slows down. And if you live in Hawaii, there's even more reason to take it easy. The thing is: Ron Ingraham isn't one of those people. He's a fisherman. The sea is both his life and livelihood, his son, Zakary, told CNN. And he's tough, with his son jokingly comparing him to Rambo. Still, even the hardiest fishermen would have been tested by what Ron Ingraham went through after setting off around last Thanksgiving solo from the Hawaiian island of Molokai. Son vindicated as father rescued after 12 days at sea. After bad weather hit, Ron Ingraham told CNN affiliate KHNL/KGMB that his 25-foot sailboat went "backwards all night long." At one point, a huge wave struck -- pushing his mast into the water and him as well. The 67-year-old used a rope to pull himself back in. But his boat couldn't be rescued so easily, leaving him at the mercy of the current. A distress call went out, prompting a search that would cover 12,000 square miles. When a Coast Guard official told him the search was being called off December 1, Zakary Ingraham responded, "I don't feel like he's dead. I don't feel it." He was right. Twelve days after that first distress call, Ron Ingraham was picked up about 64 miles (103 kilometers) south of Honolulu "weak, hungry and dehydrated" and -- most importantly -- alive. The veteran fisherman headed back to shore only after getting assurances his damaged boat would come with him. In February 2012, two friends asked 18-year-old Adrian Vasquez whether he wanted to tag along on an overnight fishing expedition. He said yes, and the three set off from the Panama town of San Carlos on a small boat, Vasquez's mother, Nilsa de la Cruz, recalled. Things started out well, by all accounts. The three caught plenty of fish. Then, their boat's engine died without warning. And, with no tools and scant navigational experience, the trio didn't know what to do, according to Vasquez's mother. Mother calls Panama teen's return 'a miracle' Vazquez ate raw fish and drank rainwater as currents swept his boat, the Fifty Cents, further and further from the coast and into the Pacific Ocean. Somewhere along the way, his two companions died. It's not clear exactly how, with Ecuadorian Rear. Adm. Freddy Garcia Calle saying Vasquez threw their bodies into the sea "because they had become badly decomposed." Some 26 days after and nearly 600 miles away from where the journey began, fishermen spotted the tiny vessel north of the Galapagos Islands. The Ecuadorian navy came in and picked up the teenage survivor, who'd lost 20 pounds and showed "severe signs of dehydration and lack of nutrition," according to Calle. He returned home to loved ones eager to embrace him, but mindful of giving him time to process the ordeal. "For us, this is an opportunity to get closer as a family," his mother said by phone, "to be more understanding and loving." Sometimes one doesn't have to be in the ocean for weeks to have his or her life imperiled. Sometimes people don't have to set off by boat to have the sea challenge them to the end. For proof, look no further than Hiromitsu Shinkawa. 60-year-old man waves red flag to alert rescuers. He was at home on March 11, 2011, when a massive 9.0 magnitude earthquake struck 231 miles northeast of Tokyo. A devastating tsunami followed, its 30-foot waves ravaging cities and towns and damaging several nuclear reactors. By the time it had run the course, nearly 16,000 people were dead. It's a miracle Shinkawa wasn't one of them. Shortly after the quake, he and his wife had gone to collect some belongings when the tsunami slammed their hometown of Minamisoma. His home was one of the tens of thousands destroyed by the the huge, powerful tsunami wave. "I was saved by holding onto the roof," the 60-year-old said, according to Kyodo News Agency. "But my wife was swept away.' More than two days later, video showed Shinkawa barely visible amid heaps of splintered wood, shattered homes and other debris floating more than nine miles (15 kilometers) out to sea. He was waving a self-made red flag. After being spotted by crew aboard a Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force destroyer and picked up in a smaller rescue boat, he took a drink offered to him and burst into tears, Kyodo reported. Shinkawa told his rescuers, "I thought today was the last day of my life."

Article: Didier Drogba has revealed he will continue his playing career next season. The Ivorian made a shock return to Chelsea last summer after leaving the club in 2012, signing a 12 month deal. But the Blues legend's future remains unclear with the club still to offer him a new contract. Didier Drogba revealed he is not planning to retire at the end of the season - whether he is at Chelsea or not. The 37-year-old (left) is yet to be offered an extension on his current 12-month deal at Stamford Bridge. Drogba (left) celebrates the Blues last gasp victory against QPR at Loftus Road on Sunday afternoon. However, Drogba, 37, insists he has no intention to retire at the end of the season - whether he is at Chelsea or not. 'I have made a decision, it's not my last season,' said Drogba. The veteran striker has been forced to settle for a bit-part role at Stamford Bridge this season after the summer arrivals of Diego Costa and Loic Remy. And he admits he finds sitting on the bench frustrating, saying: 'It's difficult when you don't play and then have to go into these kind of games. But I try to give my best. 'I tried to give the best of my physical capacity against QPR, so if the manager needs me I'm ready.' Despite his lack of action, Drogba looks certain to pick up his fourth Premier League title this season. Veteran striker Drogba (centre) insisted he tried to give the best of his physical capacity against QPR. And the forward, who started Sunday's win at QPR, added: 'We are only looking forward. We just wanted to win at QPR to get closer to the title. 'We still have those games against Manchester United and Arsenal to play. But we try to only think about our game. 'We are top of the league. They are maybe thinking about us and hoping we make a bad result. But we are more positive that we want to win. 'You want to feel that it's comfortable at the top, but when you look at the game against QPR, you know the gap can be closed easily within a game or two. 'So you have to stay focussed and give everything like we did.'

Article: (CNN)The world's biggest and most powerful physics experiment is taking place as you read this. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a particle accelerator and the largest machine in the world, is ready for action following a two-year shutdown. After problems that delayed the restart in March, scientists at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) completed final tests, enabling the first beams to start circulating Sunday inside the LHC's 17 mile (27 km) ring. "Operating accelerators for the benefit of the physics community is what CERN's here for," CERN Director-General Rolf Heuer said on the organization's website. "Today, CERN's heart beats once more to the rhythm of the LHC." The LHC generates up to 600 million particles per second, with a beam circulating for 10 hours, traveling more than 6 billion miles (more than 10 billion kilometers) -- the distance from Earth to Neptune and back again. At near light-speed, a proton in the LHC makes 11,245 circuits per second. It took thousands of scientists, engineers and technicians decades to devise and build the particle accelerator, housed in a tunnel between Lake Geneva and the Jura mountain range. The purpose of the lengthy project is to recreate the conditions that existed moments after the "Big Bang" -- the scientific theory said to explain the creation of the universe. By replicating the energy density and temperature, scientists hope to uncover how the universe evolved. Our current, limited, knowledge is based on what's called The Standard Model of particle physics.  "But we know that this model is not complete," Dr. Mike Lamont, operations group leader at the LHC, told CNN in March. The burning questions that remain include the origin of mass and why some particles are very heavy, while others have no mass at all; a unified description of all the fundamental forces such as gravity; and uncovering dark matter and dark energy, since visible matter accounts for only 4 percent of the universe. The LHC could also question the idea that the universe is only made of matter, despite the theory that antimatter must have been produced in the same amounts at the time of the Big Bang. CERN says the energies achievable by the LHC have only ever been found in nature. The machine alone costs approximately three billion euros (about $3.3 billion), paid for by member countries of CERN and contributions by non-member nations. The organization also asserts that its guidelines for the protection of the environment and personnel comply with standards set by Swiss and French laws and a European Council Directive. Scientists and physics enthusiasts will be waiting with bated breath as the LHC ventures into the great unknown. "After two years of effort, the LHC is in great shape," said CERN Director for Accelerators and Technology, Frédérick Bordry. "But the most important step is still to come when we increase the energy of the beams to new record levels." Peter Shadbolt contributed to this report.

Article: Veteran Leeds prop Kylie Leuluai is facing the prospect of another six weeks on the sidelines after being told he needs shoulder surgery. The 37-year-old New Zealander has not played since the Super League leaders' only defeat at Warrington a month ago but coach Brian McDermott says his injury has now been properly diagnosed. 'We thought his biceps were the problem but he's actually got a bit of floating tissue in his shoulder which he's going to have cleaned out,' McDermott said. Kylie Leuluai faces another six weeks out of action for the Leeds Rhinos after being told he needs surgery. 'He will be out for anything from between four to six weeks.' McDermott had feared Leuluai could be out for three months if he needed a bicep operation. 'It's great news,' McDermott added. 'He has still got an important role to play with us. 'I think we've missed him over Easter, not just the extra body, but some of the direct carries he gives you.'

Article: Atlanta (CNN)It was a scene worthy of any top cop show on TV -- bullets flying, banged-up cars and the FBI chasing an armed robbery suspect. In the end, two agents were injured in a crash and the suspect was shot before being captured. FBI agents and task force officers were following 36-year-old Kevone Charleston of Austell, Georgia, as he pulled into a CVS pharmacy in Forsyth County, Georgia, early Saturday. Charleston is suspected of involvement in 32 commercial robberies dating to November 2013, according to FBI officials. "The incident all happened around 7 o'clock Saturday morning," said FBI Special Agent Stephen Emmett. "There were multiple agents and officers that were following him based on his prior MO, and when they saw he was about to rob another CVS, they moved in." Authorities say Charleston parked his vehicle nearby and then popped the hood as if there were something wrong. Then he walked to the CVS, preparing to enter. When agents confronted him, Charleston ran, got in his car and traveled about 75 yards as agents opened fire. "There were several FBI vehicles that were rammed or were hit by the suspect's vehicle when he was trying to flee. One government vehicle sustained heavy damage to its front and side, and another government SUV ended up on its side. That's how the two agents sustained their injuries," Emmett said. Twelve FBI agents and six government vehicles followed Charleston. Emmett said Charleston "was trying to get away, our agents were trying to stop him. He collided with the first government vehicle, the Taurus, then the second, and the SUV ended on its side. "The perp was stopped 8 feet away in the median, and that's where he received his gunshot wounds." The two agents were treated at an area hospital and released, according to Emmett, who says "they are fine." Charleston was shot and wounded by FBI agents and task force officers, but his injuries are not life threatening, according to Forsyth County Sheriff's Deputy Robin Regan. Although he declined to give details of the 32 previous robberies, Emmett said it was an intensive investigation that was already underway as a priority for the FBI's violent crimes and major offender squad. He added, "His MO involved armed confrontations, so our officers went into this fully prepared for an armed confrontation based on his past history." Emmett says he's relieved that the FBI's officers and agents are OK and that the suspect is in custody. He said it was the "conclusion of an intensive and lengthy investigation." CNN's Vivian Kuo and Ryan Scallan contributed to this report.

Article: A litter of adorable baby foxes are being looked after they were discovered abandoned in a cardboard box in a car park in Pennsylvania. The newborn cubs were discovered by a woman passing the car park, who noticed the box sitting next to a clothing donation bin. When she peeped inside she saw seven baby foxes – thought to be only 10 days old – sitting together. Scroll down for video. The baby foxes are being looked after after they were discovered in a cardboard box, left by a clothing donation bin in a car park. The seven cubs weighed around six ounces each when they were taken in by the Pocono Wildlife Rehabilitation and Educational Center. Three of the rescued red foxes rest with a cuddly toy. Once they have grown and gained strength they will be released back into the wild. The cubs were taken to the Pocono Wildlife Rehabilitation and Educational Center in Stroudsbury, where they are now being cared for. Katherine Uhler, director of the center, said the little creatures -  five males and two females - were healthy but dehydrated when they arrived. She said: ‘They came in at about six ounces each. ‘There are five males, also known as dogs, and two girls known as vixens. ‘We know they're red foxes because even though they're not red yet, they still have this little white tail.’ The center is spending more than $1,000 looking after the foxes, who are being bottle-fed special 'fox milk' and formula. Ms Uhler added: ‘We had to give them rabies vaccinations and feed them fox milk. 'We gave them Pedialyte fluids first then mixed a quart of Fox Valley formula which is designed specifically for baby wild foxes. Vets at the center said they know the cubs are red foxes - among the most common of the species in America - because of their white tales. ‘We bottle feed them until they are a little bigger, then they'll start feeding out of the bowl. ‘When they're finished feeding out of the bowl then we'll start feeding them what they eat in the wild which is meat, and some vegetables and fruits.’ The pack will be returned back to the wild in July. It is costing the center in Pennsylvania more than $1,000 to take care of the group, which includes  five male and two female red foxes. The tiny animals were vaccinated against rabies and have been bottle-fed milk to build them up, before they will start feeding from a bowl.

Article: (CNN)Sky watchers in western North America are in for a treat: a nearly five-minute total lunar eclipse this morning. Here's how it's unfolding:. It started at 3:16 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time, when the moon began moving into Earth's shadow.  For the next hour and 45 minutes, that shadow will move across the moon and engulf it at 4:58 a.m. Pacific Time. The total eclipse will only last four minutes and 43 seconds, and NASA says that makes it the shortest one of the century. Watch it live on NASA TV. While people west of the Mississippi River will have the best view, at least a partial eclipse will be visible across the nation. But sunrise will interrupt the show on the East Coast. Parts of South America, India, China and Russia also will be able to see the eclipse, but it won't be visible in Greenland, Iceland, Europe, Africa or the Middle East. A lunar eclipse happens when the sun, Earth and moon form a straight line in space, with the Earth smack in the middle. The sun shines on the Earth and creates a shadow. As the moon moves deeper into that shadow, it appears to turn dark and may even appear to be a reddish color.  Why red? Because Earth's atmosphere is filtering out most of the blue light. Some people have nicknamed the effect the "blood moon." NASA says lunar eclipses typically happen at least twice a year, but this eclipse is the third in a series of four in a row, known as a "tetrad."  The first was on April 15, 2014. The second was in September 2014, the next is Saturday and there will be one more, on September 28. If you want to learn more about the eclipse, NASA astronomer Mitzi Adams will take questions on Twitter @NASA_Marshall. Did you see the total lunar eclipse? Share your photos with CNN iReport.

Article: Tiger Woods was genial. Tiger Woods was charm personified. Tiger Woods is the 111th best golfer in the world. You can grin your way through life as the 111th best golfer in the world. No pressure. No big whoop. Judging by some of the stuff said and written about Woods in the build-up to his 20th Masters, it will be an achievement if he makes the cut. Very respected names have close to begged him not to compete. Woods doesn’t see it like that at all. He’s in it to win it. And it’s in those little moments that the old Tiger — some would argue the real Tiger — breaks cover again. Tiger Woods was all smiles as he played a practice around ahead of his 20th appearance at the Masters. The former best player in the world arrives at Augusta ranked a lowly 111th in the game. Woods name appears on the Masters' tournament winner's board four times; 1997, 2001, 2002 and 2005. It was all smiles and wise-cracks as Woods sat before the assembled press on Tuesday. Questions that would once have been greeted with terse disregard were warmly expanded upon. Memory lane was tripped down, the elder statesman played. He even referred to some of the correspondents in the room as his friends. And then he was asked where a win this week, from one ranking place lower than Tomohiro Kondo of Japan, at a point in his career when it was wondered whether he would be seen on the golf course as a competing professional again, would rank in his career achievements. And up leapt old Tiger. He didn’t answer this one with a short, evocative speech or a ready quip. He shut it down, old school. One sentence, no messing, no prospect of elaboration. Woods has insisted that he would not enter a tournament unless he thought he had a chance of winning it. The 39-year-old looks towards the ground after hitting a shot during practice on Monday. Woods smiles as he talks with his traditional practice partner Mark O'Meara (left) at Augusta. ‘It would be my 15th major,’ said Woods. The temperature in the room dropped by several degrees. Brevity replaced levity. The questioner, gamely, tried again with a slight rephrase. ‘Long way to go before that,’ Woods replied. ‘Lot of work to do.’ He smiled. The chill passed. And, of course, that is exactly what it would be. Just his 15th major, if it signalled a true return to form. And on to the next one. World No 4 Jordan Spieth was in ninth grade — 14 years old — when Woods won his last major in 2008. But if he could win a fifth Masters he would be back in the game. And no more Mr Nice Guy, one feels. From 111th in the world, Woods has time to take the scenic route in conversation. Back to where he was, back to contending, he would be all business again. Not entirely like before, of course, because he could never go back to before — but not many of the guys who are genuinely fancied to be wearing the green jacket on Sunday night practised as Woods did, with partner and kids in tow. Woods gets a hug from his children,  Charlie and Sam, who will carry his bag for the par three tournament. Woods' girlfriend Lindsey Vonn leads the pair around the course to watch their father practice. Ski champion Vonn has a chat with tournament favourite Rory McIlroy during practice. As Woods putted, Lindsey Vonn, a world champion skier, clutched Charlie and Sam and chatted to a passing Rory McIlroy. The contrast was clear. McIlroy, whose easy manner and charisma require no effort, is not here to smell the azaleas. He is the world’s best golfer, on the brink of a third consecutive major in what would be a personal Grand Slam — only the sixth in the world to do it. He has a lot at stake. Woods is on bonus time. In January, he shot an 82, 11-over-par, at the Waste Management Phoenix Open, his worst round in close to 13 years. A week later, he walked off at Torrey Pines after 11 holes citing back problems. His partner that day, Chris DiMarco, thought it was more out of embarrassment. ‘He wasn’t doing anything good,’ he said. Woods then took an indefinite break from golf, with claims he had the chipping yips. On Monday he admitted being stuck between two release patterns, which amounts to the same thing. When he spoke of his journey to this point of return, it was clear he regards it as the second — maybe third, considering the events of 2009 — phase of his career. Woods shot the worst round of his professional career, an 82 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open. Woods speaks to the world's media after withdrawing from the first round of the Farmers Insurance Open. The 14 major winner stands at the tee as the Augusta course is mowed ahead of this year's tournament. ‘People would never understand how much work I put in to come back and do this again,’ he said. ‘I worked my ass off, that’s the easiest way to describe it. I worked hard. Sun up to sun down. When the kids were in school, I’d be doing it. When they went to sleep, still doing it. ‘The way I saw it, if I started when the sun came up I’d be a better player when it set. Getting better incrementally. It would come in flashes. It would come for 10 minutes and then I’d lose it for an hour. Then I’d get it back. Gradually, it flipped. I’d have it for an hour, lose it for 10 minutes. And then it was just there. There were some frustrating moments, but I had to stick with it. There were times when clubs flew, when a few suddenly slipped out of my hand — and travelled some good distances. ‘But we kept working, shot by shot, hour by hour. It was slow and steady, just taking little bits of progression. I had to hammer it out, make sure it was engrained. I just had to get through it.’ Woods smiles after winning his last major in a play-off with Rocco Mediate at the 2008 US Open. The all conquering American celebrates winning the Masters after sinking a play-off putt in 2005. Nick Faldo slips the green jacket on Woods after he won his first major at the 1997 Masters. And now he’s through it. And America waits. For while nobody expects the player one better than Hennie Otto of South Africa to beat among the most competitive Masters fields in the modern era, that doesn’t mean there is not a desperate yearning for the impossible to happen. It doesn’t help that the man in Woods’s place is not Bubba Watson, or Rickie Fowler, or any of the other star spangled pretenders, but a 25-year-old from Belfast who plays for the wrong team when the Ryder Cup is on. America likes Rory, but it loves Tiger. His victories once caused a spike in Wall Street’s Monday morning figures, and golf’s television numbers have not recovered from his spell in recovery. So the positive lines in Woods’s Masters preparation are lapped up and thrown out as a potential feelgood hit of the summer. That’s why Woods is still, against all logic, asked about winning here. Why he plays the game, and talks about winning right back at them. ‘I prepare to win and expect to go and do that,’ he said. ‘I’ve come close in the last 10 years. Half of the tournaments since 2005 I had a chance on the back nine. I just didn’t get it done. For whatever reason, I didn’t seize the opportunity.’ The former champion has spoken of practicing his game from dawn until dusk to hone his swing. Woods latest comeback has sparked a tidal wave of interest from American supporters and beyond. The room seemed pleased with the answer. Woods was asked what, at 39, remained his greatest motivation. ‘Winning,’ deadpanned old Tiger, suddenly solemn. And then he smiled. ‘I like it,’ he said, before disappearing through a side door. Tiger Woods is the 111th best golfer in the world and entirely at ease with that. For now.

Article: (CNN)The terrorist group Al-Shabaab has claimed an attack on Garissa University College in eastern Kenya, in which many people have been killed and still more taken hostage. The attack is another step in the ongoing escalation of the terrorist group's activities, and a clear indicator that the security situation in East Africa is deteriorating fast. Somalia-based Al-Shabaab has been behind a string of recent attacks in Kenya, the most well-known of them being the massacre at the Westgate Shopping Centre in Nairobi in 2013. Cross-border raids into Kenya by the group, however, date back to 2011. Al-Shabaab incursions triggered a military response by the government in Nairobi, which sent troops to Somalia as part of an African Union mission in support of Somalia's internationally recognized government that had been under pressure from Al-Shabaab and other militants for several years. Al-Shabaab is predominantly driven by the same radical interpretation of the Koran as al-Qaeda and ISIS (also known as Islamic State), but also employs more opportunistic approaches to shoring up local support. Its origins lie in Al-Ittihad al-Islami (Unity of Islam), one of several militant factions that emerged in the wake of the fall of Siad Barre in 1991. These disparate groups fought each other and a U.N. peacekeeping mission in the Somali civil war that led to the complete collapse of the country, from which it has yet to recover almost quarter of a century later. Al-Shabaab (literally "the Youth") split from Unity of Islam in 2003 and merged with another radical Islamist group, the so-called Islamic Courts Union. As their alliance obtained control of Somalia's capital Mogadishu in 2006, Ethiopia, the only majority Christian country in the region, took military action against the group. The offensive weakened Al-Shabaab and pushed it back into the rural areas of central and southern Somalia, but it failed to defeat it. To the contrary, Ethiopia's invasion and occupation of parts of Somalia -- although invited by the Somali government and backed by the African Union -- enabled Al-Shabaab to partially re-invent itself as both an Islamist and nationalist force opposing a foreign "Christian" invasion. Initially, the group primarily attacked Ethiopian forces, but soon began to "expand" its activities against the Somali government as well. The first attack outside Somalia was an attack in the Ugandan capital of Kampala in 2010. Soon after this, cross-border raids in Kenya began, predominantly targeting Christians there. Increasing its links with al-Qaeda, Al-Shabaab declared its full allegiance in 2012 -- and it is not clear whether it will switch allegiances to ISIS. Much will depend on how the relationships between al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), a long-time ally of Al-Shabaab based in Yemen, and ISIS develop. The key point is that Al-Shabaab's attack in Garissa is part of a broader regional context of instability fueled by a huge number of factors. It must not be interpreted simply as another act of garden-variety fundamentalist terrorism. Clearly, the presence and activities of terrorist groups in the region is a major concern, and it is undoubtedly driven by radical and exclusivist interpretations of Islam. But the entire region also suffers from a range of other problems: from economic development challenges to environmental degradation; from organized crime to inter-tribal and inter-communal violence; from corruption to serious deficits in human rights and good governance. These entrenched inequalities help Al-Shabaab appeal to a wide variety of potential recruits, who may sympathize with and actively support the group for any number of reasons. Attacking a university in northern Kenya and separating Christian from Muslim students epitomizes the way Al-Shabaab advances itself by exploiting religious, tribal and nationalist identities. Ultimately, though, this all comes down to a struggle for control -- over people, over territory, and over resources. As long as the majority of people in the region remain excluded from any meaningful political, economic, and social participation in their societies -- which are dominated by primarily self-interested elites that put their own advance before that of their communities -- human lives matter little in the pursuit of selfish interests. It is important to counter Al-Shabaab directly, including by military means. But there won't be any lasting solution to the wider region's security problems without a more comprehensive and concerted effort to address the deeper problems of exclusion suffered by the citizens of the countries challenged by Al-Shabaab. As Garissa shows, these problems are still providing oxygen for nihilistic ideologies and their deadly fruit. Copyright 2015 The Conversation. Some rights reserved.

Article: At the grand old age of 75, Jack Nicklaus is still capable of hitting aces. The Golden Bear added another magic moment to his storied career at Augusta National in the Par-3 Contest. Stepping up to the tee on the 130-yard fourth, the greatest golfer of all time saw his shot sail beyond the flag before spinning back into the hole. Jack Nicklaus gave the crowd something to cheer with a hole in one on the fourth during the Par-3 Contest. Nicklaus holds up his ball to an adoring crowd as Gary Player (left) and Ben Crenshaw salute the great. Crenshaw and Nicklaus fist pump following his ace on the 130-yard hole at Augusta National. Nicklaus was playing alongside Gary Player and Ben Crenshaw  as the first roar of Masters week filled the skies in a sunswept Georgia. 'I had an interview this morning, and I said "well, all I've got to do is go out and win the Par-3 and make a hole and one", and I make a hole in one,' Nicklaus said afterwards. The ace was Nicklaus' first on the hallowed turf of Augusta, but the veteran saw his achievement eclipsed by that of Camilo Villegas on a day which saw five hole-in-ones, levelling the record from 2002. The Colombian followed Nicklaus with an ace on the fourth and also managed one on the eighth, but he couldn't quite land the title, losing out to world No 74 Kevin Streelman in a play-off. Nicklaus became the youngest person to wear a green jacket in 1963, and collected his sixth in 1986. He is one of five men to complete the career grand slam, an accolade which favourite Rory McIlroy can achieve if he wins his third major in succession.

Article: (CNN)Easter is a cornerstone event in the Christian faith, but it's surrounded by interesting quirks. It celebrates the completion of Christ's mission of salvation in the Crucifixion and Resurrection. By dying on Good Friday, Christ atoned for the sins of others; by rising from the grave on Sunday, Christ conquered death. Simple enough and reason for Christians to celebrate. But, like Christmas with its tree, ornaments and Santa Claus, Easter has picked up its peripheral trappings -- the bunny and colorful eggs.  Unlike Christmas, it doesn't fall on the same day every year but shifts around in spring depending upon cosmic events. And that blood moon we just had -- is it pure coincidence that it fell around Easter? (No.) Here's a journey from the Vatican to the Holy Land, around the moon and the Earth's tilting axis, to Germany and the United States to try to explain the complex holiday called Easter. And you'll learn to how to color Easter eggs with Kool-Aid. Let's start at the Vatican. At the Vatican, Holy Week began with Palm Sunday last week and culminated in Easter Sunday Mass with multiple celebrations in between to mark the final week of Christ's mortal life. Jesus rode on the back of a donkey into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday where crowds celebrated him as the Messiah and laid down palm branches in his path. But the crowd and the Romans turned on him in the course of the week, according to the Bible, leading to his crucifixion and resurrection. Rain sprinkled down on worshipers standing under a sea of umbrellas as they gathered in a gray St. Peter's Square on Sunday to partake in the outdoor services held by Pope Francis. Afterward, the Pontiff took a moment to tell the world to do right those in need in his Urbi et Orbi address. Francis lamented the suffering of people in many of the conflicts around the globe. From Nigeria to South Sudan, Iraq to Ukraine, he expressed hope that violence would end. Francis also doesn't put on airs. This week he washed the feet of believers, repeating the Biblical account of a woman, a sinner, washing Jesus' feet and anointing them with oil. Let's move on to old Jerusalem, the birthplace of Easter. The Church of the Holy Sepulcher in old Jerusalem unifies the spot where Christ was crucified -- Calvary -- with his tomb, or sepulcher. On Sunday, Catholics and Armenian Christians celebrated the Resurrection there. In the morning, the Latin Patriarch, the Archbishop of Jerusalem, entered the basilica. Then mass was held followed by a procession. But a large group of indigenous Christians didn't join them. It's not quite Easter yet in the Holy Land for Eastern Orthodox Christians. They'll be celebrating a week from now, because they determine Easter's date by a different calendar than Western Christians -- the Julian calendar. Which brings us to the question of how astronomy is used to determine the date of Easter Sunday. A blood moon appeared in the sky early Saturday, right between Good Friday and Easter Sunday and during Passover. Just a coincidence? Not completely, because the dates for both Passover -- the Jewish holiday celebrating the deliverance from slavery in Egypt -- and Easter are determined by moon phases, according to timeanddate.com. Easter's timing is related to Passover, because Jesus was crucified around then, according to the Bible. Many Jewish holidays, including Passover, fall on full moon, which is also a prerequisite for a lunar eclipse, the event that turns the moon a blood red color. Since the timing of moon phases doesn't jibe with Earth's orbit -- which is how we determine the length of a year now -- Passover's exact date moves around -- and so does Easter's. When Christian bishops first convened at the Council of Nicaea in the year 325, they made a rule to determine the date of Easter, so as to fairly reliably pin it to Passover:. It would fall on the first Sunday after the first full moon following the vernal equinox. That's the day in March when Earth's axis reaches a midpoint between winter and summer and the day and night are of equal length. But... if the full moon fell on Sunday, Easter would be pushed down a week. Confusing? It got worse. When the West moved from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar, Orthodox Christians stayed put, resulting in -- usually -- two separate dates for Easter. In 1997, the World Council of Churches pushed for a unified method of determining a date based on astronomical occurrences. It didn't catch on. But some odd Easter trappings that popped up after the Middle Ages very much have -- the eggs and the bunny. The bunny is an egg-laying pagan that worships the moon. That's one notion of its origins, but probably not the actual one. German immigrants appear to have brought it to North America in the 1700s. German historians are not clear on its beginnings, but the first known mention of the bunny and the eggs in writing was in 1682. Professor of medicine Georg Franck von Frankenau described in his paper "De ovis paschalibus," or "On Easter eggs," a custom in the Alsace region involving a bunny and eggs, according to German public television. Some also credit the region with inadvertently inventing the Christmas tree. But von Frankenau left out any explanation of how the tradition arose, leading to a number of theories in Germany. One common idea: During Lent, people had to abstain from eating eggs, but hens kept on laying them, so farmers boiled and preserved them. By the time Easter rolled around, they were practically swimming in them. They had to figure out something to do with them when the holiday hit. Play hide and seek with them; color them; give them as gifts. Parents may have invented the bunny as a playful explanation for children on where the Easter eggs came from. If you're coloring eggs this year, here's an interesting tip.  Instead of stinking up your place with the smell of vinegar, use Kool-Aid, YouTube science geek Grant Thompson suggests. And it appears to work. Just use a whole packet in a small glass of hot water and gently lay the eggs in. They turn out as bright as they would in any other food dye. But be careful, it stains everything else, like clothes and upholstery, Thompson warns. That's why your tongue changes colors when you drink it. Happy Easter! Happy Passover!

Article: Manchester City's youngsters finished off a job well done against Leicester City, adding to their 3-0 first-leg lead with two late goals from Isaac Buckley and Brandon Barker at the King Power Stadium. Layton Ndukwu had given Leicester hope of clawing back the advantage with 20 minutes to go but substitute Buckley and Barker struck to kill that dream off and set up a final against Chelsea later this month. City will face Chelsea at a venue, likely to to be the City Football Academy Stadium, in the first leg on April 20 before travelling to Stamford Bridge a week later on April 27. Manchester City's Isaac Buckley Ricketts (left) celebrates scoring at the King Power Stadium on Wednesday. Manchester City's players celebrate after they consolidated their first leg lead to reach the Youth Cup final. Leicester City: Smith-Varnham, Miles, Chilwell (c), Choudhury, Kipre, Johnson, Bailey (Barnes 62), Fox, King, Rowe (Muskwe 72), Ndukwu. Unused subs: Knight, Bramley, Dombrauskis,. Bookings: Choudhury. Manchester City: Haug, Maffeo, Humphreys, Oliver, Angelino, Bryan (c) (Bullock 92), Nemane, Wood (Buckley 46), Celina, Garcia, Barker. Unused subs: Albinson, Fernandes, Dilrosun. Bookings: Wood, Bryan, Angelino. With City holding a big advantage from the first leg last month, this clash always looked difficult for Leicester, and their inability to find an early goal made the task of overhauling the advantage even tougher. City were the better team for much of the first half but goalkeeper Kjetil Haug had to be aware to keep out Hamza Choudhury from close range at the other end. That was their best chance until Charlie Oliver handled inside his own penalty area with 20 minutes to go to gift Ndukwu the chance to give the home side the lead. That opportunity was one he gratefully accepted, confidently dispatching his spot-kick past Haug. Layton Ndukwu of Leicester City scores from a penalty to cut the deficit but it was not Leicester's night. Brandon Barker (right) scored City's second goal of the evening as they made it to a first final in seven years. Despite still holding a decent lead, City surged forward in response and Buckley equalised, thumping home Barker's cross. And Buckley effectively returned the favour when he was hauled down inside the area moments later to allow Barker to make it 5-1 on aggregate from the spot. City march on and face Chelsea in a rematch of their last final in this competition seven years ago. The Premier League champions' youth side won 4-2 on aggregate on that occasion and will be hoping for a repeat this year.

Article: (CNN)After years of making the case that the education of athletes is paramount, the NCAA now says it has no legal responsibility to make sure education is actually delivered. On its website, the NCAA prominently states, "It's our commitment -- and our responsibility -- to give young people opportunities to learn, play and succeed." And later, it says that "in the collegiate model of sports, the young men and women competing on the field or court are students first, athletes second." But the NCAA is taking a very different position in response to a lawsuit filed by former University of North Carolina athletes. The lawsuit claimed the students didn't get an education because they were caught up in the largest known academic fraud scandal in NCAA history. In its response, the NCAA says it has no legal responsibility "to ensure the academic integrity of the courses offered to student-athletes at its member institutions." Even with pages of online information about academic standards, and even though the NCAA has established a system of academic eligibility and accountability that it boasts of regularly, NCAA attorneys wrote in this court filing that "the NCAA did not assume a duty to ensure the quality of the education of student-athletes," and "the NCAA does not have 'direct, day-to-day, operational control' " over member institutions like UNC. "It's nonsense. It's double talk," said Gerald Gurney, a former athletic-academic director who is now president of The Drake Group for academic integrity in collegiate sport. "If you look at their basic core principles, it's all about academics, the experience, the integration of academics, and the education of the student is paramount," Gurney said. "They seem to talk out of both sides of their mouths." The NCAA referred calls for comment to an online statement, which read in part:. The NCAA believes that the lawsuit misunderstands the NCAA's role with respect to its member schools and ignores the myriad steps the NCAA has taken to assist student-athletes in being equipped to excel both in the classroom and on the playing field. "This case is troubling for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that the law does not and has never required the NCAA to ensure that every student-athlete is actually taking full advantage of the academic and athletic opportunities provided to them," said Donald Remy, NCAA chief legal officer. In its response to the lawsuit, it also likened its role to that of the American Bar Association or American Medical Association, and said that those entities are not sued every time a lawyer or doctor acts inappropriately. The scandal at UNC involved thousands of athletes who, over 18 years, were funneled into classes that never met, where advisers fudged grades and accepted plagiarism so that athletes who were falling behind in class could remain eligible to play sports. Mary Willingham, the UNC whistleblower turned NCAA critic, has for years said that athletes across the country are accepted to colleges even though they're academically underprepared and then pushed into classes where little work is required. The system of eligibility that the NCAA brags about, she says, is a sham. "Why do we go through the trouble of compliance if we can't legitimize that the courses are real and the education is real anyway? It makes no sense," said Willingham, who recently wrote a book about the UNC scandal called "Cheated." "If they can't legitimize that the academics are real and take no responsibility for that, then why certify students semester after semester to play? It's lost its meaning for me." The NCAA's claim that it's hands-off when it comes to athletics seems to be a direct contradiction of what the organization has been repeating for years, not just in the rhetoric on its website, but in speeches by its president, Mark Emmert, and in court defending itself from numerous lawsuits over paying athletes. For example, before it lost a case filed by former UCLA player Ed O'Bannon, suing for the right of athletes to make money off their images and likenesses, the NCAA stood on the pillar of amateurism, insisting that college athletes are paid with an education. That's the defense the NCAA is now using in another class action filed by big-time sports attorney Jeffrey Kessler, seeking to make college sports a free market where athletes are paid salaries based on their value. In response, the NCAA said that what sets college sports apart from pros is education: Consistent with "its commitment to amateurism, member institutions conduct their athletics programs for students who choose to participate in intercollegiate athletics as a part of their educational experience and in accordance with NCAA bylaws." Attorney Michael Hausfeld, who represented both O'Bannon and now the UNC athletes, said this:. "This startling inconsistency is unfortunately all too symptomatic of the NCAA's shifting rhetoric and faltering commitment to its college athletes. NCAA President Mark Emmert has repeatedly proposed that 'What we live for is the education of our athletes,' but the NCAA's record tells a far different story." But Rick Burton, professor of sport management at Syracuse University, said it's not realistic to think that the NCAA would regulate every professor and every course an athlete might take at each university across the country. "I understand, I think, where the NCAA is coming from. We would not let the NCAA come in and tell us how to run our chemistry department at Syracuse University," he said. "It sounds like someone is trying to say the NCAA should have been supervising that department at the University of North Carolina, and there's no logic to that," he said. "The people who are saying the NCAA should be held accountable for academics at every school are just looking for an opportunity to throw rocks at the NCAA." UNC, which was also sued, has admitted to the fraud, but also asked for a judge to throw out the case, saying the athletes waited too long -- seven years -- to sue and the "educational malpractice" theory doesn't apply. UNC claims it is protected by state law. This is reminiscent of another NCAA reversal. The NCAA, which was founded a century ago to protect athletes from "dangerous and exploitive athletic practices," now says it does not enforce health and safety rules. In fact, in response to a lawsuit filed by the family of a player who died in 2011, the NCAA wrote: "The NCAA denies that it has a legal duty to protect student-athletes." A CNN investigation found that the NCAA has failed to open investigations in several cases where safety rules allegedly were broken. It has also fallen behind in imposing rules for concussions -- far behind even the NFL. Ramogi Huma, president of the National College Players Association, and a leading thorn in the NCAA's side for decades, said this latest backpedaling from the NCAA leaves him wondering why the organization exists at all. "There's nothing left the NCAA can claim it does that is beneficial to college athletes or society. One has to wonder what does the NCAA do if it doesn't protect players? If it doesn't play a role in the education of college athletics? It begs the question of why does the NCAA exist -- and why does it have a tax exemption."

Article: Daniel Ricciardo has called for a back-to-basics approach for Red Bull to forge a return to the front of the grid. Second best to Mercedes last season after a run of four successive championship triumphs, Red Bull have struggled at the start of this year. To rub salt into the wounds, Red Bull even found themselves trailing'sister' team Toro Rosso at the last race in Malaysia. Daniel Ricciardo in action during practice for this weekend's Chinese Grand Prix. The Australian driver has urged his Red Bull team to go back to basics after a troubled start to 2015. The main gripe has centred on power-unit supplier Renault, with billionaire benefactor Dietrich Mateschitz suggesting this week he could pull his team out of the sport if matters fail to improve. Ahead of this weekend's grand prix in China, Ricciardo concedes Red Bull are exploring numerous avenues to correct the problems. The Australian managed to finish third quickest in practice, a second behind reigning champion Lewis Hamilton in his Mercedes and four tenths of a second adrift of Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen. 1. Lewis Hamilton Mercedes 1:37.219. 2. Kimi Raikkonen Ferrari 1:37.662. 3. Daniel Ricciardo Red Bull - Renault 1:38.311. 4. Sebastian Vettel Ferrari 1:38.339. 5. Nico Rosberg Mercedes 1:38.399. 6.

'We are experimenting with a few things, but I think for now we have to go back to what we know, get our basics right,' said Ricciardo. 'We have done quite a bit. In Malaysia we had brake issues, a lot of overheating, so we have reverted back on a few things, even from last year which we knew was more efficient. 'Just because it's from last year it doesn't mean it's not better, so I guess we have taken a step back in that direction. The team has done quite a lot to rectify some issues and get us further up the grid.' Ricciardo has no doubt Renault are also pulling their weight, adding: 'From Melbourne to Malaysia they made a pretty massive step with driveability. 'We also have a few more software things this weekend, which should give things another pretty significant step on that side. 'I appreciate what everyone is doing to get us back towards the front, so fingers crossed it can be put together in the right way this weekend and if so we can get back into that top five.' Daniil Kvyat was forced to pull off track 19 minutes from the end of FP2 after his brakes caught fire. Team-mate Daniil Kvyat, however, was not so fortunate as the young Russian was forced to pull off track 19 minutes from the end of FP2 after his brakes caught fire. Christian Horner said: 'Something overheated within the rear hub assembly. As a result of that we lost pressure in the master cylinder halfway round the lap. 'We asked him to drive back slowly without using the brakes if at all possible, but unfortunately he had to brake at turn 14 and he had a very slow off. 'It's frustrating it's happened, but all the relevant pieces are intact so we can find out what the root cause was.' Despite suffering brake issues in Malaysia, Horner insists the issue there and the one experienced by Kvyat are 'totally unrelated'. Horner added: 'Today was a one-off and can be sorted for tomorrow.'

Red Bull have endured a difficult start to the new Formula One campaign. Daniel Ricciardo was third quickest during practice for the Chinese GP. The Australian's Red Bull team-mate Daniil Kvyat was sixth fastest. But his brakes caught fire and he was forced to stop on track.

Article: (CNN)A Connecticut teen who has been forced to have chemotherapy to treat Hodgkin lymphoma will remain in temporary custody of the state for the time being, according to her attorney, Josh Michtom. A Connecticut juvenile court judge issued a written decision Wednesday denying a motion to let the teen, identified in court documents as "Cassandra C.," go home. The judge also denied a motion for visitation. The 17-year-old is in remission after nearly six months of forced chemo treatments. On March 16, Michtom tried to convince the court that she should be able to return to her mother's home because she was no longer at imminent risk of harm from her illness. Michtom and attorney Michael Taylor, who represents Cassandra's mother, Jackie Fortin, released a written statement after receiving the judge's decision Wednesday: "We are disappointed in this ruling, not least of all because it draws a factual conclusion that is directly contradicted by the weight of the evidence. We're conferring with our clients now about next steps, including whether to take another appeal." Cassandra was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma in September and medical experts gave her an 85% chance of survival if treated with chemotherapy. Without it, doctors said at the time, she was likely to die within two years. She started chemotherapy in November but ran away after two days, according to court documents, when she decided she did not want to put the poison of the treatment into her body. In December, a judge ordered the young woman to be under the custody of the Connecticut Department of Children and Families. At that time, she was admitted to Connecticut Children's Medical Center in Hartford and has remained there since then.  Doctors surgically implanted a port in Cassandra's chest to administer chemotherapy medications, which began in spite of legal maneuvers to halt them. Cassandra is feeling well and is in good shape as far as her health is concerned, according to Michtom. "She's seen in her case the side effects weren't bad, and she's been well-treated by the nurses and doctors and does want to complete the treatment," he said. Her treatment is scheduled to wrap up this month. Michtom and Taylor failed in their effort before the Connecticut Supreme Court to make the case that Cassandra was mature enough to make her own medical decisions. Joette Katz, the commissioner of the Department of Children and Families, told CNN in March the agency is "very pleased with Cassandra's progress toward a complete recovery. We understand how difficult this has been for Cassandra and her family, but we have had full confidence throughout that the medical professionals involved in her treatment would be successful in saving her life." The agency has denied CNN's request to speak with Cassandra or her physicians. According to Michtom, the Department of Children and Families could have withdrawn its position for an order of custody but hasn't. He said the department sees Cassandra as a flight risk because she has run away before. Representatives for the department have said in court and in conversations with Michtom and Taylor that they will withdraw their pending neglect petition once Cassandra completes her last round of chemo -- expected around the end of April -- and that she'll be allowed to return home. So for now, Cassandra is said to spend her days reading, watching TV and drawing. "The hospital is effectively jail," Michtom said.

Article: Michael Vaughan, who is favourite to become England’s cricket supremo, was quick to condemn the openers after West Indies got them both out early on. With Jonathan Trott out without scoring in the first over and captain Alastair Cook failing again Vaughan said: ‘Their footwork and their mindset has been about looking to survive rather than getting on top.’ Geoff Boycott was also critical of the pair, saying: ‘Opening batsmen are supposed to face the new ball when it’s doing a little bit. If you can’t play that, you’re in the wrong job.’ Michael Vaughan criticised the footwork and mindset of England's top order for just looking to survive. Jonathan Trott was out for a duck on his return to the Test match side in Antigua. Alastair Cook was clean bowled by Kemar Roach for 11 as England struggled on the first morning. Former fast bowler Bob Willis said: ‘England’s top three looked constipated and need a good dose of syrup of figs.’ West Indies’ early success after putting England into bat appeared at that stage to make a mockery of the comment by Colin Graves, the new England and Wales Cricket Board chairman, who labelled the opposition ‘mediocre’.

England's top order collapsed on the first morning in Antigua. Jonathan Trott, Alastair Cook and Gary Ballance all out cheaply. Michael Vaughan critical of footwork and mindset of the trio. Vaughan is favourite to take up role of England cricket director.

Article: (CNN)Mark Ronson's "Uptown Funk!," featuring Bruno Mars, is the longest-leading Billboard Hot 100 of the 2010s, ruling the chart for a 13th week. It's also just the 10th single in the Hot 100's entire history to spend at least 13 weeks at No. 1. Plus, newcomer Natalie La Rose reaches the top 10 with her debut hit "Somebody," featuring Jeremih. As we do each Wednesday, let's run down all the songs in the top 10, and a bit beyond, on the sales/airplay/streaming-based Hot 100 (dated April 11). "Funk," released on RCA Records, passes Robin Thicke's "Blurred Lines," featuring T.I. and Pharrell to take sole possession of the Hot 100's longest command this decade. Here's an updated look at the hits to lead for the most weeks since the beginning of 2010:. Weeks at No. 1, Title, Artist, Date Reached No. 1. 13 (to date), "Uptown Funk!," Ronson feat. Mars, Jan. 17, 2015. 12, "Blurred Lines," Robin Thicke feat. T.I. + Pharrell, June 22, 2013. 10, "Happy," Pharrell Williams, March 8, 2014. 10, "We Found Love," Rihanna feat. Calvin Harris, Nov. 12, 2011. "Funk" also becomes one of an elite 10 singles ever to top the Hot 100 for at least 13 weeks, dating to the chart's Aug. 4, 1958 launch:. Weeks at No. 1, Title, Artist, Date Reached No. 1. 16, "One Sweet Day," Mariah Carey & Boyz II Men, Dec. 2, 1995. 14, "I Gotta Feeling," The Black Eyed Peas, July 11, 2009. 14, "We Belong Together," Mariah Carey, June 4, 2005. 14, "Candle in the Wind 1997"/"Something About the Way You Look Tonight," Elton John, Oct. 11, 1997. 14, "Macarena (Bayside Boys Mix)," Los Del Rio, Aug. 3, 1996. 14, "I'll Make Love to You," Boyz II Men, Aug. 27, 1994. 14, "I Will Always Love You," Whitney Houston, Nov. 28, 1992. 13 (to date), "Uptown Funk!," Ronson feat. Mars, Jan. 17, 2015. 13, "The Boy Is Mine," Brandy & Monica, June 6, 1998. 13, "End of the Road," Boyz II Men, Aug. 15, 1992. Ask Billboard: Will 'Uptown Funk!' be the Hot 100's No. 1 Song of 2015? With "Funk" now just three weeks from potentially tying "One Sweet Day" for the record, and four weeks from possibly claiming it all to itself, can it rewrite Hot 100 history? It's too early to forecast charts a month away, but "Funk" still sports strong leads in all main Hot 100 metrics. "Funk" logs a 13th week atop the Digital Songs chart with 165,000 downloads sold (down 12 percent) in the week ending March 29, according to Nielsen Music.  That's a record-tying feat: "Funk!" matches Flo Rida's 2007-08 hit "Low," featuring T-Pain, for the most weeks a title has spent at No. 1 on Digital Songs. "Funk" also leads Streaming Songs (16.2 million U.S. streams, down 15 percent) for an 11th week. On Radio Songs, "Funk" reigns for a 10th week with 166 million in all-format audience (down 4 percent). It's the first song to reach double-digit weeks at No. 1 on Radio Songs since "Blurred Lines" led for 11. Ask Billboard: Will 'Uptown Funk!' Be the Hot 100's No. 1 Song of 2015? "Funk," thus, leads the Hot 100 and its three main component charts (Digital Songs, Radio Songs and Streaming Songs) simultaneously for a record-extending ninth week (nonconsecutively). Perhaps helping the chances that "Funk" can remain at No. 1 on the Hot 100, at least for another week: while it's down by 11 percent in overall activity, the No. 2 song (for a third week), Maroon 5's "Sugar," decreases by 3 percent, while Ed Sheeran's "Thinking Out Loud," at No. 3 (for a third week, after peaking at No. 2 for eight weeks), is off by 2 percent. And, the lead of "Funk" over those songs is still significant: they each boast approximately two-thirds of the Hot 100 points of "Funk" this week. Could either "Sugar" or "Loud" rebound to challenge "Funk" further on the Hot 100? Could another song in the top 10 topple it? Or, is it a song just building, or not even yet released, that will take over? Again, it's too soon to tell. We know only that a song will eventually dethrone the uncommonly overarching smash that "Funk" has become. (At least we think one will...) Chart Highlights: Taylor Swift's 'Style' hits No. 1 on adult pop songs. Meanwhile, "Sugar" takes over at No. 1 on the subscription services-based On-Demand Songs chart, despite a 10 percent drop to 4.1 million streams. ("Funk" falls to No. 3 on the list after 11 weeks at No. 1.) "Sugar" holds at No. 2 on Digital Songs (143,000, down 8 percent); rises 4-2 on Radio Songs (133 million, up 3 percent); and keeps at No. 4 on Streaming Songs (9.5 million, down 4 percent). Below Sheeran, Ellie Goulding's "Love Me Like You Do" holds at No. 4 on the Hot 100 after reaching No. 3. The Fifty Shades of Grey soundtrack single dips 3-4 on Digital Songs (114,000, down 14 percent) and stays at No. 5 on Radio Songs (118 million, up 8 percent) and Streaming Songs (9 million, up 9 percent). From the same hit movie, The Weeknd's "Earned It (Fifty Shades of Grey)" reaches the Hot 100's top five (6-5), adding top Airplay Gainer honors for a second week. On Radio Songs, it pushes 9-6 with a 23 percent gain to 86 million. "Earned" (a possible contender for No. 1 on the Hot 100...) holds at No. 6 on both Streaming Songs (8.9 million, up 24 percent) and Digital Songs (107,000, up 4 percent). The sultry track also takes over at No. 1 on Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Chart Highlights: Taylor Swift's 'Style' Hits No. 1 on Adult Pop Songs. Fetty Wap's "Trap Queen" rises 8-6 on the Hot 100, while spending a second week at No. 1 on Hot Rap Songs; Taylor Swift's "Style" ranks at No. 7 on the Hot 100 for a third week after reaching No. 6 (and, as previously reported, reaches No. 1 on the Adult Pop Songs airplay chart); Rihanna, Kanye West and Paul McCartney's "FourFiveSeconds" drops 5-8 on the Hot 100 after climbing to No. 4 (and departs the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs summit after seven weeks); and Flo Rida climbs 10-9 with "G.D.F.R.," featuring Sage the Gemini and Lookas. The rapper's new EP, My House, arrives Tuesday (April 7). One song is new to the Hot 100's top 10: La Rose's "Somebody," featuring Jeremih (13-10). The Dutch singer's debut hit lifts 10-8 on Radio Songs (73 million, up 9 percent); backtracks 13-14 on Digital Songs, but with a 7 percent gain to 68,000; and zooms 31-19 on Streaming Songs (4.3 million, up 5 percent). The track tops the Rhythmic Songs airplay chart for a second week. (Jeremih scores his fourth Hot 100 top 10, and first in a featured role.) La Rose is adjacent to her friend, and mentor, Flo Rida, on the Hot 100. After she had introduced herself to him at a party, they soon began working together, and she started touring with him. They created "Somebody," based on Whitney Houston's 1987 Hot 100 No. 1 "I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)," as La Rose is a "huge fan of '80s music," as she told Billboard. She's currently recording her debut EP. Just beyond the Hot 100's top 10, Walk the Moon's "Shut Up and Dance" pushes 15-12, and is the new No. 1 on the Hot Rock Songs chart, while Jason Derulo's "Want to Want Me" bounds 27-17. And, Rihanna roars in at No. 23 with "B**** Better Have My Money," the chart's highest debut, powered largely by its No. 5 debut on Digital Songs (108,000 sold since its digital retail arrival on March 26).

Article: Louis van Gaal believes Manchester United will hit the ground running in their attempt to win the Barclays Premier League next season after persuading the Old Trafford hierarchy to agree to a short and sharp pre-season tour of America in July. After last summer’s mammoth trek across the United States, an angry United manager Van Gaal vowed that it would never happen again on his watch and believes to this day that the effects of the pre-season schedule cost his side dearly when the real action started. Now Sportsmail can reveal that Van Gaal and United have turned down offers from Asia and Australia and are about to sign off a visit to America – in all likelihood to the west coast. The trip will last in the region of 12 days – a whole week shorter than last summer - and will be over by August 1. Manchester United beat Real Madrid in Michigan last summer in front of 109,000 fans. United played four games in America last pre-season, here Wayne Rooney scores against LA Galaxy. United beat Liverpool in the final to win the International Champions Cup last summer. While rivals such as Manchester City are trekking around Australia, Van Gaal and his United players will operate out of one base in America and travel to their games from there. The club have agreed once again to rake part in the International Champions Cup that they won last summer by beating Liverpool in a final in Miami. The tournament is played all over America but this time the promoters have essentially allowed United to choose their own venues as they are so desperate to have England’s most famous club in it. Details of the competition were supposed to be announced last week with United given a provisional deadline to commit to their schedule by last Friday. However, the announcement has been put on hold while Van Gaal and United tweak final details. Last season, Van Gaal joined United after the World Cup in Brazil to find the club committed to a two-and-half week marathon comprising visits to Los Angeles, Pasadena, Denver, Washington, Detroit and, finally, Miami. Rooney scored another spectacular goal for United against Aston Villa last weekend. Following their tour of America, United suffered a slow start but are now firing on all cylinders in the league. The Dutch veteran was furious at the itinerary that he felt asked too much of his players as they were constantly asked to fly in to different time zones and even play at altitude in Colorado. Having to then play the final in Florida during a thunderstorm was the final straw. For long periods of this winter’s negotiations, Van Gaal and United seemed set to commit to a schedule on America’s East Coast. It is understand, however, that Van Gaal has recently performed a volte face and expressed a preference for the more agreeable climates of the west. Van Gaal has insisted this time that his team will travel to match venues from one base and will have no repeat of the arduous treks endured to games in Pasadena and Ann Arbor last year. One possible base is the Seattle Seahawks training camp on America’s north-west coast. The Premier League season starts early this year, with the competition kicking off on August 8.

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence.
Manchester United will embark on a short tour of America this summer. They are likely to spend 12 days on the west coast, staying in one place. United will defend their International Champions Cup title. Louis van Gaal has avoided a lengthy, energy-sapping tour this year. CLICK HERE for all the latest Manchester United news.

Article: (CNN)A high temperature of 63.5 degrees Fahrenheit might sound like a pleasant day in early spring -- unless you're in Antarctica. The chilly continent recorded the temperature (15.5 degrees Celsius) on March 24, possibly the highest ever recorded on Antarctica, according to the Weather Underground. The temperature was recorded at Argentina's Esperanza Base on the northern tip of the Antarctica Peninsula, according to CNN affiliate WTNH. (Note to map lovers: The Argentine base is not geographically part of the South American continent.) The World Meteorological Organization, a specialized United Nations agency, is in the process of setting up an international ad-hoc committee of about 10 blue-ribbon climatologists and meteorologists to begin collecting relevant evidence, said Randy Cerveny, the agency's lead rapporteur of weather and climate extremes and Arizona State University professor of geographical sciences. The committee will examine the equipment used to measure the temperature, whether it was in good working order, whether the correct monitoring procedures were followed, whether the equipment was placed in the correct location and whether the measurement is matched by corresponding records from surrounding stations, Cerveny said. The committee will discuss the issues and make a recommendation to Cerveny, who will make an official finding, probably by late summer or early fall. Researchers who study climate change carefully watch weather changes in the Antarctic region and elsewhere for evidence that the Earth is getting warmer.

Article: Didier Drogba has revealed he will continue his playing career next season. The Ivorian made a shock return to Chelsea last summer after leaving the club in 2012, signing a 12 month deal. But the Blues legend's future remains unclear with the club still to offer him a new contract. Didier Drogba revealed he is not planning to retire at the end of the season - whether he is at Chelsea or not. The 37-year-old (left) is yet to be offered an extension on his current 12-month deal at Stamford Bridge. Drogba (left) celebrates the Blues last gasp victory against QPR at Loftus Road on Sunday afternoon. However, Drogba, 37, insists he has no intention to retire at the end of the season - whether he is at Chelsea or not. 'I have made a decision, it's not my last season,' said Drogba. The veteran striker has been forced to settle for a bit-part role at Stamford Bridge this season after the summer arrivals of Diego Costa and Loic Remy. And he admits he finds sitting on the bench frustrating, saying: 'It's difficult when you don't play and then have to go into these kind of games. But I try to give my best. 'I tried to give the best of my physical capacity against QPR, so if the manager needs me I'm ready.' Despite his lack of action, Drogba looks certain to pick up his fourth Premier League title this season. Veteran striker Drogba (centre) insisted he tried to give the best of his physical capacity against QPR. And the forward, who started Sunday's win at QPR, added: 'We are only looking forward. We just wanted to win at QPR to get closer to the title. 'We still have those games against Manchester United and Arsenal to play. But we try to only think about our game. 'We are top of the league. They are maybe thinking about us and hoping we make a bad result. But we are more positive that we want to win. 'You want to feel that it's comfortable at the top, but when you look at the game against QPR, you know the gap can be closed easily within a game or two. 'So you have to stay focussed and give everything like we did.'

Article: (CNN)The United States has seemingly erupted this week about what it means to live your religion, especially in Indiana, where its new Religious Freedom Restoration Act faces a firestorm from critics who say it uses faith as a pretext to discriminate against gay people. Such state laws have been growing ever since the U.S. Religious Freedom Restoration Act became law in 1993, designed to prohibit the federal government from "substantially burdening" a person's exercise of religion. So far, 20 states have some version of the religious liberty law, and the legal controversies have grown, too. Nonetheless, claims under those state RFRAs are "exceedingly rare," and victories involved mostly religious minorities, not Christian denominations, experts say. "There is reason to doubt whether these state-level religious liberty provisions truly provide meaningful protections for religious believers," wrote Wayne State University law professor Christopher Lund in a 2010 analysis, when there were only 16 states with such laws. Here are some of the more interesting cases arising from the federal and state laws, touching upon an array of religious matters from a knife carried by an IRS accountant to a tea from the Amazon:. He was a Native American with eagle feathers at a religious gathering of tribes. But not in the eyes of the feds. In 2006, Robert Soto and Michael Russell attended an American Indian powwow while in possession of eagle feathers, in violation of the federal Eagle Protection Act, which outlaws the killing of bald and golden eagles and even picking their feathers off the ground. Soto, a Lipan Apache, asserted he was participating in an Indian religious ceremony. The feathers are sacred to Native Americans. But a federal Fish and Wildlife Service agent found his tribe wasn't federally recognized, and Soto surrendered his feathers. Russell, who is married to Soto's sister, isn't American Indian and agreed to pay a fine, according to court papers and the America Bar Association Journal. Soto, however, petitioned the federal Interior Department to return his feathers. The feds said no, because he wasn't from a recognized tribe. Soto and Russell sued the federal government, but a federal district court ruled in favor of the government, rejecting the two men's First Amendment assertions and their claims under the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the same 1993 statute that Indiana legislators used in developing their new state law. But last August, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the trial court's decision and sent the case back to that court after finding the government's action would violate the federal RFRA. On March 10, the federal government returned the eagle feathers to Soto. But the legal war isn't over. The federal government still maintains it can criminally prosecute Soto and his congregants, so Soto is seeking a preliminary injunction, claiming the feds are violating the federal RFRA, said Luke Goodrich, Soto's attorney who's with the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty. A tea used by a Brazilian faith is to them like wine used by Catholics at communion, but U.S. agents considered the brew an illegal drug. The religious organization O Centro Espirita Beneficiente Uniao do Vegetal uses a sacramental tea called hoasca, made from two plants native to the Amazon that contains dimethyltryptamine, a hallucinogen, in violation of the Controlled Substances Act. The religion is a Christian spiritist faith that originated in Brazil and includes Amazonian and indigenous spiritual traditions. About 140 members of the church live in the United States and use the tea in a sacred communion. In May 1999, U.S. Customs agents entered the church headquarters in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and seized all of its hoasca. The church became alarmed and cited how the federal government allows an exception for American Indians to use another illegal drug, peyote, in their religious ceremonies. In fact, the federal RFRA was designed partly to protect the Native Americans' use of peyote, said CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. "They were a legitimate religion, and this was a legitimate ritual of the religion, and Congress wanted to make sure it was protected," Toobin said of peyote and the 1993 law. The Uniao do Vegetal, which means "the union of the plants," cited that federal law in suing the federal government. "The government has never explained why it has accommodated The Native American Church's use of peyote (which contains mescaline, also a controlled substance) but cannot accommodate the UDV's use of hoasca," the church said in a statement. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the church's favor, saying the federal government failed to show a compelling interest to ban the substance for religious use. "The peyote exception also fatally undermines the government's broader contention that the Controlled Substances Act establishes a closed regulatory system that admits of no exceptions under RFRA," the court ruling said. Bruce Rich, an Orthodox Jewish prisoner in Florida, wanted kosher meals, but the warden said no. So Rich sued the state prison system in 2010, saying its denial of a kosher menu violated the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000, a landmark civil law rights law for inmates whose predecessor was the federal religious freedom law. Rich, 66, is serving a life sentence for murdering his parents, in their 70s, in 1995 allegedly to inherit their home. The prison system argued the meals were costly and would lead to security concerns, namely "retaliation against the kosher inmates" if other inmates believed the higher costs of kosher meals impacted the quality of their food, court papers said. At least 35 other states and the federal government, however, provided kosher diets to inmates. After losing before a magistrate, Rich won an appeal before the 11th Circuit Court, which cited "the defendant's meager efforts to explain why Florida's prisons are so different from the penal institutions that now provide kosher meals such that the plans adopted by those other institutions would not work in Florida." Recently baptized in the Sikh faith, Kawal Tagore went to her job with the IRS in Houston in 2005 carrying a new religious item: a 9-inch kirpan, a small ceremonial sword that resembles a knife but has an edge that is blunted or curved. Tagore needed to carry the kirpan at all times as a mandatory article of faith. But the federal government banned her from the building, citing the kirpan as a "dangerous weapon" with a more than 3-inch blade, and she was later fired from her accounting job because she refused to keep the kirpan out of the workplace. Tagore sued the government under the federal law. Tagore cited how the government allowed the public to enter the federal building with more threatening objects: real 2.5-inch blade knives and metal canes, said her attorneys with the Newar Law Firm and the Becket Fund. Also, federal employees inside the building were allowed to use box cutters and cake knives. In November, the federal government agreed to settle the case shortly after the start of Tagore's trial. The settlement included no admission of wrongdoing, the Christian Science Monitor reported. Tagore's attorneys described the settlement as "a groundbreaking policy allowing Sikhs and other religious minorities to wear religious symbols and attire in federal buildings," they said in a statement. Invoking a religious freedom law and related statutes doesn't always equate to victory. In Chicago, an association of 40 churches called the Civil Liberties for Urban Believers found it too onerous to erect houses of worship in business and commercial zones. The ministers needed a special use permit, but such permits were often thwarted by aldermen or it was too bureaucratic and costly to obtain one, the church leaders claimed. In fact, it was easier to get a club, lodge or community center approved. So the pastors sued the city of Chicago in 2000, alleging that its zoning laws violated the Illinois religious freedom statute, the federal Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act and the U.S. Constitution. But in 2003, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court decision and rejected the church group's claims, finding no substantial burden on the churches, which also failed to establish their RLUIPA claim. Defeated, church leaders were angry. "The forty (40) churches in C.L.U.B. and certainly people of all faiths throughout Chicago are outraged by the majority opinion which neuters the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act passed unanimously by Congress in 2000," Apostle Theodore Wilkinson, the group's chairman, said in a statement. "Also alarming is the court's conclusion that Chicago's religious assemblies have no free speech protection from zoning laws. The majority opinion would apparently extend free speech protection to religious assemblies only if they allowed live nude dancing," he said. At the same time, the city of Chicago revised its zoning ordinance to avoid "the threat of heightened scrutiny under RLUIPA," according to a League of California Cities report in 2002. CNN's Alexandra Meeks contributed to this report.

Article: Gary Hooper came off the bench to snatch a dramatic stoppage-time winner to keep Norwich City on track for automatic promotion in the Sky Bet Championship after Neil Lennon's battling Bolton came within minutes of gaining a point. Former Celtic star Hooper's goal sparked jubilant scenes on the Canaries bench in contrast to the dejection of his one-time Parkhead boss Neil Lennon. Indeed, Hooper had been a transfer target for Lennon earlier in the season so his winning goal was a double blow for the Ulsterman. Gary Hooper celebrates after earning Norwich three points with a stoppage-time winner against Bolton. Former Celtic striker Hooper is mobbed by his team-mates as Norwich remained second in the Championship. Bolton: Bogdan, Vela, Dervite, Ream, Moxey, Bannan, Walker (Janko 87), Feeney, Gudjohnsen (Danns 82), Heskey, Le Fondre. Subs not used: Lonergan, M Davies, Trotter, Rochinha, McCarthy. Booked: Walker, Moxey. Scorer(s): Le Fondre. Norwich: Ruddy; Whittaker (R Bennett 71), Martin, Bassong, Olsson, Tettey, Howson, Dorrans, Hoolahan (Grabban 57), Redmond (Hooper 66), Jerome. Subs not used: Rudd, E Bennett, O'Neil, Odjidja-Ofoe. Booked: Bennett. Scorer(s): Dorrans 9, Hooper 90+. Referee: James Adcock. Graham Dorrans gave the Canaries an early lead as his right-footed free-kick deflected off Josh Vela into the net, but Adam Le Fondre looked to have rescued a point and extended Bolton's unbeaten run to four games. Instead, Hooper lobbed keeper Adam Bogdan - as the Wanderers defenders switched off - to score an invaluable goal. Lennon had promised his side would spoil a few parties in the remaining games of the season with Brantford and Bournemouth coming up in the next few weeks. That looked to be the case until Hooper's strike made it five wins in the last six meetings between the teams. Norwich made the perfect start with Dorrans' deflected free-kick after Vela took down Nathan Redmond on the edge of the area. The Canaries should have doubled their advantage six minutes later as Sebastien Bassong rose highest at a corner but cleared Bogdan's crossbar by some distance. Hooper lobs the ball over Adam Bogdan to spark jubilant scenes on the Canaries bench. Former West Brom midfielder Graham DOrrans celebrates after giving the visitors the lead on Saturday. And the visitors were in total control when Wanderers drew level totally against the run of play. It was so one-sided manager Lennon was poised to bring on Neil Danns to shore up his midfield. Instead, youngster Tom Walker, who had been guilty of delaying a cross moments earlier, learned his lesson. His flashing centre from the left picked out Le Fondre inside the six-yard box and the on-loan Cardiff City striker, back in the side after missing the Easter Monday trip to South Wales, finished with ease. Walker continued to prove a threat to the visitors' defence with his elusive running and was harshly booked for a foul on Wes Hoolahan. Liam Feeney shot narrowly wide from another Walker cross that fizzed beyond three static Norwich defenders before the Canaries rediscovered their composure. Top scorer Cameron Jerome, whose double won the reverse fixture at Carrow Road last October, brought a smart save out of Bogdan while the Hungarian international needed treatment after punching away another dangerous-looking Dorrans free-kick. Norwich striker Cameron Jerome heads towards goal during the clash at the Macron Stadium. The second half was much more competitive and Wanderers were more of a match for their high flying visitors. So much so that Neil brought on Lewis Grabban after 57 minutes for Hoolahan. And Grabban made an immediate impact, bringing out a save from Bogdan before Tim Ream cleared off the line from first-half scorer Dorrans. However, Bolton had their moments going forward too with Le Fondre trying cheekily to chip John Ruddy while Alex Tettey cleared off the line after Dorian Dervite narrowly failed to connect with Walker's corner. Neil's intention's were clear and with 20 minutes left had made his full set of substitutions with Hooper replacing Nathan Redmond and Steven Whittaker going off for Ryan Bennett. The visitors were incensed they did not get a penalty when Russell Martin's cross hit Dean Moxey on the hand. But any ill luck was cancelled out in injury time as hot shot Hooper slotted his winner.

Norwich beat Bolton 2-1 at the Macron Stadium in the Championship. Graham Dorrans gave the visitors the lead inside 10 minutes. Adam Le Fondre drew Neil Lennon's side level after 18. Gary Hooper won the game for Norwich in the closing moments. Norwich remain second ahead of Watford on goal difference.

Article: Atlanta (CNN)Robert Lewis Burns Jr., the original drummer in Southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd, died Friday night in a car crash, a Georgia State Patrol spokesman said. Burns, 64, died after his car hit a mailbox and a tree in Cartersville, spokesman James Tallent said. No other cars were involved in the crash, which occurred shortly before midnight. "He was not restrained at the time of the crash," Tallent told CNN. The musician lived in northern Georgia. Burns was part of the genre-defining band's original lineup, which formed in Jacksonville, Florida, in 1965. Lead singer Ronnie Van Zant started Noble Five with Burns, guitarists Gary Rossington and Allen Collins and bassist Larry Junstrom in their hometown. It then made a name change in a reference to a high school gym teacher. Lynyrd Skynyrd changed members over the years as it produced rock anthems including "Sweet Home Alabama" and "Freebird." Burns left the band before its third studio album, "Nuthin Fancy," in 1975, "exhausted by touring," according to the band's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame biography. He was not involved in the 1977 plane crash that killed three members, including Van Zant. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006. Lynyrd Skynyrd still tours with Rossington, the only original member still in the band. "Today I'm at a loss for words but I just remember Bob being a funny guy," Rossington said on the band's official Facebook page. "My heart goes out to his family and God bless him and them in this sad time. He was a great great drummer." People we've lost in 2015.

Article: Seoul, South Korea (CNN)The man accused of stabbing U.S. Ambassador Mark Lippert in Seoul last month is now charged with attempted murder, a South Korean court official said Wednesday. Kim Ki-Jong has also been charged with assaulting a foreign envoy and business obstruction, the Seoul Central District Court official said. According to South Korean law, Kim's trial must begin within 14 days of receiving today's indictment. Lippert was stabbed March 5 during an event organized by the Korean Council for Reconciliation and Cooperation, which advocates peaceful reunification between North and South Korea. Shortly before Lippert was supposed to give a speech, the attacker slashed him in the face and jaw. The ambassador suffered a gash from his right cheekbone to his lower jaw that required 80 stitches. That wound measured 10 centimeters (4 inches) long and 2.5 centimeters (1 inch) deep, but there was no serious facial nerve damage, said Dr. Jung Nam-shik of the Yonsei Severance Hospital. Lippert also suffered five cuts in his left arm and hand, but was not expected to have permanent damage to his arm function. Police said Kim stabbed Lippert with a 10-inch knife because he opposed the joint South Korean-U.S. military drills, which happen every year and frequently draw the ire of North Korea. Police official Yoon Myeong-seong told reporters that Kim had visited North Korea seven times between 1999 and 2007, and that authorities were investigating a possible connection between his visits to the reclusive state and the attack against Lippert. Kim, 55, has a history of unpredictable behavior. In 2010, he received a suspended two-year prison sentence for throwing a piece of concrete at a Japanese ambassador to South Korea, according to the Yonhap news agency. South Korean President Park Geun-hye condemned the attack. "This incident is not only a physical attack on the U.S. ambassador," she said, "but an attack on the South Korea-U.S. alliance and it can never be tolerated." CNN's Madison Park and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.

Article: (CNN)When Hong Kong police answered a call in the early hours of a Saturday morning last November, they encountered a grisly scene and an alleged crime that shocked the city. One woman was lying on the floor with cuts to her neck and buttocks. Another was stuffed inside a suitcase on the balcony. A former banker, 29-year-old Briton Rurik Jutting, was charged with two counts of murder. On Thursday, a court hearing that was to determine whether there was enough evidence to proceed to trial was adjourned until May. Here's what we know so far about the victims and their alleged attacker. Jutting allegedly lived at the murder scene, an upmarket apartment in the middle of Wan Chai, an inner-city suburb that's home to an eclectic mix of late-night bars, residential tower blocks and local markets selling groceries and assorted cheap goods. In the early hours of Saturday morning, November 1, police say Jutting called them to the apartment.  There they found a woman lying on the blood-splattered floor, later identified as 29-year-old Seneng Mujiasih. During a search of the apartment, officers uncovered another body hidden in a suitcase on the balcony. It's alleged 25-year-old Sumarti Ningsih was killed on October 27, five days before her body was found. Sumarti Ningsih was from Cilacap, in Central Java, and was the mother of a five-year-old girl. In a statement, her cousin, Jumiati, described her as  "just an ordinary woman from Indonesia" who, like many others, was "forced to work abroad to feed her poor family and make her dream comes (sic) true." "She wanted to work as professional so she can earn money and dignity for her family," Jumiati wrote. "She is good girl and did not deserve this treatment." According to the Asian Migrant Coordinating Body, Ningsih was visiting Hong Kong as a tourist and had been due to fly back to Jakarta the day after her body was found. Last year, her grieving father, Ahmad Khaliman, told Agence France-Presse that his daughter had worked in Hong Kong as a domestic helper between 2011 and 2013. She'd since returned on two occasions, Khaliman said. He said the family had been shocked by her murder, and called for the perpetrator to be executed. "If not, I cannot accept it. He has already taken my daughter's life, so he has to pay with his life," he told CNN affiliate Trans7. Seneng Mujiasih had more recently worked as a domestic worker in Hong Kong but had overstayed her visa, according to the Asian Migrant Co-ordinating Body. Also known as Jesse Lorena, Mujiasih was from the city of Muna in Sulawesi province, in southeast Indonesia. Other than that, few details are known about her life and why she stayed on in Hong Kong. After news of their death spread, fellow domestic workers held a vigil in Hong Kong's Victoria Park. Around 200 people gathered to sing and pray, and lay flowers besides photos of the two women. The victims' bodies were buried after being repatriated to Indonesia in November. Before being taken into custody, Rurik Jutting lived in the upmarket J Residence in Wan Chai.  He was detained at the scene, where police found the bodies of two women and seized a knife during a search of the premises. It's unclear when Jutting left his job as a trader at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch; a BoA spokesman would only confirm that a man of the same name had worked there in the past. Jutting's profile on LinkedIn said he haad been employed at the bank's structured equity finance and trading division in Hong Kong since July 2013. Before that, he worked in the same unit in London for three years. According to the profile, Jutting previously worked in capital markets for the British bank Barclays and studied history and law at the prestigious University of Cambridge, between 2004 and 2008. As part of the trial process, tests were conducted to determined if Jutting was psychologically fit to enter a plea. He was. The case was then adjourned to allow for more than 200 pieces of forensic and DNA evidence to be analyzed.

Article: Struggling Hamburg have appointed Bruno Labbadia as their new coach with immediate effect in a surprise decision with the former European champions anchored in last place with six matches left. Despite widespread speculation about a pending deal with former Mainz coach Thomas Tuchel, Hamburg said they had agreed on a 15-month contract with Labbadia, who had coached them in 2009-10. The coach's contract is also valid for the second division should Hamburg be relegated. He takes over from interim coach Peter Knaebel who replaced sacked Joe Zinnbauer in March and will now return to his post as sports director. Hamburg have appointed Bruno Labbadia as their new coach on a 15-month contract. 'We decided to take this step because we consider the coach question the most important,' said Hamburg CEO Dietmar Beiersdorfer in a statement. 'With Bruno Labbadia we now have a strong coach who is also experienced in relegation battles.' Beiersdorfer said the club had ended talks with Tuchel after an agreement could not be reached. Hamburg are the only club with a perfect Bundesliga record, having played every season in the top division since the league's creation in 1963. Labbadia returns to Hamburg for a second spell after coaching the club for one season in 2009-10. The 49-year-old Labbadia, a former Hamburg player, has also coached Bayer Leverkusen and VfB Stuttgart among other. 'We have no time to waste,' Labbadia said.

Article: Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers vowed not to give up on Champions League qualification after a convincing 2-0 win over Newcastle. The Reds moved within four points of the Barclays Premier League top four after goals from Raheem Sterling and Joe Allen saw off the struggling Magpies at Anfield. With fading champions Manchester City now looking vulnerable in fourth, Liverpool's hopes - which took a hefty blow in back-to-back losses to Manchester United and Arsenal - could have been reignited. Raheem Sterling wheels away in celebration after scoring Liverpool's opener. Rodgers said: 'The players and myself are very motivated to do the best we can. We have shown we can put results together consistently. We have important players coming back which is good news. 'But we are looking for other teams to slip up and we have to continue winning. 'There are teams above us but, as we have seen last year, there can be changes and points dropped and I think there will be changes.' Sterling curls the ball in to the far corner of Tim Krul's net to give Liverpool the lead. Liverpool, inspired by Philippe Coutinho, started superbly with Sterling scoring after nine minutes and several other chances being created. Newcastle rallied before the break and had a strong penalty appeal turned down but Allen made the game safe in the second half. Rodgers said: 'It was a good performance. I thought that our attacking play was very bright, we looked exciting going forward, we worked hard in the midfield. Sterling's shot nestles in to the back of the net as Krul picks himself up from Anfield turf. 'At times our possession could have been better but we had a real attacking intent and created chances and could have scored more goals.' The defeat was Newcastle's fifth in succession and left them with work still to do to ensure they do not get pulled into the relegation battle. Their misery was compounded when Moussa Sissoko was sent off for what was deemed a second yellow card offence, when he caught Lucas Leiva on the ankle. Manager John Carver admitted Sissoko could easily have been shown a straight red, however. Allen secured three points for Liverpool that narrowed the gap on Manchester City. He said: 'The sending off, it could have been a straight red, I will be honest. I have said that to Moussa, I am quite straight and I won't defend anyone if it is indefensible.' Asked if Sissoko could be fined, Carver said: 'I am sure there will be some kind of disciplinary procedure. I said before the game we needed to keep 11 players.' While Carver did not complain about that decision, he was angry that Ayoze Perez did not earn a penalty after apparently being felled by Dejan Lovren. He said: 'The game hinged on a huge decision. I don't want to be seen to be a moaner but it is fact we don't get big decisions for whatever reasons, it could be me. I have spoken to the referee, but it doesn't help me.' Lovren clears the ball with his head as Lucas and Perez also scrap for the ball. Carver did see reason for some optimism, feeling that his side's performance was much improved from their derby loss to Sunderland last time out. He said: 'I thought the first nine minutes we were very tentative, nervous after our performance against Sunderland. It was a bad goal to concede. 'After that we grew into the game. It is easy to crumble at Anfield but we didn't. One or two guys rolled their sleeves up. 'I think we got a response. We didn't get a result but I saw enough. 'There are lot of positives to take from the game. A lot of people expected us to get a hiding and I think we held our own for the majority of the game.'

Article: (CNN)Imprisoned soldier Chelsea Manning can now communicate with the world  -- in 140 characters or less. Manning, who is serving a 35-year prison sentence for leaking thousands of classified documents, appears to have joined Twitter this week. In a series of tweets, the prisoner formerly known as Bradley Manning said she will be using a voice phone to dictate her tweets to  communications firm Fitzgibbon Media, which will post them on her behalf. She is not allowed Internet access in prison, according to The Guardian. "It will be hard, but I don't want this Twitter feed to be a one-way street/conversation," Manning posted to her nearly 26,000-plus followers. Manning was sentenced in 2013, and in August of that year, she said she wanted to transition to a female. The Fort Leavenworth Disciplinary Barracks in Kansas, where she is serving her sentence, has authorized hormone therapy for her treatment. Manning said she suffers from gender dysphoria. Her  lawyers describe it as "the medical diagnosis given to individuals whose gender identity -- their innate sense of being male or female -- differs from the sex they were assigned at birth, causing clinically significant distress." Last year, a Kansas judge granted her request to be formally known as Chelsea Elizabeth Manning. The former Army intelligence analyst was convicted of stealing and disseminating 750,000 pages of documents and videos to WikiLeaks in what has been described as the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history. She was found guilty of 20 of the 22 charges, including violations of the U.S. Espionage Act. Manning has written opinion pieces for The New York Times and The Guardian from prison.

Article: American Airlines is tapping into the youth market with the introduction of their new in-flight music. New indie music was first piped into the cabin - during boarding and disembarking - a few months ago and has quickly become a hit with passengers. In fact, many have taken to Twitter to share their approval of the new on board playlists, which feature rockers such as The xx, Haim, Phantogram and Hozier. American Airlines is targeting a younger demographic with the introduction of their new 'indie' cabin playlists. According to BuzzFeed News, on an internal blog, American Airlines representative, Barbara Delollis, discussed the company's decision. 'For 2015, they sought out a style of music that's upbeat yet not distracting, helps American stand out from the competition and appeals to younger generations,' she wrote. And it takes a lot for a track to make the cut. According to Delollis, the songs aren't just those 'you might find on the iPad/Spotify of a Gen Xer or Millenial. Foster The People is just one of many indie rock bands that are included on American Airlines' new playlists. Tracks from Hozier (left) and Lykke Li (right) were also hand selected to be played on board the flights. While boarding and while disembarking, specially selected indie rock music will now be piped into the cabin. The change comes on the heels of unfavourable customer feedback about the airline's previous cabin music, which were instrumental piano versions of pop songs. Brian Richardson, senior manager of American's in-flight entertainment and connectivity, also shared his thoughts about the switch on the same internal blog. 'The instrumental versions of pop songs had become tired and people were ready for a change,' he added. One Twitter user was especially excited to hear one of her favourite bands, Phantogram, on board. Washed Out, or Ernest Greene, is an electronica singer-songwriter and record producer from Georgia. Hozier's Take Me to Church was one of the biggest songs of the year - and can now be heard on board. Phantogram (left) and The xx (right) are two of the featured artists on American Airlines new cabin playlists. One customer mused that boarding his American Airlines flight felt like heading into a trendy nightclub. For this Twitter user, the best part of his flight was the boarding music playlist - and arriving safely, of course. Some passengers aren't totally excited about the change, like this man, who liked the previous elevator music. He also shared his excitement about seeing customers on board take out their smartphones and use the Shazam app to identify the songs playing. 'Who would've thought that we'd be introducing some people to these indie artists?' he wrote. The indie music is paired with the airline's new state-of-the-art cabins and, so far, all mainline and some regional aircraft have adopted the in-flight playlists. MailOnline Travel has contacted American Airlines for comment.

Article: (CNN)President Barack Obama tied himself to the mast of a nuclear deal with Iran even before he became the Democratic candidate for president. Reaching a good, solid agreement with Iran is a worthy, desirable goal. But the process has unfolded under the destructive influence of political considerations, weakening America's hand and strengthening Iran. Obama's political standing and his historic legacy in foreign policy are so deeply intertwined with reaching an accord with Iran that if the deal ultimately collapses, he may fear that historians will conclude that his legacy in global affairs collapsed with it. There is a reason one gets the feeling that it is the United States and not Iran that is the more eager, even desperate, side in these talks, even though Iran is the country whose economy was sent into a deep chill by international sanctions; the country whose only significant export, oil, lost more than half of its value in recent months. The reason is that Obama has a huge political stake in these negotiations. The President may insist that the United States will choose no deal over a bad deal, but few people truly believe he has a credible Plan B. Few believe it, particularly in the Middle East and notably among America's Arab friends, who hold the view that Iran is running circles around the United States and outplayed Obama. As the writer David Rothkopf aptly put it, "Iran is having a great Obama administration." That's a belief that has already started shaking up the region. Saudi Arabia has said that it will pursue nuclear weapons if it believes Iran has not been stopped, and there is little doubt that other countries among Iran's Muslim rivals will do the same. In fact, the notion that Obama is not handling the Iranian threat effectively is contributing to a new war in Yemen, where Saudi Arabia and other Arabs are trying to push back against gains by Iran's allies. We can trace it all back to the Democratic primaries in 2007, when then-Sen. Obama said he would meet Iran's leaders "without preconditions," leading his rival, Hillary Clinton, to call the idea "Irresponsible and frankly naive." As the years of his presidency unfolded, and the Middle East started coming apart, finding a deal with Iran started to look like the one major foreign policy achievement Obama might leave behind. The political imperative started to intrude in strategic considerations on an issue that is of transcendent importance to world peace. The framework agreement announced on Thursday came two days after Obama's March 31 deadline. The U.S.-imposed deadline served only to pressure the United States, and the French ambassador very publicly decried as a "bad tactic." That bad tactic was a political move, a push to produce some sort of result, however vague, to protect the talks from critics. Again, a solid agreement that ensures Iran will not produce nuclear weapons would be a most welcome development. But the agreement so far does not look promising. It certainly shows the final outcome will differ greatly from what Obama had vowed. In a presidential debate in 2012, Obama described a crystal clear goal for negotiations. "The deal we'll accept is they end their nuclear program. It's very straightforward." Nobody is talking about Iran ending its nuclear program. Not even close. Iran will be allowed to keep one-third of its more than 6,000 centrifuges. That's not a small symbolic number. And it does not appear as though any of its nuclear facilities will be dismantled, although Fordow will contain no nuclear materials. Iran has insisted all along that its nuclear program has only civilian uses. The fact is that Iran has a well-established record of lying and concealing the elements of its nuclear program to U.N. inspectors. And the U.N. agency chief says that has not stopped. A couple of weeks ago, with days left until the negotiating deadline, U.N. nuclear chief Yukiya Amano said Iran is still stonewalling. "We are still not in a position to conclude that all nuclear material in Iran is [for a] peaceful purpose," he warned. The negotiations' starting point is that Iran would like to have the bomb and the international community wants to delay that as much as possible -- and preferably, forever. The world only learned about Iran's secret facilities at Arak and Natanz after dissidents raised the alarm. Iran, we have learned repeatedly, is very good at lying to international inspectors. It is well-established that it has had something to hide about its nuclear program. It is well-established that many of Iran's neighbors don't trust it and are anxious about the U.S.-led international dealings with Iran. It is well-established that Iran has engaged in international terrorism and in destabilizing the region. It is also clear that it took harsh international sanctions and a collapse in oil prices to bring Iran to the negotiating table. It was Iran that had the most to lose from a failure of talks. But political considerations turned the United States into the supplicant. The framework agreement starts lifting those indispensable sanctions much too soon. Nuclear enrichment will continue, although at a lower level. Iran officially, legally, becomes a nuclear threshold state, with the capability to make the final dash to a bomb within a "breakout" period of one year, the time when presumably inspectors would discover violation and allow the rest of the world to act. Even the Fordow facility, conveniently inside a fortified bunker in a mountain, will remain in existence, though "converted" to a nuclear "research facility" And without nuclear material on site. International sanctions lifting will begin almost immediately. Its nuclear infrastructure will remain largely in place, even if operating at a reduced pace, giving Iran much of what it wanted. With Iranian forces gaining ground in Arab lands and Iranian commanders declaring the destruction of Israel "nonnegotiable" and threatening Saudi Arabia, this deal does not look reassuring. Obama is right that a diplomatic solution is the most desirable option. But the deal so far looks like (another) win for Iran. It introduces enough restrictions that it could give the President the political cover he wants, but it does not do enough to make the world safe from nuclear proliferation and more potentially catastrophic instability in the Middle East.

President Obama is eager to reach a nuclear deal with Iran, but the process has been influenced by political considerations, weakening America's hand and strengthening Iran's, with the current framework agreement appearing to favor Iran and potentially leading to a nuclear arms

Article: Given the inexorable march of the past 12 months in one direction, perhaps it is only appropriate that Rory McIlroy should spend the eve of the Masters on Wednesday with a member of the celebrated boy band of that name. But it is not lookalike Harry Styles who will carry the Northern Irishman's bag in the par-three tournament but keen golfer Niall Horan as McIlroy looks for a little light relief before his first attempt to complete a career Grand Slam. One Direction released their debut album in 2011, the same year McIlroy won his first major, so you could say they have mirrored each other, hit for greatest hit. Rory McIlroy watches a tee shot during a practice round prior to the start of the 2015 Masters Tournament. McIlroy alongside his caddie Caroline Wozniacki during the 2014 Par 3 Contest  in Augusta. McIlroy celebrates with his  Wozniacki on the 9th hole during  the Par 3 contest at Augusta National Golf Club. At last year's Masters, McIlroy piqued the interest of one or two photographers when then fiancee Caroline Wozniacki donned the caddie's famous white boiler suit. He might find the curiosity levels are even greater this time, for One Direction are even more popular in the US than in Britain. Between them, Niall, an honorary member at Mullingar, Westmeath, and Rory might do more to stir up interest in golf among the young than any number of 'old fogey' initiatives. 'We met in Australia at the end of last year and he was saying he had never been to The Masters,' said McIlroy. 'I said if you're available on the Wednesday you're more than welcome to carry the bag. Niall's really excited.' Niall Horan will swap girls screams for Augusta greens as he caddies for golfer McIlroy. McIlroy hits a putt in the rain during a practice round prior to the start of the 2015 Masters Tournament. McIlroy looked more subdued than excited at his press conference yesterday, possibly because he knew what was coming. On the one hand, he feels as ready as he ever will for his tilt at history. On the other, he had to spend 30 minutes with journalists wanting to trawl over his poor record at Augusta. Here is a sample: Why is your record so bad on the par fives, Rory? Why have you never birdied either the first or the 10th holes? Why have you left here for the past five years with at least one 77 on your score card? What the hell's wrong given all the advantages offered by your length off the tee? McIlroy  walks over the Nelson Bridge with caddie J.P. Fitzgerald during a practice round. To be fair, he answered them all with politeness. After all, there was nothing there he had not analysed and dissected countless times himself. McIlroy knows better than anyone he has no chance unless he does better on the long holes. He brought up the point raised in the Sportsmail graphic from last Saturday, which compared his record on the par fives last year with that of winner Bubba Watson. 'Just look at the two par fives on the back nine on Sunday,' he said. 'I had a nine iron in my hand for my second shot on both and I walked off with two sixes. Two fours I'd have finished third. McIlroy waits under an umbrella during a practice round prior to the start of the 2015 Masters Tournament. 'It's something I've been thinking about a lot. Look at Bubba, who played them in eight-under for the week to my level par and beat me by eight shots. 'I've just been too aggressive at times. I had four sixes on par-fives last year, so if I can clean up those, I'll have a chance to win.' As for those 77s, he said: 'It's not like I'm having a bad 18 holes. It's always just a bad nine holes that causes the damage and it's usually on a Friday, like last year. But I am better equipped now to handle it if things don't go right way. Mentally, I'm in a far better place.' McIlroy conceded that the circus surrounding Tiger Woods's return had not been unhelpful and the draw has worked out pretty well, too. The place you do not want to be come Thursday is in one of the last two groups, like Woods, but McIlroy has been treated kindly, with a mid-morning threesome alongside Americans Phil Mickelson and Ryan Moore. 'I don't think I've played alongside Phil at Augusta so that's perfect,' he said. 'We always get along well and he has a great record here. It will be fun to watch him.' It was this time last week, while practising in Florida, that McIlroy pronounced himself ready to go. 'It's been great not to have to think of anything technical while I'm playing,' he said. 'I've been able to enjoy the build-up.' Rory McIlroy waits with his caddie Fitzgerald in the rain during a practice round  at Augusta National Golf Club. Asked who he saw as favourite, McIlroy went for Bubba — ironic given a recent ESPN survey among the pros ranked Watson as the least favourite. 'I take it as I need to improve as a man,' said Watson, with the sort of annoying comment that explains his unpopularity in the first place. As for McIlroy, he knows where he needs to improve. 'You look at this course and it should fit me perfectly from tee to green,' he said. After One Direction on Wednesday, it'll be his turn to generate some roars.

Article: (CNN)Universal's "Furious 7" continues to build momentum at the Friday box office for a weekend debut in the $135 million-$138 million range, the largest opening in North America since fall 2013. That includes a projected Friday take of $58 million-$60 million. The final film featuring the late Paul Walker, "Furious 7" is opening around the globe this weekend and earned a record-breaking $60 million internationally on Wednesday and Thursday for a possible worldwide debut approaching or crossing $300 million by the end of Easter Sunday. "Furious 7" is getting the widest release in Universal's history. Domestically, it will be playing in 4,003 theaters by Good Friday. Internationally, it has booked more than 10,500 screens in 63 territories, although it won't open in China, Japan and Russia until later. The current record-holder for top April opening domestically is "Captain America: The Winter Soldier," which debuted to $95 million from 3,928 theaters last year. "Furious 7" is likewise poised to nab the biggest opening of 2015 to date. And it will easily beat the $121.9 million launch of "The Hunger Games Mockingjay — Part 1" in November 2104, making it the largest three-day opening since "The Hunger Games: Catching Fire" ($158 million) in November 2013. The movie enjoys massive awareness and interest, due to both the popularity of the street-racing series and Walker's death. The last film, "Fast & Furious 6," debuted to a franchise-best $117 million over the four-day Memorial Day weekend in 2012, including $97.4 million for the three days, on its way to grossing $788.7 million worldwide. Universal intended to open "Furious 7" on July 11, 2014, but production was halted in November 2013 when Walker died in a car crash during the Thanksgiving hiatus. After director James Wan, writer Chris Morgan and Universal pored over existing footage and tweaked the script, production resumed in April 2014. CGI and voice effects were used in some scenes featuring Walker's detective character, Brian O'Conner, with Walker's brothers, Caleb and Cody, used as stand-ins. "Furious 7" pits Vin Diesel's Dominic Toretto and crew (which includes Michelle Rodriguez and Tyrese Gibson, among others, as well as Walker) against Jason Statham's Deckard Shaw, out for revenge after the death of his brother. Dwayne Johnson also reprises his role as Hobbs. ©2015 The Hollywood Reporter. All rights reserved.

Article: Andy Murray arrived back in Britain on Monday restored as world No 3 in the new rankings — but set aside thoughts of that to focus on his wedding in Dunblane this weekend. And despite his recent tournament finishes getting him back near the top of the game, the 27-year-old Scot confirmed it will be a down-to-earth guest list when he marries fiancée Kim Sears in his hometown on Saturday. There are believed to be well over 100 people attending, but star spotters will find celebrities in short supply as the couple focus on celebrating with family and genuine friends. Andy Murray celebrates winning a point in the second set against Novak Djokovic  in the mens final. Novak Djokovic  plays a backhand against Murray  in the mens final during the Miami Open. Murray plays a forehand against Djokovic  in the final during the Miami Open  at Crandon Park Tennis Center. ‘There’ll be no celebrities as such, I don’t have any celebrity friends so it wasn’t something that was planned,’ said Murray, before he flew back after his Miami Open final defeat to runaway world No 1 Novak Djokovic on Sunday. The one possible exception is comedian James Corden, although he is busy working in America. There will be quite a few friends prominent in British tennis — aside from anything Kim’s father Nigel has been one of the country’s leading coaches — but with the Monte Carlo Open beginning next Monday the bigger international names were always going to be otherwise engaged. Murray and Djokovic pose for a photograph prior to the mens final during the Miami Open. Djokovic holds the winners trophy after defeating Murray in the final of the Miami Open. In fact the only non-British player likely to attend is Jean-Julien Rojer, a doubles specialist from the Dutch Antilles who has a base in Miami. ‘Jules lives there and I spend quite a lot of time with him. Tim (Henman) will be coming. James Ward, Jamie Delgado (longstanding British player and coach). ‘We invited Kyle Edmund but he can’t make it because he’s playing,’ said Murray, who confirmed the couple will not cash in on photography rights to any magazines. Other tennis guests include coach Amelie Mauresmo, former assistant coach Dani Vallverdu and two of his three best men, brother Jamie and former Davis Cup player Ross Hutchins. The third is Carlos Mier, a friend from his days at the Barcelona tennis academy he attended. Kim Sears fiancee of Murray  watches him in action against Djokovic in the fierce Miami sun. ‘Everyone who we’re close to, people we’ve spent a lot of time with in the past and people that we see ourselves spending time with in the future. That’s how we came up with the list,’ said Murray. Rather than asking for wedding gifts, the couple have requested that guests make a donation to charities they support such as UNICEF and the World Wildlife Fund. ‘I’m going to go up to Scotland early and spend time with my family for a couple of days. I’m not going to hit any balls this week. Pretty much everything is done now and under control. I’m sure a few things will come up. World No 3 Murray is set to marry his fiancee Sears in Dunblane next Saturday. ‘Kim has pretty much controlled most of the important things and I’ve tried to help when she’s asked. I haven’t been overly involved but there’s things I enjoy doing, I did all the food and cake tasting which I actually loved.’ There will not be any honeymoon until later in the year. In the middle of next week Murray will head to Barcelona to train with incoming assistant coach, former Swedish player Jonas Bjorkman, before resuming his tournament schedule the week after that in Munich. Another change in the new rankings on Monday was Spaniard Rafael Nadal moving down to No 5.

Article: (CNN)Deion Sanders is such a dad. The NFL legend called out Deion Sanders Jr. on Twitter for saying he only eats "hood doughnuts." In response, the elder Sanders -- in front of his 912,000 followers -- reminded his son he has a trust fund, a condo and his own clothing line called "Well Off." "You're a Huxtable with a million $ trust fund. Stop the hood stuff!" Sanders followed it up with another tweet that included the hashtags #versacesheets #Huxtable and #Trustfund. Junior is a wide receiver at Southern Methodist University, an aspiring entrepreneur and occasional rapper. His Twitter timeline is a mix of biblical verses, motivational quotes and references to sports, cars, school and Balenciaga shoes. He also has gone on record with his love for "hood doughnuts," or confections from "a place in the hood," saying "if my doughnuts don't come in a plain white box, I don't want them!" His father promptly put him in his place. Sanders Jr. seemed to take the public browbeating in stride, retweeting his father's comments. At least he knew better than to delete them.

Article: (CNN)According to an outside review by Columbia Journalism School professors, "(a)n institutional failure at Rolling Stone resulted in a deeply flawed article about a purported gang rape at the University of Virginia." The Columbia team concluded that "The failure encompassed reporting, editing, editorial supervision and fact-checking." Hardly a ringing endorsement of the editorial process at the publication. The magazine's managing editor, Will Dana, wrote, "We would like to apologize to our readers and to all of those who were damaged by our story and the ensuing fallout, including members of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity and UVA administrators and students." Brian Stelter: Fraternity to 'pursue all available legal action' The next question is:. Can UVA, Phi Kappa Psi or any of the other fraternities on campus sue for defamation? The Virginia Supreme Court said in Jordan v. Kollman that "the elements of libel are (1) publication of (2) an actionable statement with (3) the requisite intent." "Actionable" means the statement must be both false and defamatory. Of course, the law of defamation must be balanced against the freedom of speech protected under not only the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, but also the Virginia Constitution. True statements cannot be defamatory. Neither can pure statements of opinion, because they theoretically cannot be either true or false. But the Rolling Stone article certainly purported to be fact, and it apparently is not exactly what the law considers "true." The individual members of the fraternity will likely be considered private individuals, and not public figures; the latter have a harder time proving defamation. A private person suing for defamation must establish that the defendant has published a false factual statement that is about the person and that it also harms the person's reputation. The private plaintiff also must show that the defendant knew that the statement was false, or believed it was true but lacked a reasonable basis, or acted negligently in checking the facts. At first blush, that sounds like it fits perfectly, right? The Columbia report may go a long way toward establishing at least a modicum of the required intent. But that's only half the battle. There are strict rules about who can be a plaintiff in a defamation action like this. The identity of the aspiring plaintiff matters. First, let's eliminate UVA. The university is a public university, and therefore it is a governmental entity. The Supreme Court has been clear on the issue of libelous statements about the government: The government cannot sue for defamation. There is no such cause of action in American jurisprudence. Now the fraternities, starting with Phi Kappa Psi. A fraternity is not an individual, but a group. A plaintiff in a defamation case must show that the statements were "of or concerning" the plaintiff. It sounds obvious, but if you're going to say a statement hurt you, you have to prove the statement actually was about you to begin with. When the statements are about a group without naming an individual, it's hard to say the statement is "concerning" the individual -- and groups generally cannot sue.  For example, you can be sued if you call a specific lawyer a thief, but that same person cannot sue you if you simply call all lawyers thieves. Defamatory statements about a group are therefore not actionable by the group's individual members, for the most part. Like all rules, however, there are exceptions. If the defamatory language is about "a comparatively small group of persons and the defamatory part is easily imputed against all members of the small group, an individual member may sue." If I said, "The 1980 Philadelphia Phillies infielders were a bunch of criminals" (they weren't),  the individual players could sue, because that mean statement is clearly about certain persons -- if I said that -- which I didn't. Phi Kappa Psi would likely argue that the "small group" exception fits it perfectly: Even if the individual members were not identified by name, the defamatory story has been imputed directly to individual members, who have suffered by their association with the group. On the other hand, Rolling Stone's lawyers would likely argue that the group is so large and fluid (after all, the membership changes somewhat every year), that even though the fraternity's reputation is tarnished, the members have suffered no individualized injury. As for the other fraternities on campus but not implicated in the story, that's likely a group that moves from the small category to large, and the members of Greek life generally will have a harder time bringing a lawsuit. Lawyers will tell you that a libel suit is one of those things that citizens often threaten each other with on Facebook, but that such cases are rarely actually filed. That's because a plaintiff usually has to show some kind of financial harm. So if your Aunt Edna calls you a loser on Twitter, you're going to have to spend money on an expert to explain to a jury how that actually damaged you financially. And since most of the people who waste time threatening each other with defamation suits  on Facebook live in their moms' basements and are "between jobs," these are not the kind of people who have money or reputation to damage in the first place. The UVA situation is not your run-of-the-mill defamation case. The university won't be able to sue, but if the members of the fraternity can get past some of the preliminary hurdles of a defamation claim, and they can make a tangible case for damages, then this could be one of those rare successful defamation cases.

The Columbia Journalism School found that Rolling Stone's article about a gang rape at the University of Virginia was flawed, and the magazine apologized to its readers and those damaged by the story, but the fraternity and individual members may have a hard

Article: Arsenal have been here before. Manchester City sniffing around with their millions, looking to prize away some of Arsene Wenger's finest talent. Jack Wilshere is the latest man linked with a switch to the Etihad Stadium, where he would follow the likes of Emmanuel Adebayor, Bacary Sagna and Samir Nasri who swapped London for the North-West as City stormed towards Premier League and FA Cup glory. But times have changed. The Gunners are now ahead of City in the table and appear to be a club on the up, while the men from Manchester must rebuild. And if £30million or more is truly on the table for Wilshere, Arsenal must consider it. Manchester CIty are considering making a move for Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere this summer. Wilshere hasn't played for the first team since injuring his ankle against Manchester United in November. Alexis Sanchez cost Arsenal £30m, while Chelsea splashed out roughly the same amount to bring in Diego Costa. Those two forwards have a combined total of 33 league goals this season. And for all Wilshere's many talents, he would not be a game changer for Manuel Pellegrini, or whoever City's manager may be next season. He was touted as a future Arsenal and England midfielder when he burst onto the scene, showing the world what he can do in a Champions League tie against Barcelona, and possesses a technical ability which wouldn't see him out of place at the Nou Camp. His quick movement, superb touch and low centre of gravity is perfect for the sharp, driving style of play manager Wenger likes at the Emirates Stadium, as Wilshere's goal of the season against Norwich last season perfectly demonstrated. He has been doubted on several occasions, partly because of his lifestyle off the pitch, in the most part because of his treacherous injury record at the age of 23. The midfielder has picked up a total of 24 knocks during his seven-year professional career. He was tipped as a future Arsenal star and England international when he broke through the ranks in 2008. Wilshere is only 23 years old but has picked up 24 separate injuries during his professional career. But even as recently as this season, Wilshere was hitting form before going off against Manchester United. He was certainly more impressive than Aaron Ramsey and Santi Cazorla in the Arsenal midfield, and impressed for England in a deep-lying role. There now seems to be little space for the Stevenage-born schemer to fit in this starting XI. Ramsey, Cazorla, Sanchez, Francis Coquelin, and Mesut Ozil played behind Olivier Giroud in the recent thumping victory over Liverpool, and that's without the likes of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Tomas Rosicky, Theo Walcott and Danny Welbeck involved. Of course, the ideal state of play would be for Wenger to build a team around Wilshere, a man who is signed on for three more years, and not to consider any bids from divisional rivals at least. But Arsenal would be foolish to dismiss anything over £30m in today's market, especially considering the kind of players Wenger can now attract to the club. Wilshere impressed in a holding role for England in an international friendly against Scotland last year. He was in form before ankle surgery, scoring a fine goal against Manchester City in September. The midfielder fired past Brad Guzan to score the opening goal against Aston Villa last season. Wilshere's effort against Norwich was voted the 2013-14 Premier League Goal of the Season. Arsenal's relationship with City, who the club have never held a firm rivalry with, could also play a part. Any interest from fellow top-four clubs Chelsea or Manchester United would probably be dismissed immediately. The current Premier League champions are looking to rebuild under Sheik Mansour and need homegrown, young players to freshen up an ageing side. Wilshere is seen as a possibility along with Jordan Henderson in midfield. Raheem Sterling and Paul Pogba have also been linked with a summer transfer, with Nasri and Yaya Toure among many names who could leave. But with Liverpool set to hand Henderson the captain's armband after Steven Gerrard's departure, his stay would seem more likely despite his contract running down at Anfield. Arsenal fans would hate to see Wilshere go and he encapsulates the style at the Emirates. However, for a man who has scored five goals in his league career, and one who would not neccessarily push on close rivals to better things, it may be worth thinking about. Jordan Henderson is also a possibility for Manchester City as the club look for homegrown youngsters.

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence.
Manchester City considering bid for Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere. Jordan Henderson is also an option for the Premier League champions. Wilshere, 23, encapsulates Arsene Wenger's style of play in north London. But the England international is not necessarily a first-team regular. Any bids in excess of £30m should be considered by Arsenal.

Article: (CNN)One of Tokyo's most prominent districts has taken a small, but potentially significant step to recognizing same-sex unions in Japan. The government of Shibuya ward, one of the capital's most famous shopping and trendy entertainment districts, passed ordinance on Wednesday paving the way for "partnership certificates" for same-sex couples, allowing them some of the rights of married heterosexual couples. Same-sex partners who are registered with the district's ward office will be able to hold visitation rights in hospitals and co-sign tenancy agreements. Other advantages that heterosexual married couples enjoy, such as joint filing of taxes, are controlled by the federal government and are outside the remit of individual municipalities. The measure was proposed in February by Shibuya's mayor, Toshitake Kuwahara. While the certificates will not be issued until later in the summer and are not legally binding, proponents of marriage equality in socially conservative Japan say that the ward's decision is a step in the right direction. "It is not a marriage license and advantages will be limited but still better than nothing," Gon Matsunaka, a gay rights activist, told CNN. While Shibuya's decision does not yet equate to heterosexual marriage, the hope is that the move will be the beginnings of promoting marriage equality for gay communities. "What is important for the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) community in Shibuya is the ruling will make us visible in society,"  Matsunaka said. "It could be a strong driver for Shibuya citizens to learn and know what kind of problems LGBT people are facing." Taiga Ishikawa, Tokyo councillor and the first male gay local assembly member in Japan, told CNN the ordinance was a "big first step for the protection of human rights." He called the decision "happy" but said that it must go alongside education about alternative lifestyles. He said that the most important part of today's announcement is that it "should be actually put into practice, as should education for understanding (LGBT individuals) especially they suffer as they find out their sexuality when they are young." Neighboring Setagaya ward has indicated that it would look into following Shibuya's lead. However, former councilor Ishikawa cautioned against taking the movement's momentum for granted. "To realize equal rights for gay couples, a national law has to be made," he said. While outright discrimination against the LGBT community is rare in Japan, its effects can be hidden and gay people often find themselves at a disadvantage. Many hide their sexuality from their employers, co-workers, families and friends. But the tide may be turning. A recent poll found that a slight majority at 52.4% oppose gay marriage, but support amongst young adults in their 20s and 30s is as high as 70%. An editorial in the Asahi Shimbun newspaper, which commissioned the poll, welcomed the Shibuya decision, calling it "a bold and important step forward." Only traditional marriages are recognized under Japan's constitution, but the wording is vague enough to open it to interpretation, according to Mari Miura, a professor of gender and politics at Sophia University in Tokyo. "The constitution does not rule out same-sex marriage, so an interpretation can be made that it is constitutional," Miura told Bloomberg Business. While Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party "don't like the idea of same-sex marriage, but at the same time the issue is gaining momentum." Conservative groups were vocal in their opposition, with one, known as the Network Pushing for Normalization of Education, telling the Japan Times that granting same-sex couples the same rights as all other Japanese citizens would degrade the "familial system and practice that heterosexual unions have long preserved in human history." While Shibuya's registration system will be a first for Japan, Yodogawa ward in the western Japanese city of Osaka was the first in the nation to recognize and support the LGBT community.

Article: Sunday's trip to Loftus Road marks Chelsea’s 700th game under the ownership of Roman Abramovich, a period Jose Mourinho says has been positive not only for the club but for English football as a whole. Some would quibble with the second part of that statement, but Mourinho says that too will change. If the first 699 games under Russian rule has established Chelsea at the top of English and European football, Mourinho believes the next 700 will see them supply more players for the English national team as they implement Abramovich’s demand to follow Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules. Sunday's trip to Loftus Road marks Chelsea’s 700th game under the ownership of Roman Abramovich. Abramovich (right) celebrates with Frank Lampard (centre) and John Terry after Chelsea clinch their first Premier League title under his ownership in 2005. The Russian finally got his hands on the Champions League trophy following Chelsea's success in 2012. Mourinho also believes Chelsea’s adherence to FFP — ‘compared with other clubs and owners who didn’t want to play under the rules’, he pointed out in a thinly veiled dig at Manchester City — positions them as standard bearers for the English game. There can certainly be no doubt Chelsea are in a far stronger position than when Abramovich bought the club from Ken Bates for £140m on June 1, 2003. In the intervening 12 years he has spent in the region of £842.9m on transfer fees, winning three Premier Leagues, four FA Cups, three League Cups, one Europa League and one Champions League, but now, Mourinho says, Abramovich’s rule will benefit England as well as Chelsea. Jose Mourinho, seen here with Abramovich in 2004, has has been in charge of Chelsea for almost five of the Russian's 12 seasons at Stamford Bridge. The Blues have won three Premier Leagues, four FA Cups, three League Cups, one Europa League and one Champions League since 2004. ‘He has been good for Chelsea, good for English football, good for European football,’ said Mourinho, who has been in charge for almost five of those 12 seasons. ‘Chelsea after him became strong, a top club in the country and a top club in Europe. I think that’s very, very good. I think it’s important and I think it’s also important the message Mr Abramovich and this club are passing now. ‘The decision to accept the [Financial Fair Play] rules and play under the rules I think is a big decision compared with other clubs and other owners that didn’t accept the rules and didn’t want to play under the rules. Chelsea are in a far stronger position than when Abramovich bought the club from Ken Bates in 2003. ‘Will the next 700 games under him be good for the English national side? I believe so. In the first team, we had some important players in the national team. 'John Terry, Ashley Cole, Joe Cole, Frank Lampard, Wayne Bridge, Shaun Wright-Phillips. We had a nucleus of four, five players that were always in the national team. ‘Now we are going through a period where it’s just about Gary Cahill. But we have some young boys coming into the first-team. Ruben [Loftus-Cheek] is already here. Normally, in a few years they should be there [in the national side].’ Gary Cahill (above) is now Chelsea's only senior England international in the current first team squad. Mourinho believes the likes of Ruben Loftus-Cheek (left) and Dominic Solanke will represent Chelsea and England for years to come. Mourinho did not name them, but Dominic Solanke, Patrick Bamford, Lewis Baker and Isaiah Brown are thought to be highly-rated at Chelsea, who supply many of the players in England’s age-group teams. The question is whether their young English players will be given the chance in the first team at a club who can take a huge step towards the title by winning at QPR today. It is a game Chelsea go into mindful of decisive slips in last season’s title race but with the title firmly in their own hands now, Mourinho is confident no mistakes will be made. Chelsea are on the verge of a domestic double after picking up the Capital One Cup in March. Mourinho has won seven major trophies while in charge of the west London club. He added: ‘Don’t make me remember the game against Sunderland because that was the game which stopped us fighting for the title. I don’t want to speak again about that game. ‘Last season we were depending on others. We needed this team to lose a couple of points here, a couple of points there. This situation is different. ‘Now we are in a position where we can be isolated of everything. We don’t have to be watching Man City against Man United. We don’t have to be waiting for what they are going to do. It’s just us.’ Fabio Borini celebrates scoring the winning goal during Sunderland's 2-1 win against Chelsea last season. Mourinho believes last season's defeat against Sunderland'stopped' Chelsea from fighting for the title.

Article: (CNN)Blue Bell ice cream has temporarily shut down one of its manufacturing plants over the discovery of listeria contamination in a serving of ice cream originating from that plant. Public health officials warned consumers Friday not to eat any Blue Bell-branded products made at the company's Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, plant. That includes 3-ounce servings of Blue Bell ice cream from this plant that went to institutions in containers marked with the letters O, P, Q, R, S or T behind the coding date. The warning by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not affect other Blue Bell ice cream, including other 3-ounce servings, not made at the plant. But Blue Bell has recalled other products. The company is shutting down the Broken Arrow facility "out of an abundance of caution" to search for a possible cause of contamination. It is the third time Blue Bell has taken action in light of a listeria outbreak at a Kansas hospital that served the company's ice cream. Listeria monocytogenes was recently found in a cup of ice cream recovered from the hospital. The cup contaminated with the bacteria was produced at the Broken Arrow plant in April 2014, Blue Bell said. And, according to the CDC, listeria bacteria was found in additional samples of the same product that were recovered from the plant. The bacteria in the hospital sample and the factory sample appeared to match each other genetically, the CDC said. But they did not appear identical to listeria samples taken from patients infected in the Kansas outbreak. In a separate outbreak in Texas, the CDC did find that listeria samples taken from patients who came down with listeriosis between 2010 and 2014 in a hospital that served 3-ounce Blue Bell cups matched the listeria in recovered samples. None of this means the ice cream is the source of either spate of the infections. "Investigation to determine whether these illnesses are related to exposure to Blue Bell products is ongoing," the CDC said. In early March, in light of the Kansas listeria outbreak, Blue Bell recalled a group of products made at a plant in Texas. It later added 3-ounce cup servings to the recall. Five people were infected and three died in the past year in Kansas from listeria that might be linked to Blue Bell Creameries products, according to the CDC. All five of them were hospitalized at the same hospital before developing listeriosis, the CDC said. At least four of them had consumed milkshakes made with Blue Bell ice cream before developing the infection. "We are devastated and know that Blue Bell has to be and can be better than this," Paul Kruse, Blue Bell CEO and president, said in a statement. "Quality and safety have always been our top priorities. We are deeply saddened and concerned for all those who have been affected." The CDC advises that individuals and institutions should check their freezers for the recalled products and throw them away. In a statement on its website, Blue Bell said "this recall in no way includes Blue Bell ice cream half gallons, pints, quarts, 3 gallons or other 3 oz. cups." This has been the first product recall in the 108-year history of Blue Bell Creameries, the company said. Listeriosis is a serious infection caused by eating food contaminated with listeria, and primarily affects the elderly, pregnant women, newborns and people with weakened immune systems, according to the CDC. Symptoms of a listeria infection are fever and muscle aches, sometimes associated with diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. In the United States, an estimated 1,600 people become seriously ill each year, and approximately 16% of these illnesses result in death. Cervical infections caused by listeriosis in pregnant women may result in stillbirth or spontaneous abortion during the second or third trimesters. CNN's Debra Goldschmidt, Amanda Watts and Jacque Wilson contributed to this report.

Article: Siem de Jong played 45 minutes for Newcastle Under 21s on his comeback from a collapsed lung. The 26-year-old made way at the break after coming through the first half of United's 2-0 defeat to Derby County at St James' Park. De Jong has made just one Premier League start since his £6million arrival from Ajax last summer. Newcastle midfielder Siem de Jong played 45 minutes for Peter Beardsley's Under 21 side on Wednesday. Farrend Rawson (third from right) is congratulated by his team-mates after scoring at St James' Park. He tore his thigh muscle in September and was days away from returning in February when, for the second time in two years, he suffered a collapsed lung and underwent surgery. De Jong was expected to miss the remainder of the season but now has an outside chance of featuring in the final six matches. However, on the evidence of a subdued half against the Rams, Sunday's visit of Spurs will almost certainly come too soon. Newcastle striker Adam Armstrong (right) is pulled back by Derby's Max Lowe. Armstrong (left) heads a cross towards Derby's goal but his effort flies wide of the post. Meanwhile, forgotten man Facundo Ferreyra replaced De Jong at the break. The 24-year-old Argentinian striker arrived on a season-long loan from Shakhtar Donetsk last summer but is yet to make his senior debut having been plagued by a string of injuries. Derby's victory arrived courtesy of second-half goals from Alefe Santos and Farrend Rawson.

Article: (CNN)The classic video game "Space Invaders" was developed in Japan back in the late 1970's -- and now their real-life counterparts are the topic of an earnest political discussion in Japan's corridors of power. Luckily, Japanese can sleep soundly in their beds tonight as the government's top military official earnestly revealed that the country's Air Self Defense Force (ASDF) had never encountered an extraterrestrial unidentified flying object. Responding to a query from flamboyant former wrestler-turned-lawmaker Antonio Inoki, Defense Minister Gen Nakatani told the Diet, Japan's parliament, that his jets had, to date, never come across any UFOs from outer space. "When the Air Self Defense Force detects indications of an unidentified flying object that could violate our country's airspace, it scrambles fighter jets if necessary and makes visual observation," Nakatani said. He continued: "They sometimes find birds or flying objects other than aircraft but I don't know of a case of finding an unidentified flying object believed to have come over from anywhere other than Earth." Inoki has appeared in the U.S.-based WWE -- which describes him as "among the most respected men in sports-entertainment" -- and is the founder of the New Japan Pro Wrestling organization. He entered Japan's Upper House for a second stint in politics in 2013. He also famously fought Muhammad Ali in 1976, in one of the first-ever mixed-discipline matches, which would later pave the way for today's wildly popular Mixed Martial Arts contests. Before his return to politics he was a regular fixture on Japanese TV variety shows and has promoted a slew of products, from hot sauce to banks. The maverick politician also traveled to Iraq in 1990 to try to secure the release of Japanese hostages, and has more recently attempted to replicate former NBA star Dennis Rodman's "basketball diplomacy" by staging a wrestling tournament in North Korea. He reportedly converted to Islam in the 1990s, although he says he practices both Islam and Buddhism. The lawmaker, who is universally known in Japan for his colossal chin and once-ever-present red scarf -- these days often replaced with a red necktie -- as much as for his political achievements, had asked a Upper House Budget Committee meeting if aircraft were ever scrambled to meet extraterrestrial threats, and if research was being done into alien visitors, prompting Nakatani's response. Inoki also claims to have seen a UFO with his own eyes, but admitted that he didn't know personally if aliens existed. The exchange wasn't the first time Japanese politicians have discussed the implications of visitors from another planet. In 2007 then-Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba pondered the legal ramifications, under Japan's pacifist constitution, of a defense against an invasion from outer space.

Article: Sport's propensity to play mind games with its protagonists was rarely more obviously stated than after qualifying for the Chinese Grand Prix, when Nico Rosberg cursed his Mercedes team. Hamilton, the world champion, was relaxed and delighted having taken pole but Rosberg, his team-mate, was grim-faced, demoralised and made his first public criticism of his team. Nico Rosberg will start behind pole-sitter Lewis Hamilton with Sebastian Vettel third on the grid in China. Rosberg cut a frustrated figure in the paddock after he missed out on pole to Hamilton by just 0.042secs. Rosberg was only four-hundredths of a second behind the Briton and will start second on the grid. Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari is third, nearly a second adrift of Hamilton. But Rosberg was visibly angry after the Mercedes pit-wall brains put him under unnecessary ‘pressure’. The German was the last driver out for his final flying lap, meaning he had to rush to get in a competitive time. Rosberg, who is customarily gracious in defeat, fell slightly short of Hamilton’s mark and was grumpy afterwards. He said: ‘It was not ideal to put me under pressure like that. I don’t think it cost me anything, but even the mind-set to know that I have to speed up a bit — we need to look into that. Sparks fly off the back of Rosberg's Mercedes during qualifying for Sunday's race in Shanghai. The German has now been out-qualified by Hamilton at each of the three races this season. ‘Other than that the lap was good  and it is very annoying as the lap is never perfect, so four hundredths is always in it. Tyre degradation is going to be a big issue for the race as we are going to take the tyres right to the limit. So there are many opportunities.’ Poor old Rosberg was cock of the walk in the early and middle parts of last season, but he seems terribly lacklustre since Hamilton won the title. Even his Mercedes boss, Niki Lauda, said he should ‘sort himself out’ — a statement on Rosberg’s psyche rather than his work ethic. Whether he has the speed to match Hamilton may be at the centre of his anger. The Briton set his fastest time on his penultimate lap. It was enough. Rosberg, though, got closer to Hamilton than he has recently. McLaren will again be towards the back of the grid with Jenson Button 17th and Fernando Alonso 18th. Barely a hair’s breadth separated the former champions. Button said: ‘I guess we hoped we might be just a bit closer than we were today. In practice, we’d looked a bit more competitive, certainly. ‘We’d found a reasonably good balance with the car, in fact, but the lap-time isn’t quite there yet.’ Hamilton will start from the front of the pack as he bids to win his fourth grand prix in China.

Nico Rosberg was the last driver out of the pit-lane and was forced to turn in a quicker out-lap than he would have liked ahead of his final shot at pole. The German narrowly lost out  to his team-mate Lewis Hamilton. Rosberg was just 0.042secs slower than his Mercedes rival. Rosberg also said: 'Oh, come on, guys', over the team radio after he was informed he'd missed out on pole for Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix.

Article: (CNN)Residents of central Sanaa, the Yemeni capital, have learned the hard way that key strategic bombing targets are located in their neighborhoods: Detonating ordnance has been shattering their windows and doors. And fighting has killed hundreds of people in less than two weeks. The Saudi-led coalition smashed parts of Yemen's Defense Ministry Central Command in the capital over the weekend, senior Yemeni officials said. Under the rain of coalition bombs, the Houthis, who are Shiites in a majority Sunni country, still control Sanaa. But the airstrikes have hurt them and destroyed a lot of infrastructure. The electricity has gone out on 16 million Yemenis living in Houthi-held areas, the Yemeni officials said. Many fear they will lose access to clean water as well. Yemen's deposed President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi heaped scorn on top of the airstrikes. He fired his former Army chief of staff, Hussein Khairan, on Sunday. The firing had no practical effect, since Khairan had switched sides weeks ago and is the Houthi rebels' acting defense minister. Hadi is holed up in Saudi Arabia, which is working to defeat his enemies and reinstall him. Fighting has ended dozens of lives each day. On Monday, more than 50 people died in the port city of Aden alone, where Houthis and their allies are battling troops loyal to Hadi on the ground, Agence France-Press reported. Since the bombing campaign and intense fighting began just over a week ago, some 600 people are estimated to have been killed. Many more have been wounded, and tens of thousands have fled the country. The International Committee of the Red Cross has cried out for a humanitarian ceasefire to let aid in. "Otherwise, put starkly, many more people will die. For the wounded, their chances of survival depend on action within hours, not days," said Robert Mardini, the ICRC's head of operations in the Near and Middle East. "Medical supplies need to be here yesterday," said ICRC spokeswoman Marie-Claire Feghali from Sanaa. "We need to save the lives that can be saved." Saudi Arabia signed off on letting the ICRC into Yemen via two aircraft -- one with medical supplies, the other with workers. But flying in will be hard, since most airlines have canceled their flights, and airstrikes have taken out many airfields. On Monday, the flight loaded with 48 tons of medical supplies was grounded in Djibouti, Feghali said. The ICRC is hoping to fly out in a day or two. Following the ICRC's call, on Saturday the U.N. Security Council discussed the humanitarian situation at Russia's behest. Moscow submitted a draft resolution calling for a halt to the airstrikes by the nine-country regional coalition. The meeting adjourned with no decision announced. One diplomat said the draft was missing key elements. It didn't call for the Houthis to stop fighting or for political talks between the belligerents, the diplomat told CNN on condition of anonymity. Yemen has been descending into chaos in the weeks since Houthi rebels -- who have long complained of being marginalized in the majority Sunni country -- forced Hadi from power. The Houthis put Hadi under house arrest when they overtook Sanaa in January. But Hadi escaped in February, fled to Aden and declared himself to still be president. Houthis and their allies, including those loyal to Hadi's predecessor, then fought Hadi's forces in the Aden area. Hadi fled Aden in late March, ultimately for Saudi Arabia, when the rebels and their military allies advanced on the city. The conflict prompted Saudi Arabia, a predominately Sunni nation and Yemen's northern neighbor, and other Arab nations to intervene with force. The Houthis are allied with Iran, Saudi Arabia's bitter rival across the Persian Gulf, and Riyadh does not want an proxy of Iran in power on its border. Complicating matters in Yemen is the fact that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula -- not the Houthis or the forces loyal to Hadi -- holds sway in the country's east. AQAP is considered one of the most ruthless branches of the terrorist organization. It has taken advantage of the chaos to overrun one city and break prisoners out of jail. Hadi's government had cooperated with the United States to fight AQAP, but with the Houthi takeover, that arrangement has evaporated, and the terror group operates generally unchecked.

Article: A youngster admiring his catch was left surprised when the fish jumped up and slapped him in the face. Quinn Patrick was on a fishing trip with his dad at Snow Lake, Indiana when the pair caught a bowfin, videoed lying lifeless on a concrete dock. Crouching over the fish, Quinn deliberates whether someone should put it back in the water. When suddenly the Bowfin propels itself from the ground and slaps the youngster straight in the face with its large tail. The sound of the fish making impact with the youngster’s face is not dissimilar to a sound effect used in a cartoon. Recoiling, Quinn stumbles backwards in shock as his dad begins laughing – prompting the youngster to laugh along with him. Quinn Patrick was on a fishing trip with his dad at Snow Lake, Indiana when the pair caught a Bowfin. The young boy then states: ‘Dad there’s blood on him,’ and his father replies by gently explaining that the fish got hurt. Worried, the youngster replies rather sweetly: ‘By me?’ Before his dad reassures him that he is not to blame. The video concludes with the father discussing the size of the Bowfin’s teeth. The Bowfin propels itself from the ground and slaps the youngster straight in the face with its large tail. Bowfin are native to North America and are commonly found in east America, south Ontario and Quebec. They are demersal freshwater fish, which means they live and feed at the bottom of lakes and seas. And are piscivore, which means they are carnivorous and predominately eat other fish. Common names for the fish include mudfish, dogfish, mud pike, griddle, grinnel, cypress trout and choupique. The sound of the fish making impact with the youngster’s face is not dissimilar to a sound effect used in a cartoon.

Article: (CNN)Film director David Lynch has confirmed he will no longer direct the revival of "Twin Peaks" -- a cult 1990s television show that was set to return in 2016. The offbeat TV series, created by Lynch and Mark Frost, featured a quirky FBI agent who went to the Pacific Northwest town of Twin Peaks to investigate the mysterious murder of a high school girl named Laura Palmer. The groundbreaking series is considered one of the most influential shows in television history. Lynch broke the news about his departure in a series of tweets, saying that the show's third season will continue without him. He said he felt the network was not offering enough money to produce the show "the way it needed to be done." Lynch also wrote that he had personally called the actors over the weekend to let them know he would no longer be directing. Showtime Network, which will air the nine-episode comeback, released a statement saying they were "saddened" by Lynch's decision. "We were saddened to read David Lynch's statement today since we believed we were working towards solutions with David and his reps on the few remaining deal points," read the statement. "Showtime also loves the world of Twin Peaks and we continue to hold out hope that we can bring it back in all its glory with both of its extraordinary creators, David Lynch and Mark Frost, at its helm." Showtime announced they would produce a third season in October last year. Actor Kyle MacLachlan, who played the coffee-obsessed FBI agent Dale Cooper in the original series, had confirmed he would reprise the lead role for the new season.

Article: Graeme McDowell insisted he would never consider not playing the Masters despite another frustrating experience at Augusta National. McDowell carded a final round of 73 on Sunday to finish six over par and is now a combined 24 over for his eight appearances in the year's first major championship. 'I can't imagine not coming here,' the former US Open champion said. 'It would be sacrilege not to play here no matter how much it frustrates you as you have to enjoy it for what it is. Graeme McDowell tees off on the third hole during the third round at Augusta on Saturday. 'It is a celebration of golf on my favourite golf course in the world. It is. I love it. But it's unrequited. 'Once I feel like I have got one up on this course it takes two back. I walk away still disappointed a little that I can't score as well as I feel I should round this course. I threw away shots like confetti all week. 'I think it's a puzzle you can solve. I realised my style of putting is not suited to Augusta. I'm going to have to work on a type of speed putting that's going to be suitable. McDowell carded a final round of 73 on Sunday to finish six over par for the tournament. 'You have to be a 'front-edge' putter like Bubba (Watson), I've never seen anyone roll in putts from six feet slower than Bubba. You have to drop them in and I have to adapt to do that round here.' McDowell's score could have been even worse after he was initially given a one-shot penalty for moving his marker as he attempted to swat a bee away from his ball on the third green. However, European Tour chief referee John Paramor rescinded the penalty a few holes later and McDowell added: 'I said could he follow me the rest of the day because he was the first guy who has saved me a shot in a while.' It would be sacrilege not to play here no matter how much it frustrates you,' McDowell said on Sunday.

Article: Queens Park Rangers manager Chris Ramsey has revealed he will have no problem shaking John Terry’s hand in light of the racist comments the former England captain directed at former Rs defender Anton Ferdinand four years ago. Terry, who will line up against Ramsey’s side, was banned for four games and fined £220,000 for the remarks made in October 2011 during Chelsea’s 1-0 defeat at Loftus Road. But Ramsey, the Premier League’s only black manager, thinks the issue has been dealt with. ‘Ultimately, John Terry is a player of Chelsea. I am a manager of QPR. As a man, as a person, I would shake his hand,’ Ramsey said. ‘I don’t know what his feelings are towards me. As long as there wasn’t anything on the field that was unprofessional by him, I would shake his hand. Queens Park Rangers manager Chris Ramsey speaks to the media on Friday ahead of the Chelsea match. Chelsea captain John Terry controls the ball during last weekend's Premier League match against Stoke. Ramsey arrives for Friday's pre-match press conference as QPR prepare to host Chelsea at Loftus Road. ‘The whole episode for British society sat uncomfortably. It’s not something we want to highlight in football. It happened and it’s being dealt with. We have to move on. And hopefully everyone has learned something from it.’ Ramsey revealed that Rio Ferdinand, who labelled Terry an idiot for the abuse aimed at his brother, won’t be fit in time for a reunion with the Chelsea skipper this weekend. But the 52-year-old suspects his player’s one-time England colleague will be on the receiving end of a hostile welcome from the home fans on his return the scene of the unsavoury incident. 'Rio has unfortunately got an injury, he’s had a knock, and it’s recurring, he keeps trying to train,' Ramsey continued. 'He will train this morning. He’s something we miss immensely. We miss his leadership qualities on the pitch. Unfortunately, he won't be involved in the game. ‘Fans are fans, aren’t they? (Terry’s return) is a subject that brings up a lot of different emotions. So it would be odd to think that there isn’t going to be an extra feeling towards that situation.’ QPR defender Anton Ferdinand avoids shaking hands with Terry before a league match in September 2012. Ferdinand and Terry argue during QPR's 1-0 victory against Chelsea at Loftus Road in October 2011. Rio Ferdinand, brother of Anton, will not be fit for Sunday's match against Chelsea.

Article: (CNN)The FBI has confirmed that one of its most wanted terrorists, the Malaysian bomb maker known as Marwan, was killed in an otherwise disastrous raid in the Philippines in January. Marwan, whose real name is Zulkifli bin Hir, was believed by the FBI to a member of southeast Asian terror group Jemaah Islamiyah's central command. The FBI said in February that a DNA sample -- understood to be from a severed finger -- taken from a man killed in a raid in the southern Philippines showed a link with a known relative of Marwan. But the FBI now says tests have confirmed that the dead man was the wanted Islamic extremist. "After a thorough review of forensic data and information obtained from our Philippine law enforcement partners, the FBI has assessed that terrorism subject, Zulkifli Abdhir... is deceased and has been removed from the FBI's list of Most Wanted Terrorists," David Bowdich, assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles field office, told CNN in a statement. The FBI had been offering a $5 million reward for information leading to Marwan's capture in the wake of his 2007 indictment on terror charges in a California court. It accused him of being a supplier of IEDs to terrorist organizations, and having conducted bomb making training for terror groups, including the Philippines-based Abu Sayyaf. Marwan had previously been falsely reported dead after a raid by Philippine security forces in 2012. The Philippines has been fighting an insurgency in the predominantly Muslim south for years, and last year signed a peace agreement with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), the largest rebel group in the region. But in January it launched a surprise raid in pursuit of Marwan at Mamapasono, in the southern province of Maguindanao. The mission went disastrously awry. Forty-four members of the police's elite Special Action Force (SAF) unit were killed in the assault, targeting an area controlled by the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) -- a hardline splinter group which has rejected the peace deal with the Philippines government. According to a report released by the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict (IPAC) last month, the BIFF faction sheltering Marwan had sworn allegiance to ISIS. In the immediate aftermath of the assault, the SAF company charged with executing Marwan came under fire, before another SAF company stationed in nearby MILF territory as a "blocking force" became engaged in an eight-hour firefight with MILF fighters. According to the IPAC report, the SAF "blocking" company eventually ran out of ammunition and only one of their number survived,. Eighteen MILF fighters were killed and a number of BIFF fighters may also died. The clash shattered a three-year ceasefire with the MILF, authorities said. A national day of mourning was declared as the men were laid to rest. Bowdich expressed the FBI's "sincere condolences to the brave officers of the Special Action Force who lost their lives while attempting to apprehend this dangerous fugitive." While an SAF superintendent said at a eulogy for the fallen commandos that their sacrifice had been worth it, controversy has dogged the botched mission in the Philippines. The IPAC report argued that the "single-minded focus" of authorities on killing Marwan has threatened the peace agreement with the MILF, which is yet to cross the final hurdle of being passed into law by the Philippines Congress. "The best chance the southern Philippines has ever had for peace may now be in jeopardy," read the report, which argued that the Mamapasano fiasco was the result of a misguided emphasis on killing Marwan. The report argued that, although Marwan had aided terror attacks and provided funds and equipment to MILF and Abu Sayyaf, he was not "the master bomber that his reputation suggested." Yet for the Philippines authorities and their U.S. allies, killing Marwan had become such a priority that security forces bypassed the mechanisms that had been established to alert the MILF to such operations, for fear of word leaking to their target. The report quoted an anonymous Indonesian associate of Marwan's who described the Malaysian as "a little snake who has been blown up into a dragon."

Article: The first lady of North Korea has appeared in public for the first time since December as part of celebrations marking the birthday of the country's founding leader Kim Il-Sung. A grinning Ri Sol-Ju, wearing what appeared to be a wedding ring on her left hand, was pictured clapping next to her smiling husband Kim Jong-un during a men's football match at Kim Il Sung Stadium on Monday, the North Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said. The images of the couple at a podium flanked by top party officials were published in state media. Scroll down for video. Laughing with her husband, Kim Jong-un, as the pair watch a celebratory football match, Ri Sol-Ju is seen for the first time since December. The match was being held as part of a lavish series of events celebrating the 103rd birthday of Kim Il-Sung, the young leader's grandfather, which falls on Wednesday. North Korea designates the 'Day of the Sun' as a rare two-day national holiday, with art performances, exhibitions and sporting events, and pilgrimages to the late leader's birthplace in Pyongyang. A former member of the North's Unhasu Orchestra, Ri was last seen in public in December 2014, when she and her husband attended a ceremony to commemorate the third anniversary of the death of Kim Jong-un's father, Kim Jong-Il. Their marriage was only revealed in July 2012 when pictures emerged of a young woman accompanying Kim at official events in a break from the past, when the North's first ladies were kept out of the limelight. She was pictured wearing stylish, expensive-looking outfits and on one occasion sported what appeared to be a Christian Dior handbag, in a country plagued by chronic poverty. Their marriage was only revealed in July 2012 when pictures emerged of a young woman accompanying Kim at official events. But Ri has been out of the spotlight since December for unknown reasons. The Kim dynasty has ruled the isolated state for nearly seven decades with an iron fist and pervasive personality cult. Kim Il-Sung led North Korea from its establishment in 1948 until his death on July 8, 1994. He was succeeded by his son, Kim Jong-Il, who also ruled until his death in December 2011 when power was transferred to his son and current leader Kim Jong-un. KCNA said 'an endless stream of people' was visiting, Mangyongdae, the birthplace of Kim Il-Sung, as the 'Day of the Sun' draws near. The images of the couple at a podium flanked by top party officials were published in state media. On Sunday more than 800 runners took place in an international marathon watched by hundreds of fans, including some 600 from abroad, as part of the celebrations. 'Attending the race were more than 600 marathon fans from dozens of countries including Malaysia, Singapore, Sweden, Finland, UK and Italy,' KCNA said. The North announced in February that the April 12 marathon would only be open to domestic runners this year, because of lingering concerns over the Ebola epidemic in west Africa. But it last month reversed a ban on foreigners taking part in the annual run, after lifting strict travel restrictions aimed at keeping out the Ebola virus. Ri Sol-ju here is seen wearing a wedding ring and her husband Kim Jong-un an expensive watch.  Last week he appeared to be wearing a bandage on the same wrist after sustaining an injury. It has now been removed.

Article: (CNN)The presence of a harmful pesticide at a luxury villa in the U.S. Virgin Islands may have resulted in the illness of a Delaware family, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Friday. Paramedics were called last week to a rented villa at the Sirenusa resort in St. John after the family of four fell ill. They had rented the villa from March 14 to March 22, and were later hospitalized. The illness was reported to the EPA on March 20. "Our preliminary results do show that there was a presence of methyl bromide in the unit where the family was staying," said Elias Rodriguez, an EPA spokesman. Exposure to methyl bromide can result in serious health effects, including central nervous system and respiratory system damage, according to the EPA. The use of the pesticide is restricted in the United States because of its acute toxicity. It's not allowed to be used indoors. Only certified professionals are permitted to use it in certain agricultural settings. "It's an ongoing investigation; we're still on the island doing our assessment," Rodriguez said. "We have been doing different types of air sampling and wipe sampling." Final test results were expected next week. The EPA is working with local government agencies to investigate whether the family was made ill after a fumigation at the resort on March 18 and whether any environmental regulations or laws were violated. "Pesticides can be very toxic, and it is critically important that they be applied properly and used only as approved by EPA," said Judith A. Enck, a regional administrator for the EPA. "The EPA is actively working to determine how this happened and will make sure steps are taken to prevent this from happening to others at these vacation apartments or elsewhere." Depending on the season, the luxury villa where the family stayed rents between $550 and $1,200 per night. Sea Glass Vacations, which acts as a rental agent for several units at Sirenusa, said that the unit directly below the one where the family stayed was recently treated for pests, but that their unit was not treated. The company said it licensed an outside company, Terminix, for the pest control services. "Sea Glass Vacations does not treat the units it manages for pests but instead relies on licensed professionals for pest control services," the company said in a statement. The U.S. Department of Justice has initiated a criminal investigation into the matter, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing made Monday by ServiceMaster Global Holdings, the parent company of Terminix. In an email to CNN, a spokesman for Terminix wrote that the company is "committed to performing all work... in a manner that is safe for our customers, employees, the public and the environment" and is "looking into this matter internally, and cooperating with authorities." "We're thinking about the family, and we join the community in wishing them a speedy recovery," Terminix wrote. James Maron, an attorney who has been a spokesman for the family, has not responded to requests for comment. The SEC filing described the injuries to the family members as "serious."

Article: Chelsea's Eden Hazard and Arsenal's Santi Cazorla are set to reach a Premier League milestone this weekend when they each make their 100th appearance. Both players have been hugely influential since they moved to London in the summer of 2012, but who has been the most exciting import to watch? Here, Sportsmail's reporters choose the player they most enjoy seeing in action. Eden Hazard (L) and Santi Cazorla are both set to make their 100th Premier League appearance this weekend. Lee Clayton. Cazorla has wonderful balance. So does Hazard. Cazorla scores important goals. So does Hazard. Cazorla is two-footed. So is Hazard. Cazorla dances past opponents. So does Hazard. So, while there is not a lot to choose between them and Hazard is likely to get the most picks in this article, I am going for Cazorla. It's a personal choice. He is a wonderful footballer. I have paid to watch them both (and I will pay to watch them both again), but the little Spanish magician edges it for me. VERDICT: CAZORLA. Cazorla, pictured in action against Burnley, has been an influential part of Arsenal's midfield this season. Ian Ladyman. I remember when Manchester City baulked at paying Hazard's wages when the Belgian was up for grabs in 2012. Back then City thought the young forward had a rather high opinion of his own worth for a player who was yet to play in a major European league. In the early days of his time at Chelsea, it looked as though City may have been right. He showed flashes of brilliance but also looked rather too easy to push off the ball. Roll forward to 2015, however, and the 24-year-old has developed in to one of the most important players in the Barclays Premier League. Brave, strong and ambitious, Hazard plays on the front foot and with only one thought in this mind. Rather like Cristiano Ronaldo, he has also developed in to the type of player ever defender hates, simply because he gets back up every time he is knocked to the ground. He would get in every team in the Premier League and is one of the reasons Chelsea will win the title this season. VERDICT: HAZARD. Hazard controls the ball under pressure from Stoke midfielder Stephen Ireland at Stamford Bridge. Dominic King. It has to be Hazard. I saw him play for Lille twice in the season before he joined Chelsea – once against St Etienne, the other was what proved to be his final appearance against Nancy. He scored two in the first match, a hat-trick the latter and played a different game to those around him. He hasn't disappointed since arriving here and I love the nonchalance with which he takes a penalty, his low centre of gravity and the way he can bamboozle defenders. If there is such a thing as £32million bargain, it is Hazard. VERDICT: HAZARD. Hazard celebrates after scoring a fine individual goal in Chelsea's 3-2 win against Hull in March. Nick Harris. Now this is a tricky one because while Eden Hazard will frequently embark on a dribble or dink in a pass that will make you nod in appreciation, he'll also miss a penalty and make you groan. Whereas the older Cazorla, less flashy but no less of a technical master, is to my mind more of a fulcrum, more important relatively to the sum of Arsenal's parts than Hazard is to Chelsea. You'll gasp at Hazard but Cazorla's wow factor is richer. That's not to dismiss either: both are brilliant footballers, contributing goals, assists and flair. Any neutral would bite your hand off to have either playing in your team. Forced to pick though, it's Cazorla, for his consistency and crucially doing it in the biggest games. Exhibit A would be Manchester City 0 Arsenal 2 in January; goal, assist, all-round brilliance, against a big team, at an important time. VERDICT: CAZORLA. Cazorla scores from the penalty spot in Arsena's 2-0 away win at Manchester City in January. Riath Al-Samarrai. Eden Hazard for me. Cazorla is an utter delight, a little pinball of a man who is probably the most two-footed player I've seen. Put him in a tight space and then you see what makes him rare among the best. But Hazard is the top player in the Premier League, in my opinion. This is the sixth of his eight seasons as a professional where he has reached double figures and yet he offers so much more than goals (36 in 99 in the Premier League for Chelsea). He can beat a man and, better still, you sense he likes doing it. Technically, his passing and shooting are excellent and he also has a mind capable of sussing out the shapes and systems in front of him. That intelligence, more specifically his speed of thought, is probably what makes separates the good from the brilliant. A complete player who doesn't yet seem to have the complete ego. VERDICT: HAZARD. Hazard gets away from Manchester City duo Fernando (left) and Martin Demichelis at Stamford Bridge. Laurie Whitwell. Has to be Hazard for me. The way he carries the ball through ever tightening spaces and emerges the other side is a joy. Like one of those Indiana Jones impossible escapes from a sliding door or rolling boulder. And his penalties are mesmeric. I could watch them again and again not working out how he does it. VERDICT: HAZARD. Belgium international Hazard scores a header past West Ham goalkeeper Adrian at Upton Park. Sami Mokbel. Both are marvellous players, but I could watch Santi Cazorla all day. When he first arrived in England I remember, whilst sitting in the Upton Park press box, trying to work out whether he was left or right footed. He was wonderful that day as Arsenal cruised to a 3-1 win; it was one of the most complete performances I've seen live. In truth, I've still got no idea whether he's left or right footed. He's that natural on either. Hazard is a phenomenon, but aesthetically no on can touch Cazorla in the Premier League. VERDICT: CAZORLA. Cazorla grins after scoring Arsenal's fourth goal against Aston Villa at the Emirates in February. Jack Gaughan. From a purely artistic sense, Santi Cazorla is probably the most graceful individual on the ball in the entire Premier League. But Eden Hazard provides moments to really stick in the memory. He glides past opponents effortlessly and regularly chips in with important goals - plenty of them stunning in their execution. Worth the ticket alone. The one blot from Cazorla's point of view is that his genius can be fleeting. VERDICT: HAZARD. Sam Cunningham. Jose Mourinho has told him to add more goals to his game to move on a par with Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo and, three years younger than the Argentine and six than the Portuguese, he is not far from doing that. I've watched Hazard countless times at Stamford Bridge this season and he makes the game seem like an art form with his movement, dribbling and passing. Cazorla can excite at times, but he is nowhere near consistently reaching Hazard's level. For me there is no contest between the pair. VERDICT: HAZARD. Hazard tucks home yet another penalty during Chelsea 2-1 win against Stoke City last weekend. Craig Hope. I would far rather have Hazard in my team, but I can't help but feel the excitement has been stripped from him under Jose Mourinho. Efficient, technically brilliant, effective and hard-working he most certainly is - and he will be crowned PFA Player of the Year - but he is no longer the daring dribbler of whom we heard so much about during his teenage years in France. He is, though, arguably a better player for Mourinho's influence. Cazorla, meanwhile, would never thrive under Mourinho, there is too much of Juan Mata about him. But there is no doubt he is thrilling to watch on his day - it's just a shame those days aren't as frequent as they should be for a player of his calibre. VERDICT: HAZARD. RESULT: HAZARD 7-3 CAZORLA. Hazard has been voted as a more exciting player than Cazorla in Sportsmail's survey.

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence.
Chelsea star Eden Hazard is set to make his 100th top-flight appearance. Santi Cazorla should hit the same milestone when Arsenal meet Burnley. Both players have impressed since moving to the Premier League in 2012. Hazard has more goals this season but Cazorla has one more assist. Sportsmail's reporters choose the player who has excited them the most.

Article: (CNN)Comedian Chris Rock made light of racial disparities in police treatment of whites and blacks with a tongue-in-cheek guide to not being beaten by the police. He encapsulated the frustration and grief caused by a New York grand jury's decision not to indict a white police officer in the death of a black man with a simple tweet: "This one was on film." Now, he's stirring things up again with a series of tweets documenting three traffic stops in seven weeks. "Stopped by the cops again wish me luck," he posted early Tuesday, along with a photo showing him behind the wheel of a car with what looks like blue police lights in the background. He posted similar photos in February. Many African-Americans have long bemoaned the phenomenon of being pulled over for no apparent reason, calling it "driving while black." Blacks are about 30% more likely to be pulled over by police than whites, according to figures reported by the Bureau of Justice Statistics in 2013. And in amid increased conversation over race and policing after the high-profile deaths last year of Eric Garner in New York and Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, the issue is even more sensitive. Rock hasn't commented on the tweets and didn't say how the police stop turned out. He got lots of support on Twitter. "My heart legit dropped, no kidding," one Twitter fan posted. Many praised him for documenting the stops. Some accused him of race-baiting. But one bit of advice in particular lit up social media. Actor Isaiah Washington urged Rock to "#Adapt" to avoid racial profiling. "I sold my $90,000.00 Mercedes G500 and bought 3 Prius's, because I got tired of being pulled over by Police," Washington tweeted. Some saw that as a sell-out, saying Rock shouldn't have to take steps others might not have to as a way to avoid being pulled over. "Let me guess..you also make sure your pants are pulled up as well?." Twitter user YeshaCallahan posted. Appearing on CNN, Washington defended the tweet, saying he wanted to "excite a conversation." Years ago, Rock filmed a sketch for his "Chris Rock" show on HBO in which he detailed ways to avoid being beaten by police as a black man. Besides obeying the law, he suggested bringing a white friend along for the ride. He did just that last year in a segment of "Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee" with Jerry Seinfeld. The two chat as Seinfeld drives an orange Lamborghini. And what happened? They get pulled over after Seinfeld goes a bit heavy on the gas. "Here's the crazy thing," Rock tells Seinfeld as the police officer stops the duo. "If you weren't here, I'd be scared."

Article: Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has said he hopes Burnley escape relegation after seeing his side have to fight to gain a narrow 1-0 victory at Turf Moor. Wenger has been praised by Burnley boss Sean Dyche this season and last night the Gunners boss repaid the compliment by saying: 'It would be a shame for Burnley to go down.' Arsenal were made to fight hard for their eighth win in a row and Wenger said: 'I understand now why they took points from other teams like Chelsea and Manchester City. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has said he hopes Burnley escape relegation from the Premier League. Burnley manager Sean Dyche shakes hands with Wenger following Arsenal 1-0 victory at Turf Moor. 'When you see their performance tonight (Saturday), I am surprised by their plight near the bottom. They have a great solidarity and organisation in their side. Burnley have won only once in 11 games, a famous 1-0 victory against City, but Dyche still believes they can escape the drop. They are currently two points from safety but face three fellow strugglers Hull City, Leicester City and Aston Villa in their final six fixtures. They have played seven teams at the top of the table in their last eight games. Aaron Ramsey (right) scored the only goal of the game, but it was enough to secure three points. The Welsh midfielder points to the sky as he celebrates putting Arsenal into a early 1-0 lead. 'We have six big games coming and we have shown this season we can score goals,' he said. 'We are not naïve. We are willing and have an appetite to succeed.' 'The outside world thought we might not take anything from our last seven games. There are teams around us who are having an awkward time and maybe they feel the next matches more than us. 'It could well go do the wire. I am only concerned about us. I know if our performances are right, we will win games. I think we have measured ourselves well against the top sides and now there are going to be different type of games, edgy games.' Burnley were unlucky not to draw level after this acrobatic attempt was saved by David Ospina.

Article: Hong Kong (CNN)Six people were hurt after an explosion at a controversial chemical plant in China's southeastern Fujian province sparked a huge fire, provincial authorities told state media. The plant, located in Zhangzhou city, produces paraxylene (PX), a reportedly carcinogenic chemical used in the production of polyester films and fabrics. The blast occurred at an oil storage facility Monday night after an oil leak, though local media has not reported any toxic chemical spill. Five out of six people were injured by broken glass and have been sent to the hospital for treatment, Xinhua news agency reported. More than 600 firefighters were sent to battle the blaze and the fire is now under control, the Zhangzhou fire department wrote on their official microblogging account Tuesday morning. Residents living close to the plant had heard the explosion and took to Weibo to post photos of the fire. One user wrote that he heard a loud blast and felt slight tremors. The plant was hit by another explosion in July 2013, although there were no reports of casualties or toxic leaks at the time. Though demonstrations are illegal in China, the construction of PX plants has sparked protests, which have occasionally turned violent, in several cities in recent years. The Zhangzhou plant was slated for Xiamen -- a densely populated city in the southeast of the country. However, it provoked an angry backlash in 2007 due to pollution concerns and prompted the local government to relocate the factory to its current, more remote location.

Article: (CNN)The United States Department of Justice has named a new defendant in the war on drugs, and the charges are serious indeed. A 15-count indictment filed in federal court in California bristles with accusations of conspiracies, transporting prescription pharmaceuticals dispensed with illegal prescriptions, violations of the Controlled Substances Act, misbranding charges, and money laundering charges. Who is this menace to society? FedEx. Yes, the courier delivery service. Wait, can companies even be charged with crimes?  Where would a FedEx be incarcerated?  Is there a corporate Shawshank Prison?  How does one fit a company for a prison jumpsuit? It turns out a corporation can indeed be prosecuted like a person. It's a practice the Supreme Court has approved of for over a century. In fact, in many ways they are easier to prosecute than people.  Corporations don't have all the same inconvenient constitutional rights as citizens accused of crimes. Imprisoning convicted citizens is expensive, but corporate convictions, on the other hand, turn tidy profits for the U.S. government, with zero prison overhead. Even if corporations can be held criminally liable, should a courier service like FedEx be held liable for "possessing" what bad guys may send through the service? The answer, according to FedEx, is not just "No," but a "No" so conclusive that this case should never see a courtroom. The company maintains that it is innocent. It has a point. "Possession" is an elusive concept.  When it comes to drugs, the law recognizes two kinds of possession: actual and constructive. Actual possession is when you have physical control over the contraband. When you have a gun in your hand or drugs in your pocket, you "actually" possess those things. The somewhat hazier concept of "constructive possession" means you can "possess" something without even having it on your person, as long as you have ownership, dominion or control over the contraband or the property where it is found. For example, the government would argue that while you may not have actual possession of the 5,000 OxyContin pills in the trunk of your car parked in your driveway, you "constructively" possessed them. Conversely, sometimes you can be holding something in your hand or have it in your vehicle, but not "possess" it either actually or constructively, in the eyes of the law. Such is the case with couriers who routinely drive to your home, walk up to your door and hand you a package, completely ignorant about what is inside it. It's hard to argue the UPS guy intentionally "possessed" your subscription to porno mags, in their nondescript brown packaging. That is the idea behind the "common carrier" exception to possession, and a large part of FedEx's compelling legal argument. A "common carrier" is one who offers its services to members of the public -- without much discretion -- and is engaged in the business of transporting persons or property for compensation. The public policy reasons behind "common carrier" exemptions make sense; the industry simply couldn't function if every driver, courier and handler who touches a valid shipment of OxyContin had to obtain a prescription for opiates to be legally allowed to deliver it to your front door. That would lead to an absurd result. That's why the Controlled Substances Act and the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act allow common carriers to lawfully possess controlled substances, so long as it is in the usual course of their business. Of course, this is not a permission slip for drug runners to avoid liability by calling themselves "common carriers." That's why the "usual course of business" language acts as an additional safety measure. In court papers, FedEx's lawyers offer the example of an airline whose sole activity was flying controlled substances from Jamaica to Miami. This would not be acting in the usual course of business of a common carrier, since this imaginary airline is not offering its services to the public, generally. On the other hand, FedEx argues that it is indeed a common carrier, performing the normal duties of a common carrier, because (a) it is engaged in the business of transportation of property and (b) it offers its services to the public generally. It's hard to imagine extending liability to common carriers for possession of contraband. Does this mean a Greyhound bus driver becomes liable for marijuana possessed by a passenger? The bus driver would argue he has no reason to know if a particular passenger is carrying drugs. But if the guy boards the bus with a Grateful Dead T-shirt and a set of bongos, shouldn't the driver at least have a hunch? That seems dangerously close to profiling. Is this another illogical straw man argument? Maybe. Obviously, the Department of Justice disagrees, which is why it has brought this criminal prosecution. According to the indictment, from at least as early as 2004, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Food and Drug Administration, and members of Congress put FedEx on notice that illegal Internet pharmacies were using its shipping services to distribute controlled substances and prescription drugs in violation of the Controlled Substances Act, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and numerous state laws. The indictment alleges that as early as 2004, FedEx knew that it was delivering drugs to dealers and addicts. FedEx's couriers in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia expressed safety concerns that were circulated to FedEx senior management. The DOJ is making the argument that even though FedEx carries and delivers whatever is handed to it by the public, FedEx knew or should have known in specific instances that it was involving itself in suspicious drug activity. It raises a larger question, though: Why do we prosecute inanimate objects that we can't even incarcerate? The answer is the same reason that the drug dealers deal drugs, and drug smugglers smuggle them: Money. Power. The government in these cases gets to impose its will and policy upon large corporations -- in this case, it would be to force FedEx to help law enforcement in policing shady pharmaceutical transportation. The government also gets to extract gargantuan sums of money from corporations in "deferred prosecution agreements." The reason you don't see a lot of corporate trials is because most companies prefer to enter into such agreements; for a company, a public prosecution alone would be tantamount to a death sentence, whether or not it's found guilty. Still, every defense attorney would love to offer the option to his or her human clients of avoiding felony conviction and a potential life sentence -- by agreeing to pay some fines. Don't get me wrong: I'm all about prosecuting the black market, especially if that means prosecuting the guys who send us those spam emails to our work accounts with "V1AGRA" in the subject line, for our co-workers to see while we go to the bathroom. I want those guys locked up for sure. I'm just not sure that FedEx has anything to do with the kingpins of the "FR33 CYALIS" email campaign. The DOJ's underlying intentions are noble enough -- this is an attack on the supply line of the illegal drug market by attacking the actual supply chain. It makes good strategic sense. It might seem like good financial sense in the short run, with the millions in fines extracted from corporations, but that money has to come from somewhere. It's just a matter of time before that trickles down to job cuts and less leg room on our flights. It probably doesn't make good legal sense either. Yes, we have been treating corporations as fictional "persons" for centuries in some ways -- but it's silly to treat them as persons in all ways. FedEx has a strong argument for dismissal in this case, but even if not, it won't be swapping its logo orange for prison orange anytime soon.

Article: Brazilian teams are on alert because of a dengue fever outbreak that has already affected some of the country's top clubs. Three players were diagnosed with the mosquito-borne disease this week, including Corinthians striker Paolo Guerrero. Players have been forced to use insect repellent during practice sessions and clubs have asked health officials to check their training centres for mosquito breeding sites. Brazilian football clubs have been put on alert after a dengue fever outbreak. In addition to Guerrero, Palmeiras reserve goalkeeper Aranha and young Santos striker Leo Cittadini also have been diagnosed with the disease and won't be able to help their teams in the final stages of the Sao Paulo state championship this month. 'We have to find a way to stay away from this little mosquito,' Palmeiras midfielder Arouca said. Guerrero, Corinthians' top striker, will also miss his team's last two games in the group stage of the Copa Libertadores, Latin America's top club tournament. The Peruvian has been hospitalized since Saturday and there is no word on when he will be released. Corinthians striker Paolo Guerrero is one of three players that have already been diagnosed. The players affected will need about two weeks to fully recover from the disease, which causes extreme joint pain and headaches. There is no cure, but is rarely fatal. Cases of dengue fever have increased significantly across Brazil this year, with most of them reported in Sao Paulo state. Brazil's health ministry said there have been more than 460,000 cases of the disease in the country in 2015, which accounts for almost 5,000 cases a day. More than 130 people have died so far this year, the ministry said. Corinthians midfielder Renato Augusto said some players have been practicing with pants and long sleeves to try to avoid the mosquitoes. 'We are afraid, of course,' he said. 'It turns out it's not only the defenders we have to worry about these days.' Guerrero, who used to play for Bayern Munich, in action for Corinthians in a Copa Libertadores match. Another Corinthians player, defender Rodrigo Sam, was hospitalized for two weeks after getting the disease earlier this year. Health officials inspected Corinthians' training center this week and said there were no signs of breeding sites for mosquitoes carrying dengue. The popular Brazilian club said the players were likely infected while away from the team's premises. Still, doctor Ivan Grava said players would continue to use insect repellent and, when possible, the team would not practice during times mosquitoes were more likely to appear. Another top Brazilian club affected by dengue fever this year was Sao Paulo. One of the team's doctors had the disease, and players recently expressed their concern about having to play a match in a city where the disease had spread quickly.

Article: Given the inexorable march of the past 12 months in one direction, perhaps it is only appropriate that Rory McIlroy should spend the eve of the Masters on Wednesday with a member of the celebrated boy band of that name. But it is not lookalike Harry Styles who will carry the Northern Irishman's bag in the par-three tournament but keen golfer Niall Horan as McIlroy looks for a little light relief before his first attempt to complete a career Grand Slam. One Direction released their debut album in 2011, the same year McIlroy won his first major, so you could say they have mirrored each other, hit for greatest hit. Rory McIlroy watches a tee shot during a practice round prior to the start of the 2015 Masters Tournament. McIlroy alongside his caddie Caroline Wozniacki during the 2014 Par 3 Contest  in Augusta. McIlroy celebrates with his  Wozniacki on the 9th hole during  the Par 3 contest at Augusta National Golf Club. At last year's Masters, McIlroy piqued the interest of one or two photographers when then fiancee Caroline Wozniacki donned the caddie's famous white boiler suit. He might find the curiosity levels are even greater this time, for One Direction are even more popular in the US than in Britain. Between them, Niall, an honorary member at Mullingar, Westmeath, and Rory might do more to stir up interest in golf among the young than any number of 'old fogey' initiatives. 'We met in Australia at the end of last year and he was saying he had never been to The Masters,' said McIlroy. 'I said if you're available on the Wednesday you're more than welcome to carry the bag. Niall's really excited.' Niall Horan will swap girls screams for Augusta greens as he caddies for golfer McIlroy. McIlroy hits a putt in the rain during a practice round prior to the start of the 2015 Masters Tournament. McIlroy looked more subdued than excited at his press conference yesterday, possibly because he knew what was coming. On the one hand, he feels as ready as he ever will for his tilt at history. On the other, he had to spend 30 minutes with journalists wanting to trawl over his poor record at Augusta. Here is a sample: Why is your record so bad on the par fives, Rory? Why have you never birdied either the first or the 10th holes? Why have you left here for the past five years with at least one 77 on your score card? What the hell's wrong given all the advantages offered by your length off the tee? McIlroy  walks over the Nelson Bridge with caddie J.P. Fitzgerald during a practice round. To be fair, he answered them all with politeness. After all, there was nothing there he had not analysed and dissected countless times himself. McIlroy knows better than anyone he has no chance unless he does better on the long holes. He brought up the point raised in the Sportsmail graphic from last Saturday, which compared his record on the par fives last year with that of winner Bubba Watson. 'Just look at the two par fives on the back nine on Sunday,' he said. 'I had a nine iron in my hand for my second shot on both and I walked off with two sixes. Two fours I'd have finished third. McIlroy waits under an umbrella during a practice round prior to the start of the 2015 Masters Tournament. 'It's something I've been thinking about a lot. Look at Bubba, who played them in eight-under for the week to my level par and beat me by eight shots. 'I've just been too aggressive at times. I had four sixes on par-fives last year, so if I can clean up those, I'll have a chance to win.' As for those 77s, he said: 'It's not like I'm having a bad 18 holes. It's always just a bad nine holes that causes the damage and it's usually on a Friday, like last year. But I am better equipped now to handle it if things don't go right way. Mentally, I'm in a far better place.' McIlroy conceded that the circus surrounding Tiger Woods's return had not been unhelpful and the draw has worked out pretty well, too. The place you do not want to be come Thursday is in one of the last two groups, like Woods, but McIlroy has been treated kindly, with a mid-morning threesome alongside Americans Phil Mickelson and Ryan Moore. 'I don't think I've played alongside Phil at Augusta so that's perfect,' he said. 'We always get along well and he has a great record here. It will be fun to watch him.' It was this time last week, while practising in Florida, that McIlroy pronounced himself ready to go. 'It's been great not to have to think of anything technical while I'm playing,' he said. 'I've been able to enjoy the build-up.' Rory McIlroy waits with his caddie Fitzgerald in the rain during a practice round  at Augusta National Golf Club. Asked who he saw as favourite, McIlroy went for Bubba — ironic given a recent ESPN survey among the pros ranked Watson as the least favourite. 'I take it as I need to improve as a man,' said Watson, with the sort of annoying comment that explains his unpopularity in the first place. As for McIlroy, he knows where he needs to improve. 'You look at this course and it should fit me perfectly from tee to green,' he said. After One Direction on Wednesday, it'll be his turn to generate some roars.

Article: Forget Swansea, Stoke City and West Ham, the top seven would be seriously challenged by 'Team Pardew' should this manager have had a full season in charge at one club. That is after Crystal Palace, managed by Alan Pardew, beat Manchester City 2-1 at Selhurst Park on Monday night, the English manager's ninth win  in South London since leaving his role at Newcastle at the end of December. His former club have since plummeted in the Premier League while Palace now find themselves threatening the top half, and combining his records at both clubs this season would see 'Team Pardew' sit in eighth place, just five points behind Southampton. Alan Pardew could be a candidate for manager of the year with his record at Newcastle and Crystal Palace. The Premier League table with Team Pardew in - as well as a team complied from pre/post Pardew results. Newcastle fans were calling for Pardew's head for many years, seen as owner Mike Ashley's puppet, and were sitting in 10th place when the 53-year-old returned 'home' to Crystal Palace. The Eagles were in the relegation zone along with Burnley and Leicester City, struggling to pick up points following Neil Warnock's sacking. But while John Carver has picked up just nine points in his 12 games in charge at St James' Park, Pardew's Palace now have 39 points and are comfortably above the drop zone. A team compiled with Newcastle and Crystal Palace's stats pre/post Pardew would be sitting in 19th (albeit with 22 Premier League clubs now technically involved). A top-half finish is now the aim for Pardew and his men, as Toon supporters still fear relegation following a 1-0 derby defeat to Sunderland on Easter Sunday. Pardew celebrates with his Newcastle team and Moussa SIssoko after his goal against QPR in November. Newcastle fans hold a banner calling the removal of Pardew in a Premier League game at Stoke in September. John Carver's Toon side are not safe from relegation yet after a 1-0 defeat at the hands of Sunderland. It all started with a 4-0 win at Dover Athletic in the FA Cup and now Crystal Palace have won four in five, most recently beating the champions. His stock will continue to rise with this table, which would put him just six points adrift of Liverpool in fifth. Pardew has recently insisted he would perform at a top club, better than Monday's counterpart Manuel Pellegrini at least, while he is definitely a contender for Premier League Manager of the Year award. And nobody would have predicted that in 2014. Glenn Murray celebrates after netting the opening goal during Crystal Palace's victory over Manchester City.

Article: (CNN)Authorities identified and charged a man Monday in connection with the discovery of human remains in a duffel bag in Cambridge, Massachusetts, over the weekend. Carlos Colina, 32, was arraigned on charges of assault and battery causing serious bodily injury and improper disposal of a body, the Middlesex District Attorney's Office said in a statement. "This was a gruesome discovery," said District Attorney Marian Ryan. "Detectives are continuing to analyze evidence and awaiting information from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner so that we may determine if additional charges are warranted." Police were notified Saturday morning about a suspicious item along a walkway in Cambridge. Officers arrived at the scene, opened a duffel bag and found human remains. After that discovery, police say, a surveillance video led them to an apartment building, where more body parts were discovered in a common area. That location is near the Cambridge Police Department headquarters. The remains at both locations belonged to the same victim, identified Monday as Jonathan Camilien, 26. Camilien and Colina knew each other, according to authorities. The next scheduled hearing in the case is set for April 14. CNN's Andreas Preuss contributed to this report.

The French defender was limping heavily and clutching his hamstring after a clearance on the edge of his own penalty area before being withdrawn after just 28 minutes at Ewood Park. Sakho was replaced by Kolo Toure, who partnered Dejan Lovren in a threadbare four-man defence with Emre Can and Martin Skrtel already unavailable. Mamadou Sakho limped off early on in Liverpool's 1-0 FA Cup sixth round replay win over Blackburn Rovers. Frenchman was limping heavily and clutching his hamstring after a clearance on the edge of his penalty area. German midfielder-cum-defender Can was serving a one match ban for a red card against Arsenal on Sunday, while Skrtel still has one game left of his three-game suspension for stamping on Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea last month. Sakho will undergo scans on Thursday to determine the extent of the injury but he is already a doubt for Liverpool's Barclays Premier League clash with Newcastle United on Monday. Rodgers, who has tended to select three central defenders before the FA Cup replay, will be hoping the 25-year-old can return to action as soon as possible. Brendan Rodgers who has tended to select three central defenders, will be hoping for a quick recovery.

"Arrested Development" executive producer Brian Grazer said the show will return for a fifth season of 17 episodes. The Hollywood mogul was interviewed on Bill Simmons' podcast recently, and let it drop that fans can expect more of the quirky comedy. Netflix had no comment for CNN when asked to verify his statements. The fourth season was streamed exclusively on Netflix in 2013, after Fox canceled the show several years before. Despite critical acclaim, the series never had big ratings, but has a devoted fan base, who often quote from the show. It was not yet known if the full cast, including Jason Bateman, Michael Cera and Will Arnett, will return for the season.

Article: Liverpool vice-captain Jordan Henderson thinks his side could catch Manchester City in the Barclays Premier League having fought through a tough and long season at Anfield. Henderson and Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet both played their 47th game of season in the 2-0 win over Newcastle United on Monday night, equalling the record for appearances by any player in the top five European leagues so far this campaign. But the England midfielder believes that after finding winning form again following poor results against Manchester United and Arsenal, Liverpool can pile the pressure on to City who sit four points above them in the race for the Champions League. Liverpool vice-captain Jordan Henderson thinks his side could catch Manchester City in the  Premier League. Henderson played his 47th game of season in the 2-0 win over Newcastle United on Monday night. Manchester City have been faltering and lost 4-2 at Manchester United, Liverpool are four points behind. 'We knew it was an important game for us,' Henderson said 'Obviously the last couple of weeks in the Premier League have been disappointing both with performances and results. We knew today we needed to put that right and I think we did that with a great result for us. 'We've got ground to make up but we'll just keep going, keep winning in games and putting in performances. Come the end of the season, you never know.' Raheem Sterling pulled off some fine skill to open the scoring in the ninth minute at Anfield before Joe Allen capitalised on a defensive mistake to score his first Anfield goal with 20 minutes to go. Raheem Sterling pulled off some fine skill to open the scoring in the ninth minute at Anfield on Monday night.

'It wasn't my best game but I got the goal and helped the team. It was important after the defeats.' Newcastle had what looked a strong shout for a penalty when Dejan Lovren appeared to foul Ayoze Perez in the area, and Allen admitted he thought it was a spot-kick. 'I did get a good view of it as I'd missed the ball in the build-up,' he said. 'It look a good shout for a penalty, but I didn't get one the other night. These things happen.'

Article: (CNN)This is the end. Beautiful friend, the end. For the 1960s, the end arrived with -- depending on your ideals and your tribe -- either the Rolling Stones' Altamont fiasco in December 1969, the Kent State shootings in May 1970 or Richard Nixon's 1972 re-election. For "Mad Men," the "end of an era," as its slogan has it, begins Sunday. Over the past eight years, the show about a 1960s advertising agency and its collision with changing times has become part of the national fabric, if never a huge ratings hit. Stores have created fashion lines inspired by the show; there have been "Mad Men" cocktails and "Mad Men" museum exhibits and even "Mad Men" presidential references. Don Draper, the creative director played by Jon Hamm, has become a symbol of the times -- his and, sometimes, ours. Its subjects have taken the show to heart. In March, a "Mad Men" bench was unveiled in front of New York's Time & Life Building, where the fictional firm of Sterling Cooper & Partners has its headquarters. The end of a TV series brings with it some risk. "The Sopranos," "Mad Men" creator Matthew Weiner's former employer, divided fans with its famous cut-to-black finale. On the other hand, "Mad Men's" former AMC stablemate, "Breaking Bad," was saluted for an almost perfect landing. Speaking of landings: The last season -- technically, the first half of season 7 -- ended with the moon landing in July 1969. Though Weiner and his cast have been typically tight-lipped -- Weiner even hid the finale from his cast at first -- it's reasonable to assume the new season will pick up soon afterward. What's going to happen? Here are some educated guesses. With the '60s screaming towards their conclusion, "Mad Men" probably won't jump ahead much. The latter half of 1969 included the Manson murders, the Woodstock festival, a New York mayoral campaign and the Vietnam War moratorium demonstrations -- plenty of fodder for the characters to interact with, if only tangentially. Who knows? The show might even mention the Miracle Mets. It would be a nice way to acknowledge the agency's late Lane Pryce. Of course, Weiner might have a different idea; he's from Baltimore. "Mad Men" is generally a show about disintegration, reflective of the '60s themselves. The old orders are falling apart: white-shoe WASP firms like Sterling Cooper giving way to the ethnic pace-setters such as Doyle Dane Bernbach; grimy New York replaced by sunny Los Angeles; the "Good War" generation butting heads with the "Make Love, Not War" cohort; vacuum tubes and ledger books being displaced by a sleek, solid-state IBM world. It's all an ad agency can do to keep up. Last season saw plenty of intraoffice turmoil, thanks to the ill-fitting merger between Sterling Cooper and former rival Cutler Gleason and Chaough. Though the agency survived, it's now without Bert Cooper (Robert Morse) and under the ownership of (real-life) Madison Avenue titan McCann Erickson. That's not a recipe for long-term survival, and expect a number of longtime characters -- Ken Cosgrove (Aaron Staton), Harry Crane (Rich Sommer) and perhaps even Joan Harris (Christina Hendricks) -- to look for an exit. Roger Sterling -- the wisecracking executive played by John Slattery -- might find an exit as well, but not one he's anticipating. He's suffered two heart attacks. He drinks to excess. He's never grown up. Bet on a sudden and shocking departure. On the other hand, Peggy Olson's star has continued to rise (much like one of the character's models, advertising wunderkind Mary Wells Lawrence). She left Sterling Cooper once; indeed, she wouldn't have returned if her new agency hadn't merged with her old one. If Olson, played by Elisabeth Moss, bolts the firm, it will probably be to head her own agency -- and possibly get married. That is, if she's still interested in such an old-fashioned tradition. In recent seasons, Don's ex-wife, Betty (January Jones), has lost herself amid all the turmoil. She sees herself through the eyes of her spouses, and though husband Henry Francis (Christopher Stanley) has been far more supportive than Don, he's a busy man. And Sally, Don's daughter (Kiernan Shipka), is proving to be a handful. On the one hand, she's obviously bright; on the other, she's a teenager and starting to rebel. In recent seasons she's run away and started sneaking cigarettes, and she's always fighting with her mother. You could see her hitchhiking to Woodstock, or at least dropping out of school. Anything's possible, but given all that the character has been through -- divorces, affairs, office politics, morose late-night rides with Glen Bishop -- it's a bit on the nose, isn't it? Instead, try this: It's April 1, 1970. Richard Nixon is signing legislation banning cigarette ads on radio and television, reminding Don of the day 10 years earlier when he came up with the Lucky Strike campaign that began the series. No fool, he had seen this day coming years before. He'll fix himself a drink, ponder buying an avocado-colored refrigerator, clean out his ashtray and leave the show the way he arrived: on top of the zeitgeist, unable to accept his past and utterly, inscrutably alone.

Article: Kevin Pietersen is being urged to make the England selectors' lives difficult after his barnstorming start to the summer. England's exiled record run-scorer made 170 off 149 balls against MCC Universities Oxford at The Parks on Sunday, at the start of Surrey's three-day fixture. Former England captains Alec Stewart, Pietersen's boss as Surrey director of cricket, and Nasser Hussain have since both had their say on the 34-year-old's chances of a return to the Test arena. Kevin Pietersen in action for Surrey on day two of the three-day match against Oxford MCCU. Pietersen (centre) pictured with his Surrey team-mates at The Parks on Monday. Stewart is hoping Pietersen can further his quest when Surrey face Glamorgan in their first LV= County Championship fixture next week - while Hussain insists England's selectors need to clarify with a'very public decision' once and for all whether the controversial South Africa-born batsman has any prospects of playing for his adopted country again. Pietersen's impressive return to long-form cricket 14 months after his England sacking was timely, on the eve of the first Test against the West Indies which began 4,000 miles away in Antigua on Monday. Stewart said: 'Anyone who scores runs will ask questions of the selectors. 'Kevin shouldn't look any further than the next innings, whether it's here or down at Cardiff. 'If he strings hundreds together - and the reason we signed him is because we want him to score hundreds, double-hundreds, help us win games and be successful - it will be interesting to see where it may lead to. 'No one has got any idea whether Kevin Pietersen will play for England again. 'The only people that know that are those who are currently picking the England side. 'At the moment he's not being considered, because he hasn't played red ball cricket for the last 14 months.' Pietersen chills out against the fence as Oxford MCCU bat on Monday. Alec Stewart (right) believes that Pietersen could make it difficult for the England selectors. Hussain is impressed that Pietersen has already proved he is serious about a recall, and he is adamant the England and Wales Cricket Board must 'watch out' for him. 'He could easily go off and get his IPL contract and play over there,' Hussain said on Sky Sports 2. 'He's decided to give it another go... people say 'Oh, 170 against Oxford - it was only Oxford'. 'But as a player who has played 100 Test matches to turn up at The Parks and smash 170 shows how determined he is - so I'd watch out, if I was a selector.' Hussain senses Pietersen will not be easily deterred, unless England spell out that they do not want him. 'This is not a lad that's going to go away, and the ECB need to make a decision on Kevin Pietersen - make a very public decision on him, whether he is available for selection or not,' he said. 'I know the chairman elect, Colin Graves, has said that he is. 'But it needs to come from the selectors.' Pietersen believes last week's departure of Paul Downton - the ECB managing director who described him as 'disengaged' - has offered him an England 'lifeline' even as he approaches the veteran stage of his record-breaking career. Stewart, who played for England until the age of 40, added: 'Whether you're 18 or 38, if you're good enough, then I believe you take the age factor out of the occasion. 'If you're performing, surely you've got to be warranting a place in the team.' Pietersen made 170 runs off 149 balls during his stint with the bat in Oxford on Sunday. Pietersen fielding on Monday afternoon as the 34-year-old makes his county cricket return. He hopes Pietersen can boost Surrey's championship promotion prospects, and was encouraged by his comeback. 'It was a very good innings,' Stewart added. 'He had to get used to playing red ball cricket again - lining it up, letting it go - and then he showed what a quality batsman he is, which we all know but we just haven't seen it because he's only played 20-over cricket. 'We've signed Kevin because he's a top-class player. 'Will he play for England? We don't know. All we're going to do is enjoy having Kevin around, scoring as many runs as he can. 'Next game, next innings, is the next most important one.' Pietersen had a quieter second day back in his whites. He fielded at mid-off and slip as Surrey's hosts dug in after resuming on 28 for four. Jack McIver top-scored with 83, hitting 11 fours and a six, in the students' 224 all out. Chris Tremlett, another England Test player, took five for 30. Surrey reshuffled their batting order in the second innings, and Pietersen was left to watch on as they reached 182 for three - Zafar Ansari making 53 towards a lead of 378 entering Tuesday's final day.

"I always knew I wanted Elena's story to be a six season adventure, and within those six years I got the journey of a lifetime," she posted on her social media accounts after a "goodbye party" at Lake Lanier outside Atlanta, where the show is filmed. "I was a human, a vampire, a doppelganger, a crazy immortal, a doppelganger pretending to be human, a human pretending to be a doppelganger. I got kidnapped, killed, resurrected, tortured, cursed, body-snatched, was dead and undead, and there's still so much more to come before the season finale in May." And while that may be true, fans were feeling a little jilted. Many chastised the show's producers, some even Dobrev herself, for allowing the show to go on to a seventh season this fall after she departs. Many were upset that Dobrev's departure could sink hopes of seeing a satisfying denouement to the relationship between Dobrev's character, Elena Gilbert, and love interest vampire Damon Salvatore. Fans called the couple "Delena." "I feel angry, sad, depressed, numb but most of all I feel like part of me died along with Nina leaving TVD. Nothing will be the same again," Twitter user iDamonAndElena posted. Producer Julie Plec issued a statement supporting Dobrev's decision. "Nina is excited to spread her wings, get some rest, travel the world and also take it by storm, and we support her a thousand-fold," she said in the statement, according to media accounts. "We will miss Nina and the four hundred characters she played, but we look forward to the insane and exciting challenge of continuing to tell stories of our Salvatore Brothers and our much-loved and gifted ensemble." No thanks, some fans said. Dobrev seemed to anticipate the pain, urging fans to hold on through the show's finale next month. "If you think you know what's coming, you don't," she said.

Article: New Delhi, India (CNN)Police have arrested four employees of a popular Indian ethnic-wear chain after a minister spotted a security camera overlooking the changing room of one of its stores. Federal education minister Smriti Irani was visiting a FabIndia outlet in the tourist resort state of Goa on Friday when she discovered a surveillance camera pointed at the changing room, police said. Four employees of the store have been arrested, but its manager -- herself a woman -- was still at large Saturday, said Goa police superintendent Kartik Kashyap. State authorities launched their investigation right after Irani levied her accusation. They found an overhead camera that the minister had spotted and determined that it was indeed able to take photos of customers using the store's changing room, according to Kashyap. After the incident, authorities sealed off the store and summoned six top officials from FabIndia, he said. The arrested staff have been charged with voyeurism and breach of privacy, according to the police. If convicted, they could spend up to three years in jail, Kashyap said. Officials from FabIndia -- which sells ethnic garments, fabrics and other products -- are heading to Goa to work with investigators, according to the company. "FabIndia is deeply concerned and shocked at this allegation," the company said in a statement. "We are in the process of investigating this internally and will be cooperating fully with the police."

Article: A fortunate deflection from an audacious Nigel de Jong overhed kick saw AC Milan salvage a draw and frustrate European hopefuls Sampdoria at the San Siro on Sunday night. Former Samuel Eto'o provided the deft pass to nutmeg Philippe Mexes and find Roberto Soriano to open the scoring just before the hour mark with an emphatic finish from the top of the box. Milan were back level on 74 minutes when Nigel de Jong's spectacular effort which was headed straight for keeper Emiliano Viviano but found the back of the net off Alfred Duncan's leg. Nigel de Jong's spectacular overhead kick that levelled for AC Milan against Sampdoria on Sunday night. The Dutch midfielder attempted the audacious shot following a poor corner clearance at the San Siro. De Jong celebrates with Luca Antonelli after his strike took a massive deflection off Alfred Duncan's leg. AC Milan: D. Lopez; Abate (De Sciglio 71'), Paletta, Mexes, Antonelli; Van Ginkel, De Jong, Bonaventura; Cerci (Suso 62'), Destro (Pazzini (77'), Menez. Subs not used: Rami, Poli, Zapata, Bocchetti, Bonera, Abbiati, Alex, Mastalli, Donnarumma. Goal: De Jong. Sampdoria: Viviano; De Silvestri (Wszolek 88'), Silvestre, Romagnoli, Mesbah; Palombo, Obiang; Eder, Soriano (Duncan (66'), Eto'o; Okaka (Muriel 73') Subs not used: Correa, Bergessio, Munoz, Rizzo, Coda, Djordjevic, Acquah, Marchionni, Romero, Frison. Goal: Soriano. De Jong was lucky to be on the pitch after a late and dangerous sliding tackle went unpunished in the first half before he finally made it into the referee's book for leading with his elbow, an action that could have seen him sent off. With European involvement pretty much a pipe dream now for Filippo Inzaghi's side, who sit eighth seven points behind fifth-placed Fiorentina, the best they can hope for is to ruin the hopes of their rivals. Sampdoria could have moved ahead of Napoli in fourth into the first of the two Europa League qualification spots but are instead sixth in the Serie A behind Fiorentina on goal difference. They are eight points shy of third-placed Roma in the last of the Champions League places. A large section of supporters continued their protests against the club's management with banners reading 'Vendesi', meaning 'for sale', along with signs with names of star players who have been sold, and a #SaveACMilan message. Fans want owner Silvio Berlusconi to sell the club amid reports of interest from investors from China and Thailand. At least their side's improved on the field with a recent form turnaround. Sampdoria's Roberto Soriano drives his shot from the edge of the box for the opener against AC Milan. The i Blucerchiati players gather around Soriano as his impressive finish gives them the lead. Former Chelsea striker Samuel Eto'o gives a celebratory fist pump after his pass laid on the opening goal. Here Marco van Ginkel was dangerous from distance for Milan forcing Emiliano Viviano into action inside 15 minutes and was only just off target moments later. Destro, who left the field late in proceedings on a stretcher, headed a quality cross straight to Viviano on 30 minutes and did the same with a volley less than 10 minutes later. Alessio Cerci also squandered a chance from just outside the box over the crossbar. A different Sampdoria came out after the break and almost took the lead through Stefano Okaka and Eder, who was well saved by Diego Lopez at full stretch. AC Milan's supporters hold posters reading 'Vendesi' (meaning for sale) at the San Siro. Fans are growing increasingly disillusioned with those in charge of their club. A composed Eto'o orchestrated the deadlock breaker, taking the ample time he was gifted before threading his pass through the legs of fiery Mexes to a virtually lonesome Soriano just inside the box. The German-born Italian then casually slotted his shot to Lopez's right. But they couldn't hold onto the lead as De Jong's tried his luck to become the unlikely hero. And substitute Suso could have snatched the points late when his curling shot clattered into the post about fives minutes from the final whistle.

Article: (CNN)Nine British citizens were arrested in Turkey on Wednesday, suspected of trying to cross illegally into Syria, the Turkish military said on its website. The group included four children -- the oldest being 10 or 11, with the youngest born in 2013, a Turkish official told CNN on condition of anonymity. The nine were arrested at the Turkey-Syria border, the Turkish military said. It didn't say why the group allegedly was trying to get into Syria, which has been torn by a roughly four-year war between Syrian government forces and Islamist extremist groups and other rebels. Among the war's combatants is ISIS, which has taken over parts of Syria and Iraq for what it claims is its Islamic caliphate, and which is known to have been recruiting Westerners. Accompanying the children were three men and two women; all nine had British passports, the Turkish official said. UK police charge man with terror offenses after Turkey trip. The British Foreign Office said Wednesday that it is aware of reports of the arrests and that it is seeking information about the incident from Turkish authorities.

The 25-year-old is very much a key part of Manchester United's defence under Louis van Gaal and is quickly establishing himself as one of the best defenders in the country. Smalling, appeared to be enjoying a barbecue with some friends and his girlfriend Sam Cooke, as he posted his first photo captioned, 'BBQ Time #biggreenegg.'

Smalling, who missed the win over Aston Villa, could return for United as they look to cement their place in the Champions League. The 25-year-old is establishing himself as one of the best centre backs in England and continues to impress. His United team-mate Adnan Januzaj has also joined the social networking site and said: 'Hi Twitter! This is my official account looking forward to sharing with you all #MUFC #FirstTweet.' The winger has found game time under Louis van Gaal hard to come by and could choose to leave the club in the summer in search of first-team football. Januzaj burst onto the scene last season under David Moyes but struggles to fit into the Dutchman's style of play and has found himself on the fringes. Adnan Januzaj joined Twitter on Friday and just days before their crucial clash with Manchester City. The Belgian international has found his game time limited this season under new boss Louis van Gaal.

Article: (CNN)Kayahan, one of Turkey's best-loved singers and songwriters, died of cancer Friday at the age of 66. He had performed most recently in Istanbul on Valentine's Day. The performer, who was also an accomplished guitarist, was first diagnosed with cancer in 1990, the year he competed in the Eurovision Song Contest, and the year before he released the album that ignited his career. The cancer returned in 2005 and then again in 2014, Turkey's semiofficial Anadolu Agency reported. He died Friday in a hospital in Istanbul, five days after his 66th birthday. "We are in grief over losing Kayahan, who contributed to Turkish music with countless compositions and marked a generation with his songs," Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu tweeted. The singer, whose full name was Kayahan Acar, was born in Izmir province, in western Turkey on March 29, 1949. He grew up in Ankara, Turkey's capital, before moving to Istanbul. In 1990, he competed in the Eurovision Song Contest, finishing 17th. The following year he released an album titled "I Made a Vow," which catapulted him to prominence. Though he recorded nearly 20 albums, that one would remain his most popular. His final album was released in 2007. Other artists recorded his material throughout his career. Videos available online show a vibrant performer with a thick shock of dark hair as he accompanies himself on guitar and croons in a clear tenor. Kayahan was best known for his love songs. More recent videos show a  frailer performer, seated and without a guitar, but still clearly glorying in the joy of singing a song.

Article: Oxford women made history on Saturday with a 12th boat race victory in 16 years on a landmark day for the sport. For the first time in 88 years the women’s race was staged on the famous Tideway course that for so long had been the sole preserve of the men. Hot favourites Oxford romped to victory by six and a half lengths against Cambridge, as the women struck a telling blow for sporting equality in racing the same championship course on the same day as the men. Ansastaia Chitty lifts the trophy aloft after Oxford won the boat race, easing past Cambridge on the Thames. On the day the Oxford sides shared the race route for the first time, they also shared the exact same winning margin, with the men going on to triumph in their race shortly afterwards. Oxford women’s president Anastasia Chitty hailed the victory as a special moment for her crew, but also for rowing and sporting equality overall. ‘It’s an amazing moment,’ Chitty told BBC Sport. ‘To pull something off like that is amazing. ‘To row on the same stage as the men, there were so many women before us who have never had this opportunity and it’s extremely humbling. We started moving away early on and kept ourselves ahead.’ The Oxford crew celebrate their win over Cambridge after dominating the race from start to finish. As the most decorated Olympic athlete ever to race in either boat race, Oxford stroke Caryn Davies underlined the quality on display in the women’s contest. The 32-year-old US Olympics team star boasts silver at Athens and gold medals at Beijing and London in the women’s eight — and now a boat race victory to boot. ‘I think that’s harder, I’ve got to be honest,’ Davies told BBC Sport when asked how the boat race compared to Olympic competition. The Oxford women's crew power to their win in the first women's boat race on the river Thames. ‘There was almost three times as long to suffer. But there’s always less suffering when you win! I’m just proud and honoured to have such attention. It shows how excited people are and I’m so glad we can be role models to young women everywhere.’ Oxford women finished in 19 minutes 45 seconds — 19 seconds ahead of Cambridge. Davies added: ‘I could just hear so many people cheering along the banks and it didn’t matter it they were cheering for Oxford or Cambridge. Just that they turned out was really great for us.’ After Oxford’s women breezed to victory, their male counterparts made it a Dark Blue double with victory in the 161st men’s race by an identical six and a half lengths. President Constantine Louloudis claimed a fourth and final boat race victory, completing a clean sweep only interrupted by claiming bronze with Team GB’s men’s eight at London 2012. The dark blues made a fast start and dominated the race against their Cambridge counterparts. Louloudis hailed the victory — Oxford’s 11th in the last 15 years — and admitted he felt far more pressure than before, despite his three previous wins. ‘I felt much more pressure this year, especially as I was leaving the guys,’ Louloudis told BBC Sport. ‘There were some pretty dark moments going in but I’m so pleased for the guys. We just stuck to our plan and executed a great race. ‘This was a fantastic performance. It is a relief to win as we were firm favourites. ‘Rio remains the long-term goal but this race was so important for me and all of us.’ They were true to form, surging ahead from the start. Despite being quickly pegged back, they powered ahead during the middle section to dominate the race, finishing in 17 minutes 34 seconds — winning by 19 seconds as Oxford’s women had before them. Crew member Michael DiSanto added: ‘We knew what we needed to do and we wanted to go down as one of the best Oxford crews ever.’ Louloudis lauded the achievements of the women’s boat on such a landmark occasion. ‘This was an historic day and there is no reason not to be optimistic for the sport going forward,’ he said. The Cambridge crew kept going to the end but they were outclassed, eventually losing by over six lengths.

Oxford won their 12th women's boat race in 16 years. The Dark Blues triumphed by six and a half lengths. It was the first time the women's race has been raced over the same course and on the same day as the men's event.

Article: Beijing (CNN)China's state prosecutors on Friday formally charged the country's former security czar with accepting bribes, making him the highest-ranking Chinese Communist Party official ever to face corruption charges. Zhou Yongkang, 72, was also charged with abuse of power and leaking state secrets, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the highest prosecution authority in China, said. As a member of the ruling Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee -- China's top decision-making body -- Zhou was one of nine men who effectively ruled the country of more than 1.3 billion people. He retired in 2012. At the height of his power, Zhou controlled police forces, spy agencies, court systems as well as prosecution offices across China -- and wasn't shy in deploying his vast assets to crush dissent and unrest in the name of "preserving social stability." Now, prosecutors have accused Zhou of "taking advantage of his posts to seek benefits for others and illegally accepting huge amounts of money" during his long political career. His alleged actions have caused heavy losses to public assets and greatly harmed national interests, they added. Zhou was notified of his legal rights during the investigation and his lawyer's views were heard, according to a statement by the prosecutors. His case will be tried in Tianjin, a city near the Chinese capital, Beijing. The president of China's supreme court recently told reporters there would be "open" trials for accused former leaders like Zhou. However, the charge of leaking state secrets may allow authorities to shield certain legal proceedings from public view in Zhou's case. Zhou has not been seen in public since he attended an anniversary event at his alma mater in October 2013. He was expelled from the Communist Party and arrested last December. State media have painted an intricate web of officials, cronies and tycoons -- some with alleged mafia connections -- orbiting around Zhou before the crumbling of his power structure last summer. Zhou and his family members were said to have accumulated enormous wealth, in a blatant exchange between money and power. He was also found to have affairs with multiple women and allegedly traded power for sex, state-run Xinhua news agency reported last year. Analysts have viewed his shocking downfall as a watershed moment in the secretive world of Chinese politics, now ruled by President Xi Jinping. Xi has been spearheading a massive anti-corruption campaign,  targeting both "tigers" and "flies" --  high-ranking, and low-level, officials. Zhou is by far the biggest tiger caught in Xi's dragnet to date. "The important thing here is that Xi has proven he's powerful enough to break this taboo of never incriminating former Politburo Standing Committee members," longtime political analyst Willy Lam, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said last year, when the government revealed its formal investigation into Zhou. Many observers also note Zhou's patronage of Bo Xilai, a former Communist leader sentenced to life in prison for corruption in 2013. Bo's spectacular downfall the year before -- complete with tales of murder, bribery and betrayal -- attracted global attention. State media have cited his subsequent conviction as a prime example of Xi's resolve to clean up the party. The former Chongqing Communist Party chief's supporters, however, have long called him a political victim --  the former high-flying politician was once considered Xi's main challenger for the top spot of Chinese leadership. Political watchers see similarities between the Bo and Zhou cases. "The people being investigated for corruption are on the losing side of factional struggles," said Lam, who has predicted a suspended death sentence for Zhou.

Article: It's being billed as the Euro-derby in Madrid and depending on who you support the precedent is either last season's Champions League final or the six games that have been played between Real and Atletico since then. In Monday's pre-match press conference almost every question asked to Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti made reference to the fact that in six Madrid derbies this season Real are yet to win a single game – losing four and drawing two as Atletico have beaten them twice in the league and in the Spanish Super Cup and the Copa del Rey. But a remarkably relaxed Ancelotti, showing the kind of form in press room that he will hope his players show on the pitch Tuesday, reminded everyone that his team did not need to win. Two draws could see them go through so what was the problem? He said he didn't see Barcelona's slip on Saturday night against Sevilla because he was at the cinema 'enjoying a film' and when he was asked about Atletico Madrid's threat from set-pieces he responded: 'Don't forget we won the Champions League with a set-piece last season.' Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti says he is not obsessed with Atletico Madrid ahead of Tuesday's clash. Madrid-based papers Marca (left) and AS are looking ahead to the Champions League quarter-final first leg. Sergio Ramos (centre) scored an injury-time equaliser for Real as they beat Atletico 4-1 aet in the Champions League final last season at Benfica's Stadium of Light in Lisbon. However, Atletico are unbeaten in six Madrid derbies this term and dumped Real out of the Copa del Rey. His reference to Sergio Ramos' injury-time goal against Atletico Madrid in Lisbon that levelled Diego Godin's header and allowed Real to run in riot in extra-time will have struck a chord with Real supporters who in the build-up to the game have been busy reminding their rivals that while they may have won none of the last six meetings they did come out on top in the match that mattered more than any other. Real Madrid are at full strength for the game and that seems to have left Ancelotti as upbeat and confident as at any time so far this season. He toyed with his Spanish inquisitors when they questioned him about whether or not Gareth Bale would start the game. The Welshman was rested at the weekend but will be in the XI on Tuesday night. 'If Bale is not 100 percent fit he will not play because we have everyone available' said Ancelotti leaving a pregnant pause. But as the possibility that Spanish favourite Isco might start the game presented itself the Italian coach added: 'But he is 100 percent.' He added: 'Bale was fantastic last season but had been really good this season. He came good in the big finals scoring in the Champions League and Copa del Rey finals so let's see how he performs now in the final months of the season.' Gareth Bale (centre) is set to start for Real after being rested at the weekend against Eibar on Saturday. Like Ramos, Bale was also on target during Real's Champions League final success over Atletico last season. The feeling among Real Madrid's coaching staff is that while Bale has been criticised by the Madrid press for not being the team player that Isco is, his ability to win a big final with a goal or an assist is unmatchable. Anelotti added: 'I am not obsessed with Atletico Madrid,' mentioning 'attitude' several times in his positive discourse and admitting that was the key missing ingredient from Real Madrid's 4-0 defeat to Atletico in February. He said facing Simeone was 'honour and a problem' and picked out Atletico Madrid's resilience when asked what their greatest quality was. 'They fight from the first minute to the last,' he said. Atletico Madrid fans believe that fight will see them overcome Real Madrid for the seventh time this season and the Vicente Calderon will be full for what, with their title hopes now gone, is their game of the season. Real's swagger has been rediscovered though, wth the return of key players Sergio Ramos, James Rodriguez and Luka Modric. Ancelotti recalled the moment Modric' corner was headed in by Ramos in Lisbon. 'It's a wonderful memory,' he said. 'Now we have the challenge of going for Real Madrid's 11th European Cup. Real know they face a stern test against an Atletico side that beat them 4-0 when they last met in February. Ancelotti hails pitting his wits against Atletico boss Diego Simeone as an 'honour and a problem' The return of midfielder Luka Modric (centre) from injury has revitalised Real in recent weeks.

Atletico Madrid host Real Madrid in their Champions League quarter-final first leg at the Vicente Calderon on Tuesday night. Real beat Atletico 4-1 aet in the Champions League final  last season. Atletico are unbeaten in six Madrid derbies this season against their rivals.

Article: (CNN)"Sell all that you own and distribute the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me," Jesus tells the rich man in one of his best-known parables. It was a mantra he invoked repeatedly: the poor were blessed, and it was easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than it was for the well-to-do to enter paradise.  Meanwhile, Jesus told his Twelve Apostles to leave their day jobs and follow him on an itinerant mission with few prospects of success and no visible means of support. So how did this wandering band of  first-century evangelists support themselves? Clearly, money was a concern, and not just as an impediment to salvation. In the New Testament, money gets 37 mentions, while "gold" gets 38 citations, "silver" merits 20, and "copper" four. "Coin" comes up eight times, and "purse" and "denarii" -- the Roman currency -- get half a dozen mentions each for a total of 119 currency referrals. Perhaps the most relevant reference is also one of the most charged passages in the New Testament:. As the Gospel of John tells it, six days before Passover, Jesus was in Bethany at the house of his friend Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. A woman named Mary takes a jar of costly perfumed oil and anoints the feet of the reclining Jesus. She dries his feet with her hair, an irresistible image for artists and dramatists. Judas Iscariot objected to the act. "Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor?" Judas asks. Though 300 denarii was the annual wage of a laborer, Jesus told Judas to leave her alone, and foreshadowing his fate, said the anointing would be useful for his burial, and besides, "you always have the poor with you" -- but Jesus would not always be there. What that passage makes clear is that the Jesus community had a common purse because they needed money to survive. So how much? "I imagine the ministry functioned at a subsistence level," Rabbi Joshua Garroway, a professor of Early Christianity and the Second Commonwealth at Hebrew Union College in Los Angeles. Jesus and his disciples walked, wore what they had, slept outside or in stayed in friends' homes. They ate what they caught or what others shared. "I venture to guess that begging and hospitality will have sufficed to meet the basic needs of Jesus and the companions with whom he traveled," Garroway said. Garroway said that it was possible, even likely, that Jesus and his followers received donations from supporters, and possibly substantial ones from some of the rich people who were drawn to his ministry despite -- or perhaps because of -- his preaching on the perils of wealth. The Gospel of Luke gives us a glimpse of how Jesus' ministry functioned on a practical level:. "Soon afterwards he went on through cities and villages, proclaiming and bringing the good news of the kingdom of God. The twelve were with him, as well as some women who had been cured of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary, called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out,  and Joanna, the wife of Herod's steward Chuza, and Susanna, and many others, who provided for them  out of their resources." So, according to Luke, women whom Jesus had healed in turn provided for him out of their "resources," with Mary Magdalene and Joanna capturing our attention -- one by virtue of her husband, and the other, by her stature in the story of Jesus. Joanna was an upper-class woman married to a man who was intelligent and capable enough to manage the complicated household of Herod Antipas, the son of Herod the Great, the violent and ambitious head of Judea. As part of this volatile but powerful household, Joanna would be uniquely positioned to help Jesus with her resources, being both wealthy and having palace connections. She attends to him during his life, and, the Gospels tell us, after his death, as one of the trio of women who go to his tomb and find it empty. With her on that morning is Mary Magdalene, also identified as -- among other things -- a financial supporter of Jesus. Mary likely came from the prosperous town of Magdala, on the Sea of Galilee. As home to a thriving fishing industry, as well as dye and textile works, Mary could well have come from an affluent family -- or have been a successful business woman herself. Mary Magdalene was free to travel the country with Jesus and his disciples, so was unlikely to have a husband and children waiting for her at home, and in "Finding Jesus" we examine the Gnostic gospel of Mary Magdalene and explore the argument that Jesus was, in fact, her husband. She may have simply been an independent woman with her own resources who found a compelling message, and messenger. Not only was Mary Magdalene one of Jesus' most devoted followers, who stuck with him all the way from Galilee to Jerusalem, from the ministry to the cross and the tomb, but also she provided for him from her own means, said Mark Goodacre, a professor of New Testament and Christian Origins at Duke University. When the Gospels speak of her "ministering" to Jesus, they are explaining that she was one of the key figures in Jesus' everyday mission, Goodacre continues. Along with other women like Joanna and Susanna, she was one of those who made his mission viable. Along with these women, men like Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus, both men of stature and wealth, may have chipped in to help fund Jesus' ministry. The Gospels reveal that both these men were rich, and supported Jesus -- indeed, it was Joseph who removed Jesus from the cross on Good Friday, anointing his body with the help of Nicodemus, and placing him in the tomb that Joseph had reserved for himself. After the resurrection on that first Easter Sunday, the movement Jesus started grew exponentially, and the church's relationship to money grew more complicated as the needs became greater. Michael McKinley is co-author, with David Gibson, of "Finding Jesus: Faith. Fact. Forgery.: Six Holy Objects That Tell the Remarkable Story of the Gospels."

Article: Andy Lee will leave New York with his head held high and a burgeoning reputation firmly intact. A dramatic, frenetic 12 rounds here saw the Irishman sent sprawling in the very first against the dangerous Peter Quillin, the man who vacated the WBO middleweight title Lee won so gloriously in Las Vegas last December before the result was deemed a draw. It was the first time the reigning champion had gone the distance. No mean feat considering he fought for a lengthy period with a strained biceps muscle in his left arm. Peter Quillin (left) and Andy Lee stand with the referee after the judges declared their bout a draw. The two fighters embrace following their exciting 12-round contest in Brooklyn on Saturday night. Lee retains his WBO belt after Quillin failed to make the required 160lbs weight on Friday. Quillin's unbeaten record remains intact following the tie though he threw fewer punches than Lee. The two fighters congratulate each other at the end of the 12 rounds, which were judged to be a draw. With Quillin dramatically failing to make the required weight of 160lbs on Friday, Lee strode out in front of a healthy crowd knowing whatever happens, his belt wasn't going anywhere. Yet this was still one hell of a contest and when the judges correctly called it a tie, no-one was really arguing. While it was scored 113-112, 112-113, 113-113, the statistics told a different story. Lee threw more punches (299-267) and connected with greater frequency (113-103). It was a warrior-like display. Not maybe enough to have destroyed Quillin's unbeaten record, but impressively solid and energetic. Lee, however, was hard on himself. 'It was a tough fight, he dropped me at the start because I was lazy,'he said. 'I had the momentum late on. I understand with two knockdowns people may have thought he won but I could have done better.' Billy Joe Saunders is the mandatory challenger and looks the likeliest next opponent. Another meeting with Quillin, although intriguing with the title on the line, is highly unlikely. Lee was knocked to the canvas by Quillin during the very first round of the contest in New York. Lee admitted he had been 'lazy' in the early stages of the fight, leading to his knockdown and standing count. Quillin is ordered to the corner after Lee falls later in the bout. 'If my next fight is Quillin it should be in Ireland. He has an Irish surname. Maybe he has some ancestors there,' smiled Lee, who will now look forward to a few weeks off to recharge the batteries before making his next move. Only the American will know how, even though he last fought a year ago, his team somehow allowed their man to miss the weight so spectacularly. The 31-year-old was over by almost a pound-and-a-half. Trainer Adam Booth thought he looked over the limit in the build-up. Lee would never display such a lack of professionalism. The 30-year-old in the form and shape of his life. Title fight or not, this was the Irishman's chance to show he belongs at boxing's top table. A polished display was the order of the evening to ensure his rapier-like trajectory continues this year. Quillin insisted before the clash it would be like a chess match. He was right, yet playing with Kings or Queens don't often lead to the explosion of power which sent Lee spiralling to the canvas at the end of the first round. Quillin's right connects with Lee's right shoulder during the Middleweight bout. Lee and Quillin exchange punches at close quarters during the tight contest. Lee is put onto the pack foot as Quillin lines up a punch with his right. Quillin's right hook rocked the Irishman who was given a standing count. It was just the second time he'd hit the floor, taking in both his amateur and professional career. No wonder Lee looked dazed. The American was quickly showing why he's the proud owner of an unblemished record. A razor-sharp combination had Lee reeling again but the Limerick man is a true warrior. A far better third saw Quillin on the backfoot for the first time as, after such a frenetic start, everything began to calm somewhat. Lee went down again and although it was originally scored as a knockdown it later emerged Quillin had stepped on his foot. If the scorecard had taken that into account, a draw could well have turned into an Irish win. Nevertheless, Lee needed some respite. The Brooklyn crowd unleashed some booing to display their displeasure at both fighters standing their ground. Yet the Irishman, who won his last two fights by coming from behind to land the killer blow, wouldn't have care a jot. Heading into the sixth, Quillin was ahead in the eyes of the judges. Lee, the master of coming from behind to snatch victory, needed something special. Quillin connects with Lee's cheek with a crunching right. Quillin again makes contact but over the course of the whole fight, he landed fewer punches. The comeback came at the end of the seventh, a crunching right leaving a very open Quillin tumbling. It was the first time he'd been down in his career. Lee, though, needed more heading into the tenth. The final rounds were dramatic without ever really looking terminal for either fighter. And when the last bell rang, Lee and the amiable Quillin hugged and showed a deep admiration towards each other which has been evident all week. 'The judges see it their way and I respect the decision,'said the American. 'There is a first time for everything, I got knocked down and thankfully I got up. There is no perfect story, I come from nothing so to have something is a blessing as is going home to a family I love. 'Respect to Andy Lee though.'

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence.
Judges scored the contest 113-112, 112-113, 113-113 - a tie. Irishman Lee was floored in the first round but fought back admirably. He threw more punches and connected more regularly than his opponent. Quillin had failed to make the required weight of 160lbs on Friday. Reigning WBO middleweight champion Lee went distance for first time. And he did most of it with a strained biceps muscle in his left arm.

Article: Porto have nothing to prove coming into their quarter-final first leg against Bayern Munich as the only undefeated side in the Champions League. However Julen Lopetegui has warned his side has plenty of room to improve saying the team 'hasn't stopped growing'. When Lopetegui comes up against his former Barcelona team-mate Pep Guardiola, who the former goalkeeper labels  'a winner', at Dragao on Wednesday night, it will be a clash of the two most prolific scoring sides of the tournament so far. 'We come into this tie being able to enjoy what we have accomplished and aiming to give our best in both games, as we always do,' Lopetegui told Goal.com. Porto train ahead of their Wednesday clash against Bayern Munich in their Champions League quarter-finalo. Julen Lopetegui says Porto come into the match able to enjoy their achievement of being undefeated. Lopetegui exits the Dragao tunnel with its Champions League branding in place and ready for Bayern. With a number of new players in the summer still meshing with the squad Porto have room for improvement. 'Many new players arrived last summer, but we have our idea of playing and the team has worked very well since the beginning of the season. 'We started this project with great enthusiasm and the purpose of qualifying the team for the Champions League [from the playoffs]. From there, the team hasn't stopped growing - travelling on its own path.' Porto were clinical in their last Champions League start breezing past Basle 4-0 to claim the last-16 tie 5-1 on aggregate, while Bayern demolished Shakhtar Donetsk 7-0 after a 0-0 first leg.

Atletico Madrid, Monaco and Bayern are the only sides to have been more frugal. Guardiola, a two-time Champions League winner with Barcelona and Super Cup winner with Bayern, showed his former fellow Spain squad member plenty of respect ahead of the match. 'It is an honour for me and I congratulate him already for Porto's great performances,' he said in Tuesday's press conference on Tuesday. 'Porto haven't lost a game in the Champions League this season and I'm happy to be facing Lopetegui.'

Article: (CNN)When I was elected to the Kentucky State Senate in 1967, I became the first woman and the first person of color to serve in the body.  Five decades later, I find it almost unfathomable that a politician from my own state is attempting to launch his presidential campaign on a record that includes questioning landmark voting rights and civil rights legislation. But that is what Rand Paul, who today declared he's running for president of the United States, is doing. His campaign team told reporters last week that his campaign announcement message would be about "expanding the Republican Party" -- a message of inclusion. But those of us listening today who he is hoping to include, heard nothing more than hype. I'm not buying it. Since coming to the U.S. Senate, Paul has tried to sell himself as a different type of Republican.  He's tried to brand himself as the GOP's minority outreach candidate.  The problem for Paul, and the GOP at large, is that they don't back up their words with their policies. Yes, it's about time that Republicans started seriously considering the fact that black voters are an important piece of the electoral puzzle.  But they can't actually appeal to the community unless they have a real commitment to the issues facing minority communities.  A quick survey of Sen. Paul's positions makes clear that he does not. Paul kicked off his announcement speech in Louisville by declaring "I have a message that is loud and clear:  We have come to take our country back."  I have no doubt that under Paul's leadership, he would indeed take our country back -- in the wrong direction -- way back to a time when we were debating the Civil Rights Act --  which Paul has done since landing on the national stage; when there was no Department of Education -- a department he thinks "should be done away with;" when women didn't have choices -- choices Paul seeks to limit in Washington; when DREAMers weren't protected from deportation -- protections Paul currently opposes. In his inept speaking engagements at historically black colleges and universities, he has come across as condescending and lacking basic cultural competency. But Paul has also questioned the Civil Rights Act, and even claimed that private business owners have a right to discriminate. When asked about the need for a more robust Voting Rights Act following the Supreme Court's dismantling of the law, Paul dismissively remarked, "We have an African-American President." When President Obama stood with John Lewis and other veterans of the civil rights movement in front of the Edmund Pettus Bridge last month to mark the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, he inspired us all by saying: "With effort, we can roll back poverty and the roadblocks to opportunity.... With effort, we can protect the foundation stone of our democracy for which so many marched across this bridge -- and that is the right to vote." America is better -- and we solve more problems -- with more democracy, not less.  Unfortunately Rand Paul has demonstrated that he disagree with that basic principle.  Paul tried once again from that stage in Louisville to fashion himself as the one member of his party courageous enough to try to broaden Republican appeal to constituencies they ignore year after year. But his record makes it very clear that his views are outdated, outside of the mainstream, and disqualifying for a man who wants to lead our country. The American people deserve a leader who won't disrespect their intelligence, who won't pander to them when it's convenient, and who won't work to dismantle the progress we have made over the last five decades. What I heard today, didn't change the facts about Rand Paul's record.  The American people deserve better than Rand Paul.

Phil Burgess, Charlie Hayter and Tom Mitchell scored the tries in the final for the English, who bounced back from a thumping group stage defeat to Fiji on Saturday to win a first title since the Wellington Sevens in Feb. 2013.

New Zealand, winners of 12 of the 15 Sevens World Series titles and reigning World Cup sevens champions, endured a disappointing week in the Japanese capital, suffering a first ever loss to Canada in the quarter-finals. The 19-15 defeat sent them into the second tier Plate tournament, which they won after beating France in the last four and then Scotland in the final after Dylan Collier's try in the last play of the game.

Article: (CNN)A French-language global television network regained control of one of its 11 channels Thursday after a cyberattack a day earlier crippled its broadcasts and social media accounts. Television network TV5Monde was gradually regaining control of its channels and social media outlets after suffering what the network's director called an "extremely powerful cyberattack." In addition to its 11 channels, TV5Monde lost control of its social media outlets and its websites, director Yves Bigot said in a video message posted later on Facebook. On a mobile site, which was still active, the network said it was "hacked by an Islamist group." ISIS logos and markings appeared on  TV5Monde social media accounts. But there was no immediate claim of responsibility by ISIS or any other group. As day broke Thursday in Europe, the network had regained the use of one of its 11 channels and its Facebook page, Paul Germain, the chain's editor in chief, told BFMTV, a CNN affiliate in France. However, by late morning, a number of pages on the network's website had messages saying they were under maintenance. The outage began around 8:45 p.m. Paris time (2:45 p.m. ET) on Wednesday. TV5Monde offers round-the-clock entertainment and news programming that reaches 260 million homes worldwide, according to the Ministry of Culture and Communications. It functions under a partnership among the governments of France, Canada and Switzerland, as well as the Wallonia-Brussels Federation. Other networks that provide content to TV5Monde include CNN affiliates France 2 and France 3, France 24 and Radio France International.

Article: Jolyon Palmer is determined to claim a place in Formula One next year after being given the perfect opportunity by Lotus to prove himself worthy. For the first time the Enstone-based marque are providing their test and reserve driver with a number of outings in Friday's first practice session ahead of grand prix weekends. Ordinarily in the past, Lotus' reserve has been nothing more than a spare part, stood on the sidelines whilst the race drivers completed their tasks. Jolyon Palmer will drive in every Friday practice session for Lotus this season. This year, however, Lotus have decided Palmer will get a shot, and not just as a driver doing all the donkey work too. Every Friday Palmer will be behind the wheel - as was the case in China last week and again in Bahrain this week - his run-plan will be similar to that of whoever he replaces. In China, Palmer was only 0.6secs behind Pastor Maldonado at the end of FP1, a tremendous effort given it was Palmer's first major outing at an F1 event. If Palmer can continue to push, or even on occasion better the times of Maldonado and team-mate Romain Grosjean, doors may open. 'I want to be really pushing the race drivers. That's the aim,' said Palmer. 'I'm pretty much running on the same run plan as those guys. It's not like we've seen in FP1 sessions before with other drivers where they have been on quali settings, engine turned up or low fuel. 'This year there's a direct comparison and I want to show why I should be racing next year.' Unfortunately for last year's GP2 champion, his lack of competitive work outside of his duties with Lotus may prove a hindrance. Palmer drives  during practice for the Chinese Grand Prix last weekend. The 24-year-old from Horsham would love to be keeping his hand in, but knows it is something he has to sacrifice to keep his F1 dream alive. 'I want to race, but only if I get the right offer,' added Palmer, son of former F1 driver Jonathan. 'If I get a good offer to do something that would be a good career move for me then I'd like to race. 'It's about keeping sharp. It's the one thing I'm missing this year. 'I'm loving working with Lotus and being in F1, but I'd love to be racing as well, so if I get a good offer I'd love to.' Palmer, though, is not actively seeking further employment because of his commitment to Lotus, adding: 'My main focus is all here and I'm really busy anyway. 'If something came my way then I would definitely consider it, but my main priority is Lotus and I will not compromise anything I do here by racing elsewhere. 'But if there is something that came along that could fit in with this then I'd be happy to do it.'

Article: Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (CNN)Lost luggage after a long flight is a common, frustrating occurrence of modern air travel. And sometimes, airlines lose things that are irreplaceable. American Jennifer Stewart says she was devastated to learn that Etihad Airways lost her most important baggage following a recent trip from Abu Dhabi to New York City: her 2-year-old pet cat, Felix. Stewart said that she and her husband, Joseph Naaman, booked Felix on their Etihad Airways flight from the United Arab Emirates to New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport on April 1. Shortly after the plane arrived in New York that evening, Felix went missing somewhere on the grounds of Kennedy Airport, according to Etihad Airways. Felix was able to get loose, Stewart said she believes, because the cat's plastic carrier was badly damaged at some point either during the flight or the transfer from the airplane to the pickup area. Stewart said a cargo manager called the couple to an office after they landed at Kennedy last week and notified them that their cat's carrier had been crushed. Photographs taken by Stewart showed a large hole in the top of the cat's carrier. At least one of the corners of the case appeared partially collapsed. Nearly one week later, Felix remains missing. "For them to take a cat and ship him like he was cargo, not a live animal, makes me sick," Stewart said.  "You trust that people care and are doing the job well, and then this happens." A representative for Etihad Airways told CNN that that the loss of pets during air travel is "extremely rare."  The airline shipped more than 200 pets last year. Etihad Airways is investigating the incident and is working with ground handlers at the New York airport to help locate the missing cat. The Abu Dhabi-based carrier also said it hired "third-party specialists" to help in the hunt for Felix. "We deeply regret this unfortunate incident and are keeping the owner apprised of the progress of the search," Etihad Airways told CNN in a statement. "We will review our pet handling procedures in the wake of this incident, as the safety and care of pets traveling with Etihad Airways is a top priority." Stewart and her husband booked the cat's flight as part of their job relocation to the United States after living in Abu Dhabi for more than three years. The couple said they spent $1,200 to ship Felix on the 14-hour flight. "You pay all of this money, but for what? People assume you pay extra to have your pets taken care of, but they're treated no differently than a free piece of checked luggage," Stewart said. It isn't the first time a pet has gone missing at New York's busiest airport. In August 2011, a cat escaped from its carrier before an American Airlines flight from New York to San Francisco. That cat was eventually discovered -- alive -- two months later in a customs room at the airport. But the cat later had to be euthanized because of injuries and malnutrition it suffered while lost. This weekend, Stewart enlisted the help of a local nonprofit, which provided a highly trained detection dog, to help track down Felix's scent. A wildlife biologist who works with the airport has also placed traps to facilitate Felix's safe return, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Officials at Kennedy have offered to assist Etihad Airways as the airline investigates what happened, the Port Authority said. Stewart said the couple will continue to search the airport until they have answers. "We just want to find Felix. But I just don't know if we will," she said.

Article: Barcelona's Brazilian star Neymar was left fuming after being substituted by Luis Enrique during the 2-2 draw at Sevilla on Saturday night, according to reports in Spain. Neymar, who scored his side's second goal with a curling free kick, was replaced with the score at 2-1 and 15 minutes to play. Sevilla then scored a late equaliser, and Neymar 'can't understand why he is subbed so much' reports Spanish paper Sport. Neymar's dispute with Luis Enrique features prominently in Spain, while they look ahead to the Madrid derby. The paper points out that the forward has been replaced in 15 of his 34 matches this season, with only Ivan Rakitic and Andres Iniesta being substituted more. With Barcelona still top of La Liga, and challenging for a treble, the paper points out that the club will need to be united in the final run-in. Elsewhere in Spain the attention is focused on the Madrid derby in this week's Champions League quarter-finals. Marca claims that the game is 'like a final', with the two teams playing out a repeat of last year's showdown in Lisbon, while in AS, Real defender Pepe calls for intensity and humility.

Article: (CNN)The nation's top stories will be unfolding Tuesday in courthouses and political arenas across the country. Massachusetts is hosting two of the highest-profile court trials in recent memory -- those of former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez and Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Both lengthy trials are coming to a close. In Louisville, Kentucky, Sen. Rand Paul made the not-so-surprising announcement that he will run for president, while in Chicago, voters will head to the polls in a very surprising runoff between Mayor Rahm Emanuel and challenger Jesus "Chuy" Garcia. And in Ferguson, Missouri, the shadow of Michael Brown and the protests over his shooting by Officer Darren Wilson will loom large over the city's elections. Here's a breakdown of what to expect today and how we got here:. Tsarnaev, who's accused of detonating a bomb at the 2013 Boston Marathon along with his now-deceased brother, faces the stiffest of penalties -- life in prison or the death penalty -- if he's found guilty on any of 17 capital counts against him, including setting off weapons of mass destruction at a public event as an act of terrorism. The 13th juror: What defense? On Monday, survivors and victims' families wept and Tsarnaev fidgeted at a defense table as jurors heard a prosecutor allege that the 21-year-old "brought terrorism into the backyards and main streets." The jury on Tuesday morning began what is expected to be a lengthy deliberation process on 30 total charges, before the so-called penalty phase, should he be found guilty on any counts. It took prosecutors months to present 131 witnesses to support their claim that Hernandez killed semi-pro player Odin Lloyd, yet on Monday, Hernandez's defense team wrapped up its witnesses in less than a day. Closing arguments are scheduled for Tuesday, and the jury will begin deliberations soon thereafter. Jurors in Fall River, Massachusetts, will be asked to decide if Hernandez is culpable in the shooting death of Lloyd, whose body was found in a Massachusetts industrial park in the summer of 2013. Much of the evidence against Hernandez is circumstantial, and among the facts the jury will be asked to take into consideration are New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft's testimony, the testimony of Hernandez's fiancee, some grainy footage from Hernandez's home security system and a footprint left by a Nike Air Jordan shoe. Hernandez known for swagger, even in court. OK, sure, no one was floored when the Kentucky senator announced his bid for the Oval Office, but of course it was news when he made it official Tuesday. Paul is expected to hit the campaign trail visiting the all-important early voters in New Hampshire, South Carolina, Iowa and Nevada. The physician rode a wave of tea party popularity into the Senate in 2010, where he carefully built a brand of mainstream libertarianism, and he is banking on a coalition of younger voters and traditional Republicans to usher him into the White House. Paul and Sen. Ted Cruz are the only declared candidates for the GOP nomination, though the field will certainly grow and could include the likes of Florida's Jeb Bush, New Jersey's Chris Christie, Wisconsin's Scott Walker, South Carolina's Lindsey Graham and Florida's Marco Rubio. Would Rand be here without Ron? It's the Windy City's first runoff for a citywide office, and it's being billed as a battle for the "future of Chicago." In one corner, you have Emanuel, President Barack Obama's notoriously hard-charging former chief of staff, and in the other, you have Jesus "Chuy" Garcia, a county commissioner who has come to embody populist and liberal Democrats' frustrations with the Chicago incumbent. After Emanuel failed to snare half the vote in February's general election, he will go head-to-head with Garcia. The timing is interesting, too, as Easter, Passover and spring break appear to have spurred more than 142,000 early votes, up from about 90,000 before the first round of voting in February. Following Michael Brown's death, the national spotlight shone on Ferguson, particularly how the city's predominantly black population is woefully underrepresented in its police force and City Council. Yet with all the hubbub about the face of civic leadership, only four in 10 city residents hit the polls in November to cast ballots. Residents speak out ahead of vote. Tuesday's election will bring change, no matter how the ballots are cast: Two black men are running for one of the open seats, and the current lone black council member isn't up for re-election. In another ward, two black women and two white men are vying for an open seat. And a white protester is running for a third post.

Article: Dundee have vowed to stand by Paul McGowan after the bad boy midfielder was spared jail for a third assault on a policeman. But the Dens Park bad boy will miss two forthcoming games against former club Celtic because he is under house arrest. The 27-year-old has been placed on a 16-week restriction of liberty order which confines him to home between the hours of 7pm and 7am. And the Dark Blues face Ronny Deila's night next Wednesday night – before a Friday night trip to Parkhead on May 1. McGowan was handed his third conviction for assaulting a police officer at Airdrie Sheriff Court. As a St Mirren player he was sentenced to 130 hours of unpaid work and handed a one-year supervision order in January 2014 after admitting kicking two officers. The court heard McGowan 'charged towards' two police officers after a disturbance in Airdrie in the early hours of November 23 last year. He later kicked another officer on the body while being detained at Coatbridge police station. Paul McGowan avoided a prison sentence after a third assault on a policeman. Sheriff Derek O'Carroll spared the Dens star a prison sentence after hearing he had was undergoing counselling through PFA Scotland, the players' union, for a gambling problem in addition to social work sessions. In a statement Dundee vowed to support their player through his problems saying: 'The club does not condone the behaviour which has led to this and wouldn't from any member of our staff. 'We fully respect the decision made by the court and Dundee FC will be standing by the player. 'Paul is an integral part of the club and we will be working alongside the PFA with him as he bids to positively resolve his off the field issues. 'With the support of his manager, his teammates and club staff we hope Paul will be able to move forward and be part of another successful season next year at Dens Park. 'The club will be making no further comment on the matter.' His solicitor, Liam O'Donnell, told the court that social work reports 'finally give some indication that the accused is getting it in terms of his offending. He added: 'He was not in any trouble from the age of 16 to 23. At age 23 he separated from his partner. The reason he separated has been attributed to an underlying gambling problem. The 27-year-old Dundee midfielder pictured in action against Dundee United last week. 'This gambling problem seems to be the root of his offending. When he takes alcohol his anger about the gambling problem seems to come out through aggression.' O'Donnell revealed the former St Mirren player was undergoing voluntary counselling each week through the Paisley-based RCA Trust, which helps people with alcohol and gambling addictions. 'He is fully supported by his club,' he added. 'The managing director of Dundee Football Club is present in court to indicate his support because he is addressing matters.' After listening to the address, Sheriff O'Carroll reminded McGowan of the previous occasions he had been convicted of offences, in 2010 and 2013. 'And here you are again facing similar charges,' O'Carroll added. 'It's quite correct to say that you are on the cusp of custody and certainly that's in the thoughts of the court.' However, he proceeded to sentence McGowan to the tagging order provided he continues with the counselling. 'If you breach the order you will be brought back here and I have already advised you what the outcome will be,' the sheriff added. Dundee managing director John Nelms, who was accompanied in court by players including captain James McPake, declined to answer questions outside court. McGowan also declined to comment but O'Donnell said afterwards: 'He is relieved with the outcome and he knows he needs to modify his behaviour. He appreciates the support of his club and others.'

Article: (CNN)A mammoth fire broke out Friday morning in a Kentucky industrial park, sending plumes of thick smoke over the area as authorities worked to contain the damage. The blaze began shortly before 7 a.m. at the General Electric Appliance Park in Louisville, according to Mike Weimer from the city's emergency management agency. He said that there were no reports of anyone injured or trapped. Video showed both smoke and bright orange flames. Firefighters took up positions around the affected buildings, spraying water from the periphery. Weimer told CNN that authorities didn't know what had caused the fire, which had gone to at least four alarms. According to a GE website, its facility in the Louisville Appliance Park is "revitalizing manufacturing in the United States." The park is large, such that 34 football fields could fit in one of its warehouses in the facility.

Article: Cedar Falls, Iowa (CNN)As aides politely tried to rush Ted Cruz from an event in Cedar Falls to one in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on Thursday, the presidential candidate continued shaking hands with anyone who wanted to meet him. Finally, after the selfies and conversations started to die down, his aides managed to move him closer to the door when a tall, burly man stopped him. "Senator," he said, "can I pray with you real quick?" "Yeah," Cruz said, as he clasped the man's upper arm and the two bowed their heads. It was one of the many moments when Cruz connected with voters on a religious level last week, as the senator from Texas hit the trail in Iowa for the first time as a presidential candidate. Being the only official contender in the race, Cruz drew large crowds during his two-day swing across the state. He's counting on Iowa, known for its vocal and active evangelical base, to propel him forward in what's expected to be a tough competition among a crowded field of GOP candidates. Cruz, himself, displays a pastoral swagger when he is speaking on stage and working a room. The senator regularly avoids using a podium, instead favoring pacing the stage with a wireless microphone, a scene reminiscent of a Sunday morning sermon. When he meets with people after events, he embraces each one's hand with both of his, softens his usually theatric tone and looks people square in the eye -- a familiar interaction between churchgoing Christians and their pastors. The past two winners of Iowa's caucuses rose to victory with support from the Christian right, and Cruz, who announced his bid last month at the well-known Baptist school Liberty University, is aiming to energize that same base and claim the coveted state as his prize. Evangelicals make up a large segment of Iowa's Republican voter bloc. According to a Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics poll from January, 44% of likely 2016 Republican caucus-goers said they were born-again or evangelical Christians. Cruz has built a brand as a stalwart conservative willing to buck GOP leadership on fiscal issues, but he showed in Iowa last week that he's also eager to champion social issues at a time when many Republicans are anxious to avoid them. He was one of the loudest defenders of the religious freedom law in Indiana, which came under fire last week for what critics called paving a path to discrimination against gays and lesbians. He described the outrage over the laws as "shameful" and an "assault" on First Amendment rights. "There are a lot of people here in Iowa and across the country whose hearts are breaking, watching what has happened in the last two weeks," Cruz said Friday night at an event in Des Moines. "We have seen a grossly unfair vilification of religious liberty." RELATED: Republican 2016 hopefuls back Indiana's'religious freedom' law. He's more than comfortable talking about his own faith and telling the story of how his father became a Christian and a pastor. Rafael Cruz, who's become a celebrity among Christian conservatives, will frequently visit Iowa over the next year, Cruz told voters. And Cruz's Iowa director, Bryan English, is a former pastor. Cruz's first television ads are appearing this weekend during programs on Fox News and NBC that are pegged to Easter Sunday. In the ad, Cruz talks about the impact of the "transformative love of Jesus Christ" on his life. While neither Mike Huckabee, who won Iowa in 2008, nor Rick Santorum, who won in 2012, went on to win the nomination, their successes helped launch them into high-profile battles with the then-front-runners. And with both of them likely running again in 2016, the competition will be stiff. That's why, for Cruz, courting evangelicals is only a component of a three-pronged strategy to win the nomination that also includes dominating the tea party faction and competing for the libertarian base. His stump speech hits on elements that appeal to each faction. He received standing ovations last week for calling to abolish the IRS, and, in a knock against the National Security Agency, he frequently tells audiences to leave their cell phones on so President Obama "can hear every word I have to say." Cruz argued Thursday that the Republican Party needs to bridge the gap between what he described as the Ron Paul-Rand Paul faction of the party -- young libertarian-minded voters -- and the Santorum base -- evangelicals. The two blocs, he said, are "not necessarily the best of chums." "If we're going to win, we've got to bring that coalition together," he said in Cedar Falls. "And I think we can do that." Cruz frequently says he wants to see a return of the evangelical vote to 2004 levels, when more than six in 10 evangelicals voted in the presidential election, a higher than normal turnout for the demographic. That number has waned slightly since 2004 -- but it's not too far off from the 56% of the overall population that voted in 2012. Still, his campaign believes that if it can tap into the group of evangelicals who've been staying home and get the demographic as a whole to overperform, then that could mean the difference of millions more at the polls. "If you look at available places for the party to expand the vote, it doesn't exist in the middle, it exists in the evangelical vote," said Rick Tyler, a top Cruz adviser. "It isn't a pond, it's an unfished ocean of available voters who are conservative." Russell Moore, president of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, said he expects to see record turnout among evangelicals in 2016 no matter who the nominee is or what that person says. Moore points to hot-button topics like religious freedom issues in the U.S., as well as increased attention to the killing of minority Christians in the Middle East and rising anti-Semitism. "I don't think a candidate is going to be able to get very far simply by using evangelical lingo or by pointing to his or her personal faith," Moore said. "I think a candidate is going to have to explain how he or she would protect religious liberty and would appoint justices and judges who will maintain the common good." Later in April, voters in Iowa will see the bulk of the GOP field tackle these issues when they take the stage at an event hosted by the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition. While the past two winners of the Iowa caucuses -- Santorum and Huckabee -- are likely running for president again, Steve Scheffler, president of the group, argued that the field is wide open in terms of who's going to win favor among evangelicals. Jeb Bush, while not popular among conservative activists, was known for his staunch anti-abortion record as Florida governor and touts his Catholic faith as a big force behind his policy views. Scott Walker is the son of a pastor. Ben Carson, the former neurosurgeon, rose to fame in conservative circles after criticizing the Obama administration at a national prayer breakfast. And other likely candidates -- from Marco Rubio to Rick Perry to Rand Paul -- have made serious efforts to court the religious right. "It's up for grabs. It's a clean slate regardless of if you've run before," Scheffler said. "Naturally those two (Huckabee and Santorum) have the name recognition and database of people who supported them in the past, but by and large voters are going to say, 'Let me take a good look at all of these candidates.'"

Article: Japan's J-League is just four games into a new season, but already the behaviour of its players is hitting the headlines for the wrong reasons after a player appeared to stamp on an opponent's face. Videos of the South Korean defender Kim Min Hyeok, who plays for Sagan Tosu, have gone viral after he allegedly brutally stamped on the face of opponent Mu Kanazaki. Sagan are ninth in the J-League and furious claims have been made that the 23-year-old deliberately committed the horrific foul after being jostled by 11th-placed Kashima Antlers player Kanazaki. Kim Min Hyeok (left) and Mu Kanazaki (right) fight it out for the ball on the wing during a J-League clash. After Kanazaki went down, it is alleged that Hyeok stamped down on the face of his fallen opponent. Despite the vicious looking nature of Hyeok’s apparent attack and Kanazaki’s dramatic clutch to his face, the defender only received a yellow card and was allowed to play on, much to the fans' uproar. Whether or not the foul was intentional, it is suspected that the reason for Japanese  fans’ outcry is not so much the act itself, but the fact that it was committed by a South Korean player. Hyeok's boot appears to scrape down Kanazaki's face, but the man on the floor came out as the winner later. Hyeok was somehow only shown a yellow card for the challenge that infuriated fans at the stadium. Some Japanese fans have demanded not only the expulsion of Hyeok, but of all South Koreans, from the game. However, regardless of the controversy, justice - to some extent - was served when the supposed stamped-on player’s team won 3-1, with Kanazaki among the goals.

Article: (CNN)One hundred and forty-seven victims. Many more families affected. Even more broken hopes and dreams. As Kenyans mourned those killed last week in one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in the nation, citizens used social media to share the victims' stories, hopes and dreams. Using the hashtag #147notjustanumber -- a reference to the number of people, mostly students, killed at Garissa University College on Thursday -- Kenyans tweeted pictures of the victims in happier times. Kenyan authorities have not released a list of the victims. The posts provided heart-wrenching details on the victims, including one about an elderly man whose dreams died with his son. He had reportedly taken a loan to educate him at the university, where he was killed by Al-Shabaab terrorists. The attack in Kenya killed 142 students, three security officers and two university security personnel, and was the nation's deadliest since the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in 1998. Kenyan churches mourned the dead during Easter services Sunday as armed guards protected the congregations. In emotional services nationwide, churchgoers wept as they paid tribute to the victims of the massacre. The gunmen who attacked the university in the predawn hours separated Muslims from Christians and killed the latter. The extremist group has also killed Muslims in recent attacks. The Interior Ministry has identified one of the attackers killed by security forces as the son of a government official. The father of suspect Abdirahim Abdullahi is a chief in Mandera and had reported his son missing, officials said. The Islamist extremist group is based in Somalia, but it hasn't confined its terrorism to the nation that shares a border with Kenya. In 2013, militants attacked Nairobi's upscale Westgate Mall, killing nearly 70 people.

Article: (CNN)The California Public Utilities Commission on Thursday said it is ordering Pacific Gas & Electric Co. to pay a record $1.6 billion penalty for unsafe operation of its gas transmission system, including the pipeline rupture that killed eight people in San Bruno in September 2010. Most of the penalty amounts to forced spending on improving pipeline safety. Of the $1.6 billion, $850 million will go to "gas transmission pipeline safety infrastructure improvements," the commission said. Another $50 million will go toward "other remedies to enhance pipeline safety," according to the commission. "PG&E failed to uphold the public's trust," commission President Michael Picker said. "The CPUC failed to keep vigilant. Lives were lost. Numerous people were injured. Homes were destroyed. We must do everything we can to ensure that nothing like this happens again." The company's chief executive officer said in a written statement that PG&E is working to become the safest energy company in the United States. "Since the 2010 explosion of our natural gas transmission pipeline in San Bruno, we have worked hard to do the right thing for the victims, their families and the community of San Bruno," Tony Earley said. "We are deeply sorry for this tragic event, and we have dedicated ourselves to re-earning the trust of our customers and the communities we serve. The lessons of this tragic event will not be forgotten." On September 9, 2010, a section of PG&E pipeline exploded in San Bruno, killing eight people and injuring more than 50 others. The blast destroyed 37 homes. PG&E said it has paid more than $500 million in claims to the victims and victims' families in San Bruno, which is just south of San Francisco. The company also said it has already replaced more than 800 miles of pipe, installed new gas leak technology and implemented nine of 12 recommendations from the National Transportation Safety Board. According to its website, PG&E has 5.4 million electric customers and 4.3 million natural gas customers. The Los Angeles Times reported the previous record penalty was a $146 million penalty against Southern California Edison Company in 2008 for falsifying customer and worker safety data. CNN's Jason Hanna contributed to this report.

Article: Boston (CNN)Guilty across the board. But will he face death? After deliberating for 11½ hours, jurors found Dzhokhar Tsarnaev guilty on Wednesday of all 30 counts he faced in the Boston Marathon bombing trial. Seventeen of the 30 counts were capital charges, meaning he is eligible for the death penalty. The trial will next move into a penalty phase, where the jury will hear testimony and arguments from both sides and ultimately be tasked with deciding whether Tsarnaev, 21, will be executed. A look at all of the charges. Jurors will be asked to weigh aggravating factors such as the heinousness of his crimes against mitigating factors such as his family and mental health history, as well as his relative youth. Tsarnaev was 19 at the time of the bombing. The start date of the penalty phase has not yet been set. Since testimony began March 4, federal prosecutors have called 92 witnesses, and the defense just four. It seemed a mismatch from the start. "He was there," Tsarnaev's defense attorney Judy Clarke conceded as the trial opened, but many say the defense strategy always had been to focus on persuading the jury to spare Tsarnaev's life. Tsarnaev lawyer keeps hated criminals off death row. Clarke tried to convince jurors that her client's older brother, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who died in a shootout with police days after the terror attack, was the instigator of the marathon plot. The younger man, Clarke said, was only following his older brother. After the verdict, CNN legal analyst Paul Callan said Clarke now faces an uphill battle. "Because No. 1, he (Tsarnaev) is almost functioning as an officer of a military organization attacking the United States -- the claim of course that he's an Islamic radical and that this is almost an army-like attack on civilians. "And the second thing -- it was so well planned and so callously planned so that civilians would die, so that children would be maimed. And all of this, she has to get around and convince the jury he's not worthy of the death penalty. "Boy, she's climbing the Mount Everest of death penalty cases in this case," Callan said about Clarke. Survivors react to the verdict. Ann O'Neill reported from Boston. Dana Ford reported from Atlanta.

Article: Chelsea goalkeeper Thibault Courtois insists he has not lost any sleep over his high-profile errors of recent weeks. The Belgian was exceptional for the Blues in their win over Queens Park Rangers on Sunday. It was a far cry from his displays in Chelsea's previous two matches, however. Thibaut Courtois (centre) was in phenomenal form as Chelsea beat rivals Queens Park Rangers on Sunday. Courtois (centre) has struggled in previous weeks and his error led to a  goal for Hull on March 22. Courtois cut a despondent man against Hull (left) but was back on form against QPR on Sundat. His poor touch allowed Abel Hernandez to score in Chelsea's 3-2 win over Hull on March 22 before Stoke's Charlie Adam beat him from 66 yards last weekend. But Courtois says his confidence levels have not waned as a result. 'I never doubted that I can't catch the ball. Against Hull, I just tried to make the best solution,' he said. 'It was not the best control, but in the second half I showed that I am mentally strong and I saved the team. 'Against Stoke, if you want to play high as a team, you as a goalkeeper have to play high as a team as well. Charlie Adam did a good strike and that can happen. 'But I showed against QPR that if you play high, you can go get the ball from the midfield. If I'm on the 16 yard box, I can go get it there. For me it's not a problem. Courtois has also faced criticism for failing to keep out Charlie Adam's 66-yard strike against Stoke. Courtois (right) said he never doubted himself during his indifferent spell of form for Chelsea. 'I continue. I never doubt myself. That's my strength. I helped the team with two good saves against QPR and I'm happy. 'The most important thing is the team and against Hull and Stoke we still won. 'I'm 22 and still learning. These were moments which I could learn from.'

Article: (CNN)Four workers died in a massive oil rig fire that raged for hours off the coast of Mexico Wednesday. Mexican state oil company Pemex said 45 workers were injured in the blaze, which began early Wednesday morning. Two of them are in serious condition, the company said. Authorities evacuated about 300 people from the Abkatun Permanente platform after the fire started, Pemex said. At least 10 boats worked to battle the blaze for hours. The fire had been extinguished by Wednesday night, Pemex said in a Twitter post. The company denied rumors that the platform had collapsed and said there was no oil spill as a result of the fire. The state oil company hasn't said what caused the fire on the platform, which is located in the Gulf of Mexico's Campeche Sound. The fire began in the platform's dehydration and pumping area, Pemex said. CNN's Mayra Cuevas contributed to this report.

Article: Ruby Walsh appears to jump his horse over a moving car in the latest promotional advert for betting firm Paddy Power. The 22-second clip shows the two-time Grand National winner galloping towards the speeding silver car and apparently jumping it as the bookmaker gears up for Saturday's big race at Aintree. Irish jockey Walsh, who is riding Ballycasey in the race, starts the clip by saying: 'This is how I've been getting ready for this year's Grand National.' The clip starts with champion jockey Ruby Walsh describing how he will prepare for the Grand National. The two-time National jockey appears to then leap over the speeding car on his horse. The horse clears the car, which Paddy Power say was travelling at 40mph, and lands. Walsh celebrates with a raised arm after completing the'stunt' Paddy Power claims he jumped straight over the car, which was said to be travelling at 40mph. The horse barely clears the car's roof before landing. Walsh stands upright and raises his right arm in apparent celebration after the horse lands and gallops away. It is not the first time the bookmaker has produced a controversial advert ahead of a major racing festival. In February 2012, a publicity stunt prior to the Cheltenham Festival featured a suited hitman firing tranquillizer darts at unsuspecting members of the public, promising to 'take care of the chavs - veterinary style.' It was inspired by loutish racegoers fighting at Ascot. Another advert released ahead of the 2012 Cheltenham Festival showed a clip of transgender racegoers and invited viewers to spot the'stallions' from the'mares.' Walsh pictured after riding Sempre Medici to victory on Irish Grand National Day at Fairyhouse last week. The Irish jockey will ride Ballycasey in Saturday's Grand National at Aintree. It was banned from television broadcast by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) after it received 92 complaints the ad was offensive and condoned and encouraged harmful discriminatory behaviour. Although banned from TV, both adverts remain easily accessible on the internet. Another advert ahead of the Ryder Cup last year saw UKIP leader Nigel Farage feature in a spoof political broadcast in which he was'swinging for Europe'. Walsh, 35, has twice won the Grand National before - on Papillon in 2000 and Hedgehunter in 2005.

Article: (CNN)Easter is unique on the Christian calendar, a major point in the cycle of the religious year, and one that has always been able to resist the commercialization and culture warring that surrounds Christmas. That's in part because Easter is genuinely about how religious impulses, and patterns, can operate in ways that affect our lives. Nevertheless, I'm often surprised by how little people, even those supposedly within the Christian tradition, actually know about what is called Holy Week and its culmination on Easter Sunday.   At a time when our culture is roiled by questions of identity and ethics (and tolerance) that have profound religious implications, it's worth pausing to explore this crucial holiday -- and the awareness of the human condition, in all its sadness and glory, that it engenders. After all, Holy Week calls mostly to those who incline their minds and hearts in its direction with seriousness of intent.  Still, the fuss must puzzle those looking on, wondering what it all means.  Why do Christians make so much of this springtime week, and make so much of Easter weekend? There is a phrase that many never come across, even among Christians:  Easter Triduum.  This refers to the three days of Easter that begin with Good Friday, proceed through Holy Saturday, and conclude with Easter Sunday.  It's definitely a progression, although the word itself -- triduum -- can refer to any three days of prayer. Easter Triduum has a kind of major prologue in Maundy Thursday, the day when, by tradition, Jesus celebrated the Last Supper with his disciples in the upper room in Jerusalem on the night before he was crucified.  The idea of Holy Communion begins with this meal, which was a Passover meal. Jesus, of course, was Jewish, as were all his disciples.  He was never trying to erase Judaism and found a new religion.  His work involved modifying and extending Judaism in fresh ways. On Maundy Thursday, Christians sometimes practice the washing of feet, recalling that Jesus washed the very dusty feet of his disciples at the Last Supper as a way of demonstrating profound humility -- showing that he was himself a servant -- and modeling a kind of ideal behavior. Good Friday isn't, in fact, so good.  It's the day of the crucifixion, when Jesus was scourged and beaten, forced to carry his cross to Golgotha, the "place of the skull," and nailed to the cross itself for what must have been an agonizing death.  The actual scene of the Crucifixion varies from gospel to gospel, as do his last words, assembled into the so-called "seven last words" of Jesus by adding up fragments from different gospels. Some of these words are quotations, as when Jesus asked God why he has abandoned him:  This is a quote from the 22nd Psalm, which opens:  "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"  Good Friday is a day of death, sacrifice, displacement, fear. Holy Saturday is probably the least understood day of the Easter Triduum.  It's a passageway between the darkness of the crucifixion and the bright hope of Easter.  This day occupies an anxious space in human experience, when the certain knowledge of something dreadful isn't quite erased -- can't be erased -- simply by hope.  It's a day of depression, a day of suspension. Then comes Easter, with the aura of the resurrection.  I'm always moved by the deep symbolism of this mythic moment, when the body of Christ becomes what is called a "glorified body."  This was not, as I've said elsewhere, the Great Resuscitation, although that's part of it, too.  Resurrection implies a total transformation, something beyond the physical realm. It's very important that almost nobody who encounters Jesus after the resurrection can really recognize him, know him, or understand him as the same person who was with them before he was crucified.  Easter embraces the great mystery of resurrection, with its promise of transformation -- a shift from one form to another, and a change that moves well beyond any literal understanding. The three days of Easter, the Triduum, occur only once a year on the calendar.  But the really interesting thing is that we all experience the pattern of the three days again and again.  We find ourselves emptied out in small ways, nailed to our own trees in life, embarrassed or broken by life. It was the Buddha who famously observed that life is suffering.  Good Friday embodies the Christian version of that truth.  Jesus suffered in the way all of us must suffer.  We must all die, perhaps less ignominiously but just as certainly.  Our friends and families must die.  We all experience illness, loss, sadness, a loss of confidence, darkness.  This is simply part of the human experience. We dive again and again into Holy Saturday, too -- a period of transition, when the bleakness of suffering is perhaps slightly behind us but nothing restorative seems in view.  We know well this in-between time; it's an anxious passage, with only a glimmer on the horizon of potential hope. And we've all been resurrected, again and again, perhaps in tiny ways.  This is the joy of Easter, and it's not something reserved for one day on the calendar.  It's there whenever we experience what T.S. Eliot once called the "timeless moment," which can only occur -- paradoxically -- in time itself.  It's a mystical point where timelessness intersects with time. I suspect we all experience the Triduum frequently, sometimes more than once in a single day.  But the ritual enactment of these three days of the Easter season reminds all of those who practice Christianity -- and perhaps those who don't -- that we should expect to move through darkness into light. It's a pattern that describes a kind of spiritual progression.   It's good cause for celebration, too:  and one that won't easily be co-opted by secular culture.

Article: Brendan Rodgers has insisted that Raheem Sterling will not be sold this summer, even if he fails to agree a new long-term contract at Anfield. But as we've seen in the past - with Luis Suarez's move to Barcelona a prime example - that sort of promise isn't always kept. Here, Sportsmail takes a look at five possible destinations for the England man. Raheem Sterling, pictured in training on Thursday, has attracted interest from a number of big clubs. ARSENAL. The Gunners have a genuine interest in the Liverpool wonderkid and believe they have the financial capabilities to pull off a mega-deal. But when push comes to shove, can they emerge victorious in what could turn out to be an auction? Sterling has rejected a contract worth £100,000-a-week and could look to force a move away from Liverpool. CHELSEA. The big question is how would Sterling fit into Jose Mourinho's plans given his wealth of attacking talent. But when the best players become available, the best clubs are always in the market. It is no different with the Blues. London will also be a major pull for Sterling. MANCHESTER CITY. City are always in the market for the best British talent as they try to keep up with homegrown quota regulations. Sterling will, perhaps, be the best available British player in the market this summer. Expect City to make their move early in the transfer window. Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has insisted that the club will not sell Sterling this summer. MANCHESTER UNITED. Would Sterling do it? Would Liverpool sell to United? It would certainly a bold move should he join Liverpool's fiercest rivals. They certainly have the finances to make a deal happen. United are looking for superstars this summer. This would be a super transfer. BAYERN MUNICH. Pep Guardiola is understood to be a big fan of the 20-year-old. But would Sterling be up for playing abroad at such an early stage of his career? If he is, then expect Bayern to be in the running for his signature this summer. Bayern Munich boss Pep Guardiola is believed to be keen on Sterling and could make a move for him.

Raheem Sterling could leave Liverpool in the summer transfer window. Arsenal and Manchester City are both interested in signing him. Chelsea could make a big money move if Sterling becomes available. Bayern Munich boss Pep Guardiola is believed to be an admirer.

Article: (CNN)Police in India are putting aside their batons in favor of an overhead solution to angry and unruly crowds: pepper-spraying drones. Yashasvi Yadav, Senior Superintendent of police in Lucknow, northern India, told CNN the city's force has bought four drones and is in the process of purchasing one more. "The drones have been tested in controlled conditions," he said. "They have been very successful and will be used by the Lucknow police whenever there are violent protests or mob attacks." The miniature aircraft will be fitted with a camera and pepper spray; each drone costs between $9,560 and $19,300, Yadav added. Views on the new measure are mixed, with some concerned about the suppression of freedom of speech -- an already contentious issue in India. Last month, the country failed to enforce a law that would allow authorities to arrest people who post offensive material on social media. Others believe the country could learn from events further afield. Some say this method of crowd control needs regulation too. Questions have also been raised as to why the police are resorting to aggression. "While I think it is bound to fail if not be another scam in the making, it also shows the mindset of the administration to not use dialogue and mediation to solve problems but use authoritarian and forceful methods," photojournalist Chirag Wakaskar in Mumbai told CNN. "What they could do is start by having video surveillance in sensitive areas and have swifter justice." Protests are a common occurrence in India, a country with a population of 1.2 billion; Lucknow, the capital of the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, also used drone cameras to monitor crowds at a recent religious festival. As well as being used as a security measure in other cities including Delhi and Mumbai, the unmanned, airborne vehicles have been used in tiger hunts, disaster relief and criminal investigations -- and even pizza deliveries. Reports suggest that the drone surveillance will be officially launched by the Chief Minister of Lucknow, Akhilesh Yadav, later this month. Kunal Sehgal contributed to this report.

Article: (CNN)Just as the agency begins to recover from a series of high-profile missteps, the Secret Service is facing yet another scandal. A female employee accused Xavier Morales, a supervisor within the agency, of assault after he made sexual advances at  her, according to The Washington Post. "The woman told police and agency investigators that Morales, her boss, told her during the party at Capitol City Brewing Company that he was in love with her and would like to have sex with her," and later tried to kiss her in the office, according to a report from The Washington Post. During the incident, he "grabbed her arms when she resisted" and the two tussled until Morales gave up, sources told the paper. The Post reports that the March 31 party was in celebration of Morales' new assignment as head of the Louisville field office. A Secret Service spokesperson confirms that  Morales was placed on administrative leave and his security clearance was suspended. This incident was first reported on April 2, and Secret Service Director Joe Clancy was briefed that afternoon. Clancy called the allegations "very disturbing." "Any threats or violence that endangers our employees in  the workplace is unacceptable and will not be tolerated," he said in a statement. This is just the latest chapter for an organization embroiled in scandal over the past several months. Last month, two top-ranking officials were suspended following an incident at a White House command post during an investigation of a possible bomb. Clancy was not made aware of the episode until five days later. The agency has also faced scrutiny for another lapse in late January when a drone crash-landed on the White House lawn. Secret Service Director Julia Pierson resigned in September after a fence-jumper gained access to the East Room of the White House. Earlier in September, an armed security contractor was allowed to get into an elevator with President Barack Obama during a trip to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. An independent report released in December found that the Secret Service is stretched "beyond its limits," needing more training, more staff, and a director from outside its ranks. Clancy, who formally assumed the post in February, is a 27-year veteran of the agency. "It's going to take time to change some of this culture," Clancy said at a House Appropriations Committee hearing last month. "There's no excuse for this information not to come up the chain. That's going to take time because I'm going to have to build trust with our workforce." The incident will be further investigated by the Office of the Inspector General.

Article: Gareth Bale drives an unstoppable left-footed bullet in at the far post during a routine training drill as Real Madrid train on Wednesday. It's powerful, poised and emphatic, though far from a winner at the Nou Camp, but it's all the Welshman can do for now as he returns from international duty to a less than appreciative fan base. Bale joined Cristiano Ronaldo and Co for their second day back at training as they prepared for their first match back after the devastating loss to Barcelona that saw them fall four points behind the La Liga leaders. Gareth Bale chests down a cross from the right before unleashing a bullet in Real Madrid training. Perfectly balanced, Bale cocks his powerful left leg to hit his shot on the half-volley. Having hit the ball sweetly it rockets into the net at the far post giving the keeper no chance. The under fire winger returns to Madrid on the back of a vital double for Wales against Israel as they claimed top spot in Euro 2016 qualifying's group B. Showing no signs of the drama he's been subject to in Spain, including an attack on his white Bentley by a so-called fan, Bale scored his 15th and 16th goals for his country. His first came from a curling free-kick over the wall before his second, a strong finish after arriving late into the area, marked his 20th for the season in all competitions. Bale evades Nacho Fernandez  during training session at Valdebebas training ground on Wednesday. Cristiano Ronaldo works up a sweat at training (left) left as Marcelo brings the ball down on his chest. Playmaker Luka Modric (left) keeps control as defensive midfielder Asier Illarramendi watches closely. Back from duty with Germany, Toni Kroos (right) comes up against Spaniard Illarramendi. Bale holds off Fernandez in a star-studded pack of players at Carlo Ancelotti's disposal. Goals aside, Bale was a menace throughout the match, constantly asking questions against the side that until this match led Wales and Belgium in the group. Carlo Ancelotti and his state employed small-sided games and shooting drills to bring Real back to business as usual on Wednesday as they prepare to take on 19th-placed Granada on Sunday in an early 11am kick-off. Real have won just one of their last five games in all competitions - and was a 2-0 home victory against Levante in which Bale, the player Real fans have seemingly fallen out of love with, scored both goals. James Rodriguez (left), who is continuing his recovery from injury, and Marcelo find cause for a fist pump. Rodriguez puts pressure on young prospect Martin Odegaard (right) ahead of their clash with Granada. Speaking on Spanish TV, Alvaro Arbeloa spoke out in defence of Bale saying the fans' treatment of the 25-year-old is inexpicable. 'They have it out for him. He's done a great job since he arrived at the club and I don't understand this witch hunt against him',' he said on Neox TV's El Chiringuito. The defender had similar words for Ronaldo, who has also faced hash criticism of late. 'They've been very unfair with him. Nobody can doubt his professionalism. He has every right to think they've been unfair to him. You cannot be as good as Cristiano unless you are very demanding with yourself, or the first player in training, or you look after yourself at home.'

Article: Marseille, France (CNN)Investigators have collected all the main evidence from the site where Germanwings Flight 9525 crashed, a French national police official told CNN on Saturday. Investigators are not expected to return to the crash site, said Capt. Yves Naffrechoux of the High Mountain Gendarmerie. The plane crashed March 24 in rugged terrain of the Alps about 6 miles (10 kilometers) from the town of Seyne-les-Alpes. "All the police investigators have left the (Germanwings) crash site," he said. "There is only a private security company ensuring security around the crash site so that no one can go there." The security firm will guard the site until the remaining debris is collected and taken to secure locations for further analysis, if necessary, he said. The flight data recorder, or "black box," was found Thursday by a member of the recovery team. The cockpit voice recorder was found days after the crash. In addition, out of more than 2,000 DNA samples collected from the crash site, lab workers have isolated 150 DNA profiles, said Brice Robin, Marseilles prosecutor. The crash killed all 150 people on board. Brice Robin, Marseilles prosecutor, said authorities have found 470 personnel effects at the site. That number includes 40 cell phones, though all those were badly damaged. Robin cast doubt that any useful information could be retrieved from those phones, given their condition. Authorities say the flight's co-pilot, Andreas Lubitz, locked the captain out of the cockpit and engineered the plane's demise. Initial tests on the flight data recorder show that Lubitz purposely used the controls to speed up the plane's descent, according to the French air accident investigation agency, the BEA. It also has emerged that Lubitz had battled depression years before he took the controls of Flight 9525 and that he had concealed from his employer recent medical leave notes saying he was unfit for work.

Article: Barcelona's Brazilian star Neymar was left fuming after being substituted by Luis Enrique during the 2-2 draw at Sevilla on Saturday night, according to reports in Spain. Neymar, who scored his side's second goal with a curling free kick, was replaced with the score at 2-1 and 15 minutes to play. Sevilla then scored a late equaliser, and Neymar 'can't understand why he is subbed so much' reports Spanish paper Sport. Neymar's dispute with Luis Enrique features prominently in Spain, while they look ahead to the Madrid derby. The paper points out that the forward has been replaced in 15 of his 34 matches this season, with only Ivan Rakitic and Andres Iniesta being substituted more.

Elsewhere in Spain the attention is focused on the Madrid derby in this week's Champions League quarter-finals. Marca claims that the game is 'like a final', with the two teams playing out a repeat of last year's showdown in Lisbon, while in AS, Real defender Pepe calls for intensity and humility. In Italy the headlines are dominated by Lazio, who moved above their city rivals Roma into second place in Serie A with a win over Empoli. AS also look ahead to the Champions League quarter-final, while in Italy the focus is on Lazio's win.

Article: (The Hollywood Reporter)"Grace of Monaco," starring Nicole Kidman as star-turned-princess Grace Kelly, is heading straight to Lifetime. The critically-panned film, which opened last year's Cannes Film Festival, will premiere on Lifetime on Memorial Day, May 25. After the movie performed poorly in its international engagements, The Weinstein Co., which first purchased U.S. distribution rights at the 2013 Berlin Film Festival, decided to sell it directly to Lifetime rather than book it into U.S. theaters, a source confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter. THR: Grace of Monaco' Cannes review. The film, which was directed by Olivier Dahan and focuses on a period in the early '60s when Monaco was involved in a stand-off over taxes with France and Grace was contemplating a return to Hollywood, was originally scheduled for release in late 2013. Given the names involved, some handicappers had put it on their list of potential Oscar contenders. But when TWC pulled it out of awards contention and shifted its release to March 14, 2014, Dahan lashed out at TWC's Harvey Weinstein, over the movie's final cut, which the director was in the process of completing. "There are two versions of the film for now, mine and his," Dahan complained, continuing, "They want a commercial film smelling of daisies, taking out anything that exceeds that which is too abrupt, anything that makes it cinematic and breathe with life." That planned March release was then scrubbed, when Cannes expressed interest in debuting the director's version of the movie in May. Even before it screened, though, Grace's children blasted the picture as "needlessly glamorized and historically inaccurate" and boycotting the Cannes red carpet. THR: The Weinstein Co. nearing deal to keep 'Grace of Monaco' Weinstein didn't attend the movie's premiere either -- explaining that he had been visiting Syrian refugee camps in Jordan as part of a long-scheduled U.N.-sponsored trip. But TWC did strike a new distribution deal for the film in Cannes, agreeing to show Dahan's cut in the U.S., but acquiring rights for just $3 million upfront, a $2 million discount from its earlier contract. But TWC then did not slot "Grace of Monaco" into its fall, 2015 release schedule. Tim Roth costars as Kelly's husband Prince Rainier III, Frank Langella as Kelly's priest and confidante, Parker Posey as Grace's aid, and Paz Vega ("Spanglish," "Sex and Lucia") as opera singer Maria Callas.

Article: Alan Pardew says Sunderland should be more concerned about his in-form Crystal Palace side than his past as Newcastle manager this Saturday. Palace beat Manchester City on Monday night and have ambitions of finishing in the Barclays Premier League's top 10 this season. Pardew was the first Newcastle boss to suffer four successive defeats to Sunderland, who last weekend won a fifth Tyne-Wear derby in a row, but is now only thinking about Palace. 'We're going there in great form. The stadium will be wary of us, the 11 players on the pitch,' Pardew said. Glenn Murray (second from right) celebrates with his  team-mates after scoring against Manchester City. Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew thinks Sunderland fans should concentrate on his in-form side. 'Irrespective of my reception, it's about the 11 players on the pitch and Sunderland fans know that we're in really good form. 'The group is on a high. We have a different type of game this Saturday and we need to make the adjustment quickly.' Pardew arrived at Selhurst Park in January with top-flight survival the target. Performances and results have surpassed expectations, but Pardew insists the Eagles must stick to the characteristics which have seen them soar to 11th place in the table. 'It is now about trying to keep our professionalism and keep on the process of what's been winning us games,' Pardew added. 'We haven't set an outcome target, in terms of points we're going to get, but we have talked about the standards that we've set and that we need to maintain those. 'If we maintain them, then our position might surprise a few. Jason Puncheon celebrates after scoring Palace's winning goal in their 2-1 victory against champions City. Jermain Defoe scores a stunning winner for Sunderland in the Tyne-Wear derby against Newcastle. 'We're three points away from the top 10 so of course it is (a realistic target).' Pardew believes Palace players will be viewed in a more favourable light when it comes to international honours. He said: 'All our players are going to be looked at in a kinder manner, or through a different lens to how they've been looked at - and so they should be. 'Our form is as good as the top three or four clubs in the country and therefore they should receive the plaudits for what they're doing. That would be only what they deserve.' Mile Jedinak could come straight in after his four-game suspension as midfielder Joe Ledley is a doubt with a hip injury. Pardew added: 'Joe Ledley's got a slight strain and we'll have to monitor that. 'He's been exceptional since I've been here, so we'll give him every opportunity to play.' Pardew, after four years as Newcastle boss, knows Sunderland well and was not surprised the Black Cats turned to former Rangers and Holland boss Dick Advocaat. 'I think it was a great move for them to have someone of his experience at this time and he's proving that,' Pardew added. 'It's fair to say they've gone a little bit more direct, a little bit more positive. 'They have some good players and it's always a difficult place to go. 'I don't think we're under an illusions. It's a team coming off the back of a great victory (beating Newcastle 1-0) and they will be buoyed for our game.

Crystal Palace face Sunderland at the Stadium of Light on Saturday. Ex-Newcastle boss Alan Pardew is prepared for a frosty reception. But he believes Black Cats fans should be more concerned about his side. Sunderland are 15th in the table and three points clear of the drop zone.

Article: (CNN)In her 40 years living in Rochelle, Illinois, Cathy Olson had never seen a tornado that big. "I saw the top of the funnel cloud, and it was absolutely massive," she said. She watched the hulking gray twister grind past her town Thursday, tearing up its fringes. Farther north, in the rural Illinois hamlet of Fairdale, one person died as a twister shredded homes and ripped trees bare of leaves and most limbs. Only the thickest branches remained standing. It was the only death reported so far in two days of tornado touchdowns. Rochelle was fortunate. But in nearby Kirkland, debris was so thick on the roads, responders searching for trapped residents could not yet assess the damage or injuries, fire officials said. On Thursday, a video surfaced on YouTube of a massive twister barreling across an open field, barely missing farmhouses and barns. Images of the funnel turned up elsewhere on social media. Multiple tornadoes ripped through the rural Midwest on Thursday. A  large and dangerous twister tore across fields in Iowa. And a twister touched down 70 miles outside of St. Louis. Eight tornadoes were reported Wednesday in Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri, the Storm Prediction Center said. But it appears residents have been fortunate enough to come away from the terrifying weather spectacle alive. Hail stones the size of tennis balls plummeted down on Ashton, Illinois. It could have been worse as severe tornado damage dotted a path not far from the dense populations of Chicago and Rockford -- the state's third largest city.  The tornado cut a 22-mile path through Ogle County, according to disaster management coordinator Tom Richter. North of Rochelle, a tornado took away a local favorite restaurant -- Grubsteakers.  "It's kind of one of your little greasy spoon restaurants," said Eric Widick, who drove up in his truck to help out. "We're a community. If one person is in need, we'll all be there for them." People were inside when the storm quashed Grubsteakers and turned over a semitruck parked outside. No one was killed or seriously injured,  Widick said. Although a patron who found shelter in a restroom was trapped inside for about half an hour. People had been eating at Grubsteakers for some 25 years and will miss it, Widick said. In Rochelle, the tornado flattened some of Olson's friends' homes. A safe distance away from it, at her mother's house, she had to think about her husband, Chet, who was reelected mayor of the town of about 10,000 people the day before. He'd have a job ahead of him. "I have not been able to get a hold of him, Olson said, "but I know he's in touch with the sheriff and is safe," she said. Sheriff Brian VanVickle told journalists late Thursday that the tornado had spared life and limb in Ogle County aside from some people whose injuries were easily treatable. The county lost 20 homes -- one of them was his own. Fifty to 100 houses had significant damage, he said. Only foundations remained of some homes, said storm chaser Dan Gottschalk. "You can hear the hissing everywhere from where the structures used to be," he said. Lindsey Clark, a reporter from CNN affiliate WREX, said rescuers were pulling trapped people from a home in the Rochelle area. VanVickle was newly elected sheriff of Rochelle on Wednesday. On Thursday, the storm took his house and his sister-in-law's. "I've got the clothes on my back," he said. But his family wasn't at home when it hit. "My family was on the way to Louisville, dog was in the basement and she survived." It was the first tornado the sheriff had ever seen in his county. "I've lived here all my life, am the fifth generation in the county.  My mom said this is the first time she's ever seen a tornado." He is thankful that the National Weather Service warned one could come. That saved lives, he believes. The service warned of a "particularly dangerous situation." People across the Midwest should be on alert for severe weather. Tornado watches were set to run out early Friday. CNN's AnneClaire Stapleton, Catherine Shoichet, Greg Botelho, Dave Alsup, Steve Almasy, Jack Maddox and Sean Morris contributed to this report.

Article: Sunday's trip to Loftus Road marks Chelsea’s 700th game under the ownership of Roman Abramovich, a period Jose Mourinho says has been positive not only for the club but for English football as a whole. Some would quibble with the second part of that statement, but Mourinho says that too will change. If the first 699 games under Russian rule has established Chelsea at the top of English and European football, Mourinho believes the next 700 will see them supply more players for the English national team as they implement Abramovich’s demand to follow Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules. Sunday's trip to Loftus Road marks Chelsea’s 700th game under the ownership of Roman Abramovich. Abramovich (right) celebrates with Frank Lampard (centre) and John Terry after Chelsea clinch their first Premier League title under his ownership in 2005. The Russian finally got his hands on the Champions League trophy following Chelsea's success in 2012. Mourinho also believes Chelsea’s adherence to FFP — ‘compared with other clubs and owners who didn’t want to play under the rules’, he pointed out in a thinly veiled dig at Manchester City — positions them as standard bearers for the English game. There can certainly be no doubt Chelsea are in a far stronger position than when Abramovich bought the club from Ken Bates for £140m on June 1, 2003. In the intervening 12 years he has spent in the region of £842.9m on transfer fees, winning three Premier Leagues, four FA Cups, three League Cups, one Europa League and one Champions League, but now, Mourinho says, Abramovich’s rule will benefit England as well as Chelsea. Jose Mourinho, seen here with Abramovich in 2004, has has been in charge of Chelsea for almost five of the Russian's 12 seasons at Stamford Bridge. The Blues have won three Premier Leagues, four FA Cups, three League Cups, one Europa League and one Champions League since 2004. ‘He has been good for Chelsea, good for English football, good for European football,’ said Mourinho, who has been in charge for almost five of those 12 seasons. ‘Chelsea after him became strong, a top club in the country and a top club in Europe. I think that’s very, very good. I think it’s important and I think it’s also important the message Mr Abramovich and this club are passing now. ‘The decision to accept the [Financial Fair Play] rules and play under the rules I think is a big decision compared with other clubs and other owners that didn’t accept the rules and didn’t want to play under the rules. Chelsea are in a far stronger position than when Abramovich bought the club from Ken Bates in 2003. ‘Will the next 700 games under him be good for the English national side? I believe so. In the first team, we had some important players in the national team. 'John Terry, Ashley Cole, Joe Cole, Frank Lampard, Wayne Bridge, Shaun Wright-Phillips. We had a nucleus of four, five players that were always in the national team. ‘Now we are going through a period where it’s just about Gary Cahill. But we have some young boys coming into the first-team. Ruben [Loftus-Cheek] is already here. Normally, in a few years they should be there [in the national side].’ Gary Cahill (above) is now Chelsea's only senior England international in the current first team squad. Mourinho believes the likes of Ruben Loftus-Cheek (left) and Dominic Solanke will represent Chelsea and England for years to come. Mourinho did not name them, but Dominic Solanke, Patrick Bamford, Lewis Baker and Isaiah Brown are thought to be highly-rated at Chelsea, who supply many of the players in England’s age-group teams. The question is whether their young English players will be given the chance in the first team at a club who can take a huge step towards the title by winning at QPR today. It is a game Chelsea go into mindful of decisive slips in last season’s title race but with the title firmly in their own hands now, Mourinho is confident no mistakes will be made. Chelsea are on the verge of a domestic double after picking up the Capital One Cup in March. Mourinho has won seven major trophies while in charge of the west London club. He added: ‘Don’t make me remember the game against Sunderland because that was the game which stopped us fighting for the title. I don’t want to speak again about that game. ‘Last season we were depending on others. We needed this team to lose a couple of points here, a couple of points there. This situation is different. ‘Now we are in a position where we can be isolated of everything. We don’t have to be watching Man City against Man United. We don’t have to be waiting for what they are going to do. It’s just us.’ Fabio Borini celebrates scoring the winning goal during Sunderland's 2-1 win against Chelsea last season. Mourinho believes last season's defeat against Sunderland'stopped' Chelsea from fighting for the title.

Article: (CNN)Eyewitness video showing white North Charleston police Officer Michael Slager shooting to death an unarmed black man has exposed discrepancies in the reports of the first officers on the scene. Slager has been fired and charged with murder in the death of 50-year-old Walter Scott. A bystander's cell phone video, which began after an alleged struggle on the ground between Slager and Scott, shows the five-year police veteran shooting at Scott eight times as Scott runs away. Scott was hit five times. If words were exchanged between the men, they're are not audible on the tape. It's unclear what happened before Scott ran, or why he ran. The officer initially said that he used a Taser on Scott, who, Slager said, tried to take the weapon. Before Slager opens fire, the video shows a dark object falling behind Scott and hitting the ground. It's unclear whether that is the Taser. Later in the video, when Slager approaches Scott's body, Slager appears to drop a dark object near Scott. Slager is seen in the video handcuffing Scott after the shooting. Witness: I nearly erased shooting video out of fear. Feidin Santana, the witness who recorded the video, said he didn't see Scott grab Slager's Taser. His account contradicts what Slager told dispatchers. In two interviews with NBC, Santana said that he was walking to his job in North Charleston on Saturday morning when he saw Slager chase Scott, who had been pulled over for a broken taillight. Santana told NBC's Lester Holt on Wednesday that he saw the two men struggling on the ground. "They were down on the (ground)... before I started recording," Santana said. "I remember the police (officer) had control of the situation. He had control of Scott." Santana said he heard the sound of a Taser being used. He believed Scott was trying to get away from it. But Scott never got the Taser or used it on the officer, Santana told NBC. Who was Walter Scott? A North Charleston Police report included brief statements from eight police officers, but not Slager. One officer, identified as Sgt. J. Gann, said in the report he was conducting a separate traffic stop about 9:30 a.m. Saturday when he heard -- apparently via radio -- Slager say he was "in foot pursuit" of another motorist. Gann said that while driving to the officer's location, "Slager advised that he deployed his Taser and (requested) back up units." Seconds later, Gann reported, he heard Slager tell a dispatcher, "Shots fired and the subject is down. He took my Taser." Hours after the shooting, The Post and Courier of Charleston quoted a statement from police spokesman Spencer Pryor, who said Slager attempted to use his Taser to stop a fleeing suspect.  The men struggled over the device, with the suspect taking the Taser and attempting to use it against Slager, the newspaper reported. In the police report, another officer, J. Banias, said he was heading to the scene about 10 minutes after the initial call. Slager asked him to "secure his vehicle at the site of the traffic stop." Banias said he spoke to a passenger in the car Scott was driving. "The passenger was... detained and placed in the back seat of my vehicle," the officer reported. The passenger's identity was not given in the report, but the officer said in the report that the passenger was detained. Scott family spokesman Ryan Julison confirmed to CNN that a man was with Scott and said he is not related to the family. The family declined to provide any more information. A timeline of events. The North Charleston Police Department is not providing additional information, citing an ongoing investigation of Scott's killing by the independent South Carolina Law Enforcement Division. Gann said when he arrived at the shooting scene, an officer identified only as Habersham "was administering first aid" to Scott. "I exited my vehicle and assisted Officer Habersham with first aid and CPR to the driver," Gann said in the report. "We continued to perform first aid and CPR until EMS arrived... When EMS and first responders arrived, EMS took care over providing care to the driver, who was pronounced deceased a short time later." Habersham, in his account, did not mention performing CPR. "I attempted to render aid to the victim by applying pressure to the gunshot wounds and (directing) the best route for EMS and fire to get to the victim faster," he said in the report. An officer identified as Sgt. Webb said that he requested an ambulance. Webb said that at 9:41 a.m. he saw Habersham "administering chest compression to the defendant." North Charleston Police Chief  Eddie Driggers was asked at a news conference this week whether CPR was performed on Scott. "I do not know. I was told that life-saving... that they tried to save his life," Driggers said. North Charleston Mayor Keith Summey added that not every North Charleston police officer is CPR certified. What we know about Officer Slager.

Article: The huge build-up to England women's Under 19 replay against Norway was truly bizarre and unprecedented. And it was a game only supposed to last for 18 seconds. Leah Williamson held incredible nerve to retake a penalty which she ought to have taken on Saturday, were it not for German referee Marjia Kurtes' terrific blunder. Kurtes disallowed Williamson's penalty for encroachment from England players at the weekend, but instead of ordering her back to the spot, awarded a free-kick to Norway. Leah Williamson (centre) stepped up again to take the penalty during the 18-second rematch against Norway. Williamson went the same way as her successful spot-kick last Saturday and found the net once again. Norwegian goalkeeper Oda Marie Hove Bogstad was unable to stop Williamson's brilliant effort. The England captain wheels away in celebration after handing her side a crucial 2-2 draw. But England were given a lifeline when UEFA chiefs ruled it should be replayed. All match details from Saturday, including the time of day the penalty was awarded, the venue, the players who were on the pitch, were ticked off by the Swiss blazers and the game was restarted at 9.45pm. And that was a whole FIVE hours after both had played their final Elite Round games in Northern Ireland. Only Kurtes was replaced, by referee Kateryna Zora. It began in what would have been the 96th minute, and ended 65 seconds later. Leah said: 'They were the longest 24 hours of my life, I hadn't slept. I think I was just excited, I went through so many emotions and just felt excitement, so I thought 'yep, that's how I am going to feel'! 'We had a conversation just before I came out which was quite emotional, we have been through a bigger journey than some people go through in their whole careers because of what happened, it was never about me, it was about the team. The England players celebrate Williamson's penalty which earned them a 2-2 draw in Belfast. England held on in the final moments to secure the draw and, with it, a place in this summer's finals in Israel. Williamson blows a kiss to the crowd as Mo Marley's side look ahead to this summer's tournament. Number of seconds played: 65.18 after the players returned to the centre circle. Number of England players on the pitch: Norway were already down to 10 outfield players, but England brought on a sub to replace one injured in the game vs Switzerland. Days between spot-kicks: Five days between Saturday's clash and the controversial rematch. Number of goals scored: 1 - the infamous penalty. 'When something is taken away from you like that, you realise just how much you want it, and that's what happened. Qualifying is such a huge deal for us, it's massive.' Norway discovered minutes before the penalty was retaken they would qualify for the July finals in Israel, as best runners-up across all Elite Round groups. Had the penalty been missed, Norway would have finished table-toppers, and the Dutch would have progressed as best second-placed team. It was the most surreal football you could imagine, starting from the penalty spot, with none of the regular pomp of a competitive international, yet much more attention than a girls' game normally yields. Under-age women's games in Northern Ireland, if the passionate hosts aren't playing, are usually lucky to attract treble figures. England are awarded a penalty during their European U19 Women's Championships qualifier on Saturday. Referee Marija Kurtes points to the spot as England are awarded a penalty in the 96th minute. Williamson steps up to take a penalty in the closing stages of the match against Norway in Belfast. Williamson runs forward to strike the ball but team-mate Rosella Ayane (circled) has entered the box. Williamson turns and celebrates as she slots the ball into the goalkeeper's bottom-right corner. German referee Marija Kurtes officiating a women's Bundesliga match in Munich last month. England players celebrate after they thought they had equalised against Norway. But referee Kurtes awards an indirect free-kick and the celebrations are cut short. Williamson has the ball back in her hands ready for what she thought would be a retake. While the disgraced Kurtes, who was sent home after her blunder, will be keen to shelve her nightmare, Williamson's name will crop up in pub quizzes for generations. England coach Mo Marley said: 'Obviously the tournament has been tough and pretty much it's about following through in the right way. We are happy we gave ourselves a chance to qualify and everything has turned out the way we wanted it, for Norway as well. 'I know how hard these players have worked, credit to all of the other teams, and credit to Norway, we deserve to be in the finals. 'It's ironic because a lot of the hard work we did at the start of the week was about a long journey, handling the intense pressure of a tournament and tests to our resolve, which helped a lot. But Williamson then realises the referee's decision and two Norwegian players are seen celebrating. German referee Kurtes is understood to have been sent home following her error on Saturday. 'Everyone was aware of the possible outcomes, we may not have scored the penalty, we know that. 'We may not have got through. But we are just so tremendously happy.' Since this odd chain of events stemmed from an infringement of the game's laws, UEFA's disciplinary committee did exactly the right thing in instructing for it to be replayed. But it sets a dangerous precedent. England's appeal cost just £750, which is repayable to the FA as it was successful, but was it lodged just because it's arguably a lower level of football? It triggers questions concerning how many more appeals of this nature could happen in the future. In a men's senior England international, one presumes one of the tens of thousands of people would correct the referee, whereas perhaps the same can't be guaranteed with a three-figure crowd. Indeed, would you have that inexcusable refereeing in the first place? September 2005 - World Cup qualifier - Uzbekistan vs Bahrain. Uzbekistan had won the opening leg of the Asian zone fourth-round play-off 1-0 at home but were left incensed after a penalty was disallowed in the 38th minute for an attacking player encroaching. Rather than retaking the penalty, an indirect free-kick was wrongly awarded by Japanese referee Toshimitsu Yoshida to Bahrain and the game ended with a one-goal margin. Uzbekistan called for an investigation but were left furious after FIFA ordered the match to be replayed in its entirety with the result declared invalid. It proved to have a major impact as it was Bahrain who eventually went through with a 1-1 away goals victory, though they were later beaten in the AFC-CONCACAF play-off. Bahrain staff and players celebrate after beating Uzbekistan in an Asian World Cup qualifier in 2005.

Article: (CNN)Kanye West has settled a lawsuit with a paparazzi photographer he assaulted -- and the two have shaken on it. The photographer, Daniel Ramos, had filed the civil suit against West  after the hip-hop star attacked him and tried to wrestle his camera from him in July 2013 at Los Angeles International Airport. West pleaded no contest last year to a misdemeanor count of battery over the scuffle. A judge sentenced him to two years' probation, as well as anger management sessions and community service. Ramos and his lawyer, Gloria Allred, sought general and punitive damages in the civil suit, saying that West had interfered with the photographer's rights to pursue a lawful occupation. The case had been set for trial next week, but Allred issued a statement Tuesday night saying Ramos' side had filed a dismissal "because the case was settled to the satisfaction of the parties." She didn't disclose the details of the settlement other than saying that "one important aspect of it was an apology by Kanye West to our client, Daniel Ramos." Her statement included a picture of West and Ramos shaking hands, which she said happened after the apology. The original incident was caught on video, including the following exchange. "Kanye! Kanye! Talk to me, Kanye!" Ramos shouts outside a terminal at the Los Angeles airport on the night of July 19, 2013. "What's' going on? Why can't we talk to you?  I mean, why?" he asks as West moves through a group of paparazzi. "Now come on, Kanye, I don't want to fight with you," he says as West advances toward him. "I told you, don't talk to me, right," West says. "You're trying to get me in trouble so I step off and have to pay you like $250,000." West is then seen rushing the photographer and attempting to wrestle his camera from his hands. West retreats after about 15 seconds of scuffling with the photographer. "We believe that this case sent an important message," Allred said. "Celebrities are not above the law, and they have no right to physically attack someone simply because they were asked a question." Beverly Hills Police investigated an incident in January 2014 in which West was accused of assaulting a man at a Beverly Hills chiropractor's office. West avoided criminal charges by reaching a civil settlement with the man. Kanye West apologizes to Beck, Bruno Mars. CNN's Sonya Hamasaki contributed to this report.

Article: Manchester United players hung a fake bird above Ashley Young's peg in the dressing room after a bird pooed in his mouth during a top-flight match, Luke Shaw has revealed. As United kicked off their Premier League season with a match against  Swansea in August, Young received a surprise delivery from a bird mid-match, much to the amusement of his team-mates, who took advantage of the situation. Speaking exclusively to Match of the Day magazine, Shaw said: 'Ashley Young is the joker in the dressing room. We still laugh about the time he got bird poo in his mouth against Swansea. Manchester United left back Luke Shaw (second left) trains at the club's Aon Complex on Friday. Shaw admits that Ashley Young is the biggest joker in the Manchester United dressing room. He says the players still laugh at the time Young got bird poo in his mouth during a match against Swansea. 'If you ask him now, he'll say it wasn't bird poo. In the changing room we hung a fake bird above his place as a joke which he didn't like.' Shaw's revelations come as he nears the end of his first season at Old Trafford. His transition from Southampton star to £31.5million United man has been more difficult than he would have liked, with the left back making just 17 appearances this season. He has suffered a number of injuries, limiting his time on the pitch, but still appears to have settled into his new surroundings well. He admits he picks up tips from goalkeeper David de Gea, who has been in impressive form on the pitch for Louis van Gaal's side. According to Shaw, he is not just a top goalkeeper, but is approachable off the pitch when players need advice too. According to Shaw, United goalkeeper David de Gea is the 'nicest guy in football' and is always approachable. Louis van Gaal's stern demeanour is not limited to the touchline; at training he is equally as focused. Shaw has struggled with a number of injuries since arriving at Manchester United from Southampton. 'David de Gea is funny, he’s kind, if you want to talk to him you can talk to him – he’s the nicest guy in football! 'He’s been unbelievable for us this season and kept us in so many games, he’s starting to become the best goalkeeper in the world.” 'We’ve got a few Spanish-speaking players and they’re always playing their music and dancing around – the English lads hate it. Sometimes we can’t understand them, they say stuff to us and we’re like ‘What?’” After a disappointing campaign under David Moyes last season, Shaw's arrival coincided with that of Van Gaal, who has turned things around at Old Trafford. Now, United look certain to be heading towards a top-four finish, and Shaw admits that Van Gaal's pitch-side focus isn't limited to match-days; at training he is just as stern. 'The manager is always focused on his job, and his job is to win games. I haven’t seen a cheeky side to him yet, but you could say he has one. 'When we’re on the training pitch it’s like a game day, 100 per cent focus, nothing will change his mind or his focus, he’s always on the ball.'

Article: (CNN)"A long, long, time ago..." Those five words, when uttered or sung, makes baby boomers immediately think of Don McLean's pop masterpiece "American Pie."  It's hard to believe that his phenomenal 8½ minute allegory, which millions of Americans know by heart, is 44 years old.  All sorts of historical cross-currents play off each other in this timeless song, brilliantly gilded with the unforgettable chorus, which starts as "Bye, Bye, Miss American Pie." There is no real way to categorize McLean's "American Pie" for its hybrid of modern poetry and folk ballad, beer-hall chant and high-art rock. On Tuesday, Christie's sold the 16-page handwritten manuscript of the song's lyrics for $1.2 million to an unnamed buyer. McLean was a paperboy when, on February 3, 1959, he saw that Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and J.P. "The Big Bopper" Richardson had been tragically killed in an airplane crash in Clear Lake, Iowa. "The next day I went to school in shock and guess what?" McLean recalled.  "Nobody cared.  Rock 'n' roll in those days was sort of like hula hoops and Buddy hadn't had a big hit on the charts since '57."  By cathartically writing "American Pie," McLean has guaranteed that the memory of those great musicians lives forever. Having recorded his first album, "Tapestry," in 1969, in Berkeley, California, during the student riots, McLean, a native New Yorker, became a kind of weather vane for what he called the "generation lost in space."   When his cultural anthem "American Pie" was released in November 1971, it replaced Bob Dylan's "The Times They Are A Changin" as the Peoples Almanac of the new decade.  It's important to think of "American Pie" as one would of Henry Longfellow's "Evangeline" or Johnny Mercer's "Moon River" -- an essential Americana poem emanating wistful recollection, blues valentine, and youthful protest rolled into one.  There is magic brewing in the music and words of "American Pie," for McLean's lyrics and melody frame a cosmic dream, like those Jack Kerouac tried to conjure in his poetry-infused novel "On the Road." Don McLean: Buddy Holly, rest in peace. Influenced by Pete Seeger and the Weavers, McLean proudly wore the mantle of troubadour in the early 1970s, when "American Pie" topped the Billboard charts, and has never shed the cape.   Wandering far and wide, singing "American Pie" at windblown dance halls in Wyoming and cloistered colleges in New England, at huge amphitheaters in California and little coffee houses in the Hudson River Valley, McLean has performed his global anthem thousands of times.  Yet the encore number never loses its transfixing allure. When McLean prods audiences by rhapsodizing "and they were singing" everybody spontaneously joins in with the "Bye, Bye" chorus.  Watching McLean deliver his most notable song in concert is to take part in a collective Happening. What makes "American Pie" so unusual is that it isn't a relic from the counterculture but a talisman, which, like a sacred river, keeps bringing joy to listeners everywhere.  When "American Pie" suddenly is played on a jukebox or radio it's almost impossible not to sing along.   Like "Danny Boy" or "Streets of Laredo" or "Shenandoah," it's eternal.  With illusions to football fields and rock 'n' roll, river levees and nursery rhymes, the song cascades along like a boat going down Niagara Falls or a roller coaster that jumps tracks but floats instead of crashes. After all these years, "American Pie" still makes me feel empowered and yet filled with a sense of loss.  The song is alive and joyful, yet fretful about a world gone wrong.  It is a song that will never die.  A reverie for the ages.   There is a jump to the chorus, which forces the mind to relive the '50s, '60s and '70s, to troll through the back pages of our lives while, like a traditional Irish folksong, it reminds us of fate. While McLean, the muse, has rightfully not tried to interpret "American Pie," it's fair to surmise that "the king" is Elvis Presley, "Helter Skelter" refers to the Charles Manson murders, the "jester on the sidelines in a cast" is Bob Dylan, and "Jack Flash" the Rolling Stones.  But who knows?  The lyric remains a puzzle open to thousands of spirited interpretations.  As a literary artifact of the early 1970s, there isn't anything to compare to "American Pie." Normally, I don't like rankings of literature or songs or even presidents, for that matter.  But the fact that the Recording Industry of America and the National Endowment of the Arts chose "American Pie" as the fifth greatest song of the 20th century speaks to the composition's importance as an enduring piece of pop art.  The other four were "Over the Rainbow" (by Harold Arlen and E.Y "Yip" Harburg), "White Christmas "(by Irving Berlin), "This Land is Your Land" (by Woody Guthrie) and "Respect" (by Otis Redding).  That is fine company. Quite simply, "American Pie" is one of the greatest songs ever written.  And Tuesday the original lyrics found a new home.

Article: Whether it is through Sir Bradley Wiggins, Geraint Thomas or Ian Stannard, Ireland's classics king Sean Kelly believes the time has come for Team Sky to break their duck in one of cycling's Monuments. With the two major cobbled classics - the Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix - looming large over the next two weekends, it is time to see the early results of Sir Dave Brailsford's move to put more emphasis on the Spring Classics in his second five-year plan for Team Sky. With Wiggins electing to sign off his Team Sky career with an appearance at Paris-Roubaix on April 12, the races are bound to be a big part of the team's season whatever the outcome. British Bradley Wiggins competes during the  the Gent-Wevelgem one day cycling race on March 29. The shift in emphasis has already paid dividends in the early part of the season, with Stannard defending his title at Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, Team Sky's third victory in the Belgian race, while Thomas last week won E3 Harelbeke - a key warm-up for this weekend's Tour of Flanders. Kelly, whose record of nine Monument wins puts him in a tie for third all-time, likes what he sees from Team Sky as the big races approach. 'Right now they're looking really good,' Kelly said. 'They've been very impressive in the semi-classics. Can they finish it off by winning a big one?' Team Sky's focus on the Grand Tours up to now has left them short of riders equipped to win classics, while the usually chaotic nature of the races is anathema to their favoured controlling tactics. But the development of Stannard and Thomas gives Team Sky two in-house contenders, while Wiggins raised eyebrows with his ninth-placed finish in Paris-Roubaix last year and he vowed to return. Luke Rowe could also be another British option for the team. Ian Stannard (3rd from front) rides in the Gent-Wevelgem one-day cycling race on March 29. Injuries to classics specialists Fabian Cancellara (Trek Factory) and Tom Boonen (Etixx-QuickStep) - although the latter may return in time for Paris-Roubaix - add to the impression that Team Sky's best chance may be now. 'Without Cancellara, without Boonen, it's going to be a more open race,' said Kelly, who will commentate on both the Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix for Eurosport. 'There's going to be eight-10 guys saying they can win and Sky have three of them. Geraint is certainly in there, Stannard is maybe a little bit under his best after his crash (in the first Monument, Milan-San Remo on March 22) but can come back, and then of course there is Wiggins.' Of the three, Wiggins is yet to show the sort of form this season which suggests he can win Paris-Roubaix, but Kelly is not counting the 2012 Tour de France winner out, saying a Monument win to add to his Tour and world time trial success would elevate Wiggins to 'another level'. 'If you look at the way he's performing at the moment, for me, it's not as good as I would like him to be in the recent races, but you can't go to Paris-Roubaix with only one card to play,' Kelly said. Geraint Thomas celebrates placing third in the Belgian cycling classic Ghent-Wevelgem. 'With Thomas and Stannard as well, you play all of those cards and the rest look after them. If you can get to the final 10-12km and Wiggins is still there, that is where he can go on the attack.' To get to that point, Team Sky will need to be in survival mode in a usually attritional race known as 'the Hell of the North'. The brutal cobbled stretches, which require huge amounts of effort while increasing the chances of crashes and mechanical problems, create a nervousness in the peloton which makes planning all but impossible. Although Kelly never won the Tour of Flanders, finishing second in 1984, he was victorious in Paris-Roubaix twice, 1984 and 1986, and said the fear of the cobbles is something that never really left him. 'When I first went there I had a horrendous time - I was very nervous on the cobbles and I wasn't able to ride them well,' he said. 'I slowly developed and I was able to manage to ride them, but even when I got to the point of being a Paris-Roubaix favourite it's still very nervous times. 'It's a horrible race to ride, but a great race to win.'

Team Sky have never won one of cycling's five Monument races. The Tour of Flanders takes place next weekend with Ian Stannard and Geraint Thomas contenders fro Team Sky. Sean Kelly has backed them to finally break their duck.

Former Australian spin bowler Shane Warne penned a heartfelt tribute on social media calling him the 'Godfather of cricket'. 'As a cricketer, commentator and as a person, you were the best there's ever been,' he wrote in a note to Benaud. 'For me it was an honour and a privilege to call you a close friend and mentor.

Floral tributes have started to gather at the bronze statue of Richie Benaud at the Sydney Cricket Ground. The flags at the Sydney Cricket Ground were flying at half mast on Friday following Benaud's death. As a player, Benaud was a trailblazing all-rounder who took 248 wickets and scored 2,201 runs in 63 Tests while never losing a series in charge of his country. He enjoyed a remarkable Test career as a wily leg-spin bowler and middle-order batsman which ended with his retirement in 1964. Benaud scored three Test centuries and once hit 11 sixes in a first class innings. After retiring, Benaud became a commentary icon initially with the BBC in England and later in his native Australia. In a broadcast career spanning more than five decades, he was instrumental in establishing one-day cricket on television. Such was influence, his dry one-liners and impeccable delivery - including one simple word'marvellous' - were adopted as part of the Australian lexicon. He was the mainstay in Australian cricket television commentary until the past two summers - a car accident in 2013 sidelined him before he announced in November last year he had skin cancer. At the time of his death, Benaud had witnessed - as both player and commentator - well over 500 Test matches. Benaud was born in Penrith in western Sydney in October 1930. Warne also thanked Benaud for the support he gave to him as a young cricketer. 'Richie, you were loved by everyone, not just the cricket family, you were the godfather of cricket and you will be missed by all.' Australian Test captain Michael Clarke said Benaud was a gentleman who played cricket in the right spirit. 'He was a great player and a great captain; a wonderful leader of men and he continued that off the field,' Clarke told the Nine Network. 'Our country has lost a national treasure,' Cricket Australia chairman Wally Edwards said in a statement on Friday. 'After Don Bradman, there has been no Australian player more famous or more influential than Richie Benaud.' 'He loved winning. He helped the Australian team have the attitude where they wanted to win. He played the game the right way. 'There's no doubt he's certainly going to be missed.' Prime Minister David Cameron said: 'I grew up listening to Richie Benaud's wonderful cricket commentary. Like all fans of the sport, I will miss him very much.' Former Australian fast bowler Brett Lee said: 'When Richie walks into the Channel Nine box everyone stands up. 'When Richie was on, you'd see all the commentators listening in to see what Richie had to say. 'A lot of children growing up know him as a commentator but he's a great cricketer in his own right.'

A veteran of 63 Test matches, Benaud played a pivotal role in the formation of World Series Cricket in the 1970s and was one of the world's most recognised commentators. Benaud was the face and voice of cricket, much admired, much imitated, and in his later years  a cult figure. Former Prime Minister John Howard greeted Richie Benaud at the Sydney Cricket Ground back in 2001. Benaud and ex-Hampshire cricket captain and TV presenter Richie Benaud pictured here at Sophia Gardens in Cardiff during the first England v Australia Test match in 2009. 'There would hardly be an Australian over the last 40 years who hasn't listened to Richie Benaud,' he told ABC radio on Friday. 'He certainly will be very, very much missed.' Benaud had anchored the Nine Network's cricket coverage in Australia for decades. 'Richie Benaud's passing has robbed us not only of a national treasure but a lovely man,' Nine Network CEO David Gyngell said in a statement. 'Richie earned the profound and lasting respect of everyone across the world of cricket and beyond. First as an outstanding player and captain, then as an incomparable commentator and through it all, as a wonderful human being.'

He enjoyed a remarkable Test career as a wily leg-spin bowler and middle-order batsman which ended with his retirement in 1964. Benaud was the first player to score 2,000 Test runs and take 200 Test wickets yet was as much renowned for his captaincy - he never lost a Test series as Australian captain.

He was the mainstay in Australian cricket television commentary until the past two summers - a car accident in 2013 sidelined him before he announced in November last year he had skin cancer. As a player, Benaud appeared in 63 Test matches between 1951 and 1963, becoming the first man from any nation to score 2000 Test runs and take 200 Test wickets.

Penrith-born Benaud enjoyed a remarkable Test career as a wily leg-spin bowler and middle-order batsman which ended with his retirement in 1964. 'When I was a kid we never ever wore a cap... because Keith Miller never wore a cap,'Benaud said at the time. 'If I knew, when I was at school and playing in my early cricket days, the problems that would have come if I didn't do something about protection of the head and using sunscreens and all sorts of things like that, I'd have played it differently. 'It's one of those things in life: you live and learn as you go along.' Benaud did, however, manage to voice a touching tribute to Phillip Hughes, who died when struck by a bouncer last November, which was screened before Australia's Test series against India last December. Hundreds of admirers dressed up as the legendary commentator during the Sydney Ashes Test of 2014 when Benaud lay in hospital with complications from a serious car accident some months earlier.

His Australian record Test tally of 248 wickets has since been overtaken by many, most notably fellow legspinner Shane Warne, whose career tally of 708 was unimaginable in Benaud's day. Benaud scored three Test centuries and once hit 11 sixes in a first class innings. Shane Warne penned a heartfelt tribute to Richie Benaud on social media on Friday. As captain he led Australia to four consecutive series victories, beginning with a 4-0 demolition of Peter May's 1958-59 tourists (Benaud took 31 wickets in the five tests). He never lost a series as captain. The Nine Network will air a special on the life of cricketing great Richie Benaud on Saturday night at 7pm.

Article: (CNN)That's some rich "American Pie." The lyrics to the famed Don McLean song sold for $1.2 million Tuesday morning at an auction held by Christie's. "Don McLean's manuscript of 'American Pie' achieved the 3rd highest auction price for an American literary manuscript, a fitting tribute to one the foremost singer-songwriters of his generation," Christie's Tom Lecky said in a statement. McLean told Rolling Stone that it was time to part with the manuscript. "I'm going to be 70 this year," the singer and songwriter said in February. "I have two children and a wife, and none of them seem to have the mercantile instinct. I want to get the best deal that I can for them. It's time." Over the years, "American Pie" has become one of the most dissected and argued-about songs in the pop music canon. McLean has said that the opening lines were inspired by the death of Buddy Holly, but after that, it's all been conjecture -- which hasn't stopped a marching band's worth of analysts from trying to parse the symbols in the 8-minute, 33-second opus. Is the jester Bob Dylan? The football game Vietnam? The "girl who sang the blues" Janis Joplin? (One thing's certain: Buddy Holly's plane was NOT named "American Pie.") "Over the years I've dealt with all these stupid questions of 'Who's that?' and 'Who's that?' " McLean said. "These are things I never had in my head for a second when I wrote the song. I was trying to capture something very ephemeral and I did, but it took a long time." The song catapulted the former folk singer to headliner status. The song hit No. 1 in early 1972, despite its length. (The 45-rpm single split the song in half on its A and B sides.) The draft that was auctioned is 16 pages: 237 lines of manuscript and 26 lines of typed text, according to Christie's. It includes lines that didn't make the final version as well as extensive notes -- all of which should be revealing, McLean said. The record for a popular music manuscript is held by Bob Dylan's "Like a Rolling Stone," which sold for $2 million in June. Opinion: What's so great about 'American Pie'?

Article: A woman who suffered stomach cramps and bleeding for two years was horrified to be told it was due to a tumour the size of a golf ball in her cervix. Kerry Hamilton was finally diagnosed with leiomyosarcoma, a rare cancer of the soft tissue normally found in women over 50. At just 34, she was forced to undergo a hysterectomy and was devastated at the thought of not being able to have children. She now wants to raise awareness about rare cancers like leiomyosarcoma, so that other women with seemingly 'everyday' symptoms like cramps visit their GP. Kerry Hamilton, 34, had stomach cramps, bleeding and irregular periods for two years. Doctors finally discovered she had a tumour the size of a golf ball growing in her cervix. Ms Hamilton, an education consultant, began experiencing odd symptoms in 2009, when she flew to South Africa to volunteer at a lion research centre for a month (pictured) Since her time in South Africa (pictured) she had experienced spotting in between her periods, longer periods than normal and stomach cramps. Ms Hamilton, from Birmingham, said: 'I'm on a bid to raise awareness about rare cancers and the symptoms that people might ignore - without realising that it is important to listen to their body. 'The kind of cancer I had - despite it being in my cervix - would not have showed up on a smear test. 'So it's important to visit your GP if you're concerned about anything, as well as always going for routine tests.' Ms Hamilton, an education consultant, began experiencing odd symptoms in 2009, when she flew to South Africa to volunteer at a lion research centre for a month. A week before she was due to fly home she fell violently ill with stomach cramps. She spent seven days in hospital where a local doctor told her that she was suffering with a cyst on her ovaries that had burst. Leiomyosarcomas are cancers that develop in a type of muscle tissue called smooth muscle. These muscles are found in the walls of muscular organs like the heart and the stomach. They are rare and usually only affect people over the age of 50, but they can start anywhere in the body. They most commonly start in the walls of the womb, the limbs and the digestive system. People with early leiomyosarcoma often have no symptoms. Possible. symptoms to develop as the cancer advances include a lump or swelling,. abdominal bloating, swelling or pain and a change in menstruation. Source: Macmillan Cancer Support. Over the next two years she returned to the park to work as a guide and a ranger and later returned to the UK where she started working as an educational consultant. When she returned, she went for a routine smear test in 2011 and was given the all clear. Ever since being hospitalised in South Africa she had experienced spotting in between her periods, longer periods than normal and stomach cramps. By last summer these symptoms had become worse and intense pain and lots of bleeding. Her GP suggested it was a hormonal problem and that she go on the contraceptive pill to try and control it. But as she was single, Ms Hamilton didn't see the point of using a contraceptive and felt uneasy about taking hormonal treatment. She also didn't want to ignore the signals her body was giving her, and so never took the contraceptives that were prescribed. It was only in January this year, when she was called for her next smear test, that she was finally diagnosed. The nurse due to carry out the smear said her cervix was so irritated that it was impossible to conduct the test. Ms Hamilton, pictured in 2009, became aware something was seriously wrong when a nurse couldn't perform a smear test on her as there was so much inflammation. Doctors diagnosed Ms Hamilton with a leiomyosarcoma  - a cancer of the soft tissue, the muscle, fat, blood vessels, or any of the other tissues that support, surround and protect the organs of the body. She then broke the devastating news that she suspected Ms Hamilton had cancer. After an MRI scan, doctors confirmed she had leiomyosarcoma and would need a hysterectomy to save her life. A leiomyosarcoma is a cancer of the soft tissue, the muscle, fat, blood vessels, or any of the other tissues that support, surround and protect the organs of the body. Ms Hamilton's was found in the walls of her cervix. Only about 3,300 new cases of soft tissue cancers are diagnosed each year in the UK, and they mainly affect people over the age of 50. Ms Hamilton described the shock of being told she may never be able to become pregnant naturally. 'This was going to be the year I was going to go out and meet someone and start to think about having a family. 'But now I wouldn't be able to carry a child. 'I couldn't believe that I had cancer in my cervix for all that time.' Ms Hamilton underwent a hysterectomy at just 34-and was devastated at the thought of not being able to carry a child. But she remained positive, saying 'there is somebody else going through much worse' She underwent egg collection so that one day she might have a child that is biologically hers. On March 19th this year she underwent the operation to remove her womb – and the tumour – and is now recovering at home. While many women would become disheartened after such an ordeal, Ms Hamilton said she believes. She said: 'Luckily I am a naturally positive person, and I just think that there is somebody else going through something much worse than me. 'When I was finally diagnosed it was more of a relief than anything to know what was wrong. 'It was when I was told that I would need a hysterectomy that when it hit me, and I became really upset.' Even before she had cancer, Ms Hamilton ran the Race for Life for Cancer Research UK, and this year raising money for the charity will be more meaningful than ever. She said: 'I have done the race the last two years, and I always said I would do it every year, so this year I'm on a mission. 'I've already raised £1,600 which is so amazing and humbling.'

Article: (CNN)You may know Mindy Kaling from Fox's cult hit comedy "The Mindy Project," in which she plays Mindy Lahiri, a perky, quirky OB/GYN juggling her career and love life in New York. (Only in the Big Apple can a doctor not afford an apartment!) The show was a breakthrough for on-screen representation — the first network sitcom created by and starring a woman of color — and it looks likely to be renewed for the coming 2015-16 season. Recently, however, Kaling's brother Vijay Chokalingam unveiled a project of his own, and while it has been getting a lot of attention, it hasn't generated quite as many laughs — either from observers or from his famous sibling, who told him it brought "shame upon their family." You see, Chokalingam revealed that, as an undergraduate at the University of Chicago, he engaged in a daring (his view) or ridiculous and offensive (pretty much everyone else) scam: He applied to medical school claiming to be African-American. Chokalingam had spent his college years as a "hard-partying frat boy," and achieved a less than stunning 3.1 GPA. Upon facing graduation and exploring his med school options, he realized that fellow Indian-Americans with his grades were getting turned down from the universities of his choice — but that "black, Hispanic, and Native American applicants with my grades and test scores were much more likely to gain acceptance." This revelation led him to make the decision to pose as a black man, both to "dramatically improve" his chances of admission, and to illustrate the unfair advantage that blacks and other underrepresented minorities receive when applying to prestigious schools. To accomplish this goal, Chokalingam shaved his head of its naturally wavy black locks, trimmed his "long Indian-American eyelashes," checked "black" under the optional race/ethnicity declaration and submitted his application to 14 schools under his childhood nickname "JoJo." He received invitations for in-person interviews at 11 schools, results that he claims support the notion that African-Americans garner special privileges that are unavailable to whites or Asians. And now that the statute of limitations on his act of fraud has expired, he's looking to write a book on his experiences, titled "Almost Black: The True Story of an Indian American Who Got Into Medical School Pretending to Be an African American." What's truly curious is that even if you agree with Chokalingam that affirmative action is merely a form of "systematic racism," when all is said and done, it offers very little evidence of the "privilege" that he claims is accorded to black, Hispanic and Native American candidates. Chokalingam had mediocre grades and MCATs, but he graduated from one of the most prestigious schools in the nation. Yet even while representing himself as black, Chokalingam received only a single admission offer, to St. Louis University's School of Medicine, which falls somewhere between 57th and 67th in national rankings. Harvard, University of Pennsylvania, Columbia and all the higher ranked schools he applied to rejected him. Meanwhile, he admits, pretending to be black came with disadvantages. He found himself being accused of shoplifting by store clerks and harassed by cops — who would regularly stop him while driving and demand that he tell them how much his car cost, implying that he must have stolen it. These acts of very real prejudice, experienced regularly by blacks and Hispanics of all backgrounds — multimillionaire comedian Chris Rock has recently been tweeting pictures of the occasions when he is pulled over by police for no reason — didn't seem to dissuade Chokalingam from his adamant belief in the unfairness of a system that seeks to address the shockingly low numbers of minority health practitioners by providing some weight to race and ethnicity in decision-making. It's not just a matter of what individual applicants "deserve." One-third of Americans are black, Hispanic or Native American; just one in 10 physicians are. Since minority medical practitioners are up to three times as likely to practice in their own communities, this lack of diversity has produced "doctor deserts," in which urban and rural ethnic enclaves across the nation go without access to primary care physicians. Years ago, when I told my father — a doctor from a long line of doctors — that I didn't want to follow in his footsteps, he told me that was fine, because medicine is a service trade, and anyone not interested in serving should avoid the profession. A medical degree isn't a reward to be earned, he said, but a responsibility to be accepted. Which really cuts to the heart of what's so sad about Chokalingam's racial farce. Like others who've recently been exposed for falsely claiming racial identities — including putative presidential candidate Jeb Bush, who registered himself as "Hispanic" on a 2009 voter form, and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who was excoriated during her campaign for having claimed Native American ancestry in the past — Chokalingam wanted to claim the fruits of racial affiliation without having to carry black people's burden. Race isn't just about color or blood; it is about the collective experiences and inherited cultural context and present-day condition of a community of people. Many of the markers of race are persistently corrosive; others are deeply painful. Affirmative action programs are a means of redress for these awful realities of our nation's history; an imperfect one, but necessary. There are some fields where the imbalances might never correct themselves on their own. Industries like health care and Hollywood. Because what's most ironic about Chokalingam's decision to ride on his sister's coattails in telling his story: While Asians are well represented in medicine, our numbers are vanishingly low in the entertainment and media world, and until the recent breakthrough of modern pioneers like Mindy Kaling, it was impossible to imagine film and television that included our faces, voices and stories. Kaling's immense talent and charisma made her a star. But it was a quota-based affirmative action initiative -- NBC's Diversity Writers Program -- that gave her a start.

Article: Hibs, Hearts and Rangers united in condemnation of the SPFL's decision to move the Ibrox club's final game of the Championship season back 24 hours. In a move designed to accommodate broadcasters, Rangers will face champions Hearts at Tynecastle on May 3 — 24 hours after Hibs and promotion rivals Falkirk and Queen of the South play. Adamant the final round of fixtures should be played at the same time to avert any competitive advantage for Stuart McCall's side, Easter Road chief executive Leanne Dempster and Hearts chairwoman Ann Budge have lodged formal complaints with the league. In a staggering misjudgment of the public mood, however, the SPFL issued a statement expressing surprise at the fuss before Rangers boss McCall compounded their woe by revealing he also backed Hibs' stance. Hibernian are upset that Rangers' final game of the season has been pushed back for TV purposes. Ramping up the pressure on SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster, Hibs counterpart Leanne Dempster said: 'In previous seasons, the League has ensured that all of the final round fixtures are played at the same time. 'I have been in contact with the SPFL following its announcement that one final-round fixture would kick off after all the other results are known. 'I have reminded them in very clear terms that — as organisers of the competition — the responsibility for protecting its unimpeachable sporting integrity lies with them.' On a day when the relationship between broadcasters and Scottish football came under unprecedented scrutiny, Hearts majority shareholder Budge backed up her city rivals. In a statement, Budge also queried the'sporting integrity' of Rangers playing 24 hours after their rivals given they are engaged in a dogfight with Hibs for second place. 'This has been done following selection of the game for a live TV broadcast,' she said. 'While we all knew that this was likely to be a strong candidate for televising and that the time might well change, we did not for one minute think that at this late stage, it would be moved to the Sunday, especially given our belief that all Championship games would require to be played at the same time. 'On learning of the change, I immediately attempted to contact the SPFL and objected in strong terms to the proposed late change to this fixture on the grounds of it having a total disregard for the interests of supporters of both clubs and an apparent disregard for sporting integrity. Rangers will play Hearts at Tynecastle in their final game of the season on May 3. 'Being given 17 days' notice of this change is extremely disruptive and potentially very expensive for the fans, the sponsors and indeed the club. Overseas supporters have been in touch to advise that they will lose substantial amounts on travel; others have advised of lost earnings, holiday problems, etc. 'None of this is good for any of us and on behalf of the club, I can only apologise. 'When it also became apparent to us that our fixture was the only game to be moved, we were equally alarmed as rightly or wrongly, this casts a shadow over the sporting integrity of the Championship. 'While it may not be enshrined in the newly-merged rulebook of the SPFL, it is protocol the football world over for fixtures such as the last day of the Championship to be played simultaneously. 'To move only one, (or even two or four) out of 5 fixtures would seem to be leaving our game wide open to unsavoury accusations. 'I will be sending in a formal complaint to the SPFL in relation to this appallingly late decision. It is no wonder that clubs are finding it harder and harder to gain support from their fans when their interests can be so blatantly disregarded, especially at such short notice. 'I am advised that this complaint will likely have no impact on the original decision but nevertheless, I want our supporters to know that we have taken all and any action that we could have and I will further comment on the situation once we have been updated by the League.' Responding to the criticism, however, the SPFL rushed out a statement saying it was 'unreasonable' to expect all Championship games to kick off simultaneously. 'In response to recent criticisms of the Championship fixture scheduling for the weekend 2/3 May, we'd like to clarify some specific points. On this weekend, the Hearts v Rangers match is scheduled for Sunday 3 May to be broadcast on television and it is not clear to us why this has caused so much surprise. This is a key game in the Championship season and will inevitably attract huge interest from fans around the world. Hearts are already promoted from the Championship, but they too condemned the fixture change. 'It is unreasonable to expect all Championship fixtures that weekend to move to the Sunday when a number of them will be unaffected by the Hearts v Rangers tie. However, as a result of this fixture, all Championship clubs have been invited to submit a request should they wish to move games to the Sunday. 'To date, we have had no request from Hibernian FC to move its fixture to the Sunday at the time of writing (8.45pm, Wednesday 15 April). 'We also note speculation that Police Scotland expressed concern to the SPFL about the scheduling of the Hearts v Rangers match. However, Police Scotland confirmed to us that there were no security issues with the scheduling of all Championship fixtures that weekend. 'Whilst we regret any inconvenience to supporters caused by rescheduled fixtures, the circumstances surrounding the matches on the weekend of 2/3 May are in no way unusual.' After his side drew with Livingston last night, however, Ibrox manager McCall gave his view, saying: 'First and foremost, we've not asked for the game to be changed. Hibs are complaining about it and rightly so. I'd be doing exactly the same. I think every game on the last day of the season should be played at the same time. 'But we've told by the TV, I believe, that it may be the case that the other games are moved to the Sunday. I honestly don't know. It's nothing to do with us. We've not asked for that, but if I was in Hibs' position then, yes, I would be annoyed as well. Of course. 'I was happy to play on the Saturday. We've not tried to gain any advantage - we've been told when to play. TV controls a lot of things. If the game definitely has to go ahead on the Sunday then can we all then move to the Sunday. I'd be happy with that. I would imagine that it will be changed over the next 24 or 48 hours to play at the same time. It would be only right.'

Rangers' final game of the season against Hearts pushed back 24 hours. Ibrox side will face Hearts on May 3 at Tynecastle to accommodate TV. Hibs, Falkirk and Queen of the South play on Saturday May 2. Hibernian adamant final round of fixtures should be played at same time.

Article: (CNN)Buzz has surrounded HBO's new documentary "Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief," but Scientologist John Travolta is not a fan. Travolta told the Tampa Bay Times that he has not seen the documentary, "and I don't really care to." "I've been so happy with my (Scientology) experience in the last 40 years that I really don't have anything to say that would shed light on (a documentary) so decidedly negative," Travolta said. The actor, one of the Church of Scientology's most high-profile members along with stars like Tom Cruise and Kirstie Alley, is premiering his new film, "The Forger," in Clearwater, Florida. The HBO documentary is based on the book "Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief" by Lawrence Wright and is critical of the organization, which has close ties to the showbiz industry. Travolta said he believed the doc was a result of "people who were disgruntled with their experiences" with the Church of Scientology, which he touted as a positive experience for him. "I haven't experienced anything that the hearsay has (claimed), so why would I communicate something that wasn't true for me?" Travolta asked. "It wouldn't make sense, nor would it for Tom (Cruise), I imagine." He called Scientology "brilliant" and credited the church with helping him to survive the death of his teen son, Jett, after a seizure while the family was on vacation in the Bahamas in 2009. "Oh, my God, I wouldn't have made it," said Travolta, whose wife, Kelly Preston, is also a member. "Honestly."

Spanish midfielder Herrera will be hoping to continue the fine form that has seen him become one of United's key players recently. While midfielder Ashley Young is also desperate to bring an end to their wretched recent run against Manchester City. He said: 'We know it will be tough but as long as we can play the way we have shown, especially in the last few games, and add to that, it's going to be a great game and hopefully we will get the three points. 'We want to keep the momentum going and the positive play. It would be nice (to finish above City) but we are just taking each game as it comes. It is obviously going to be another tough one against City next week but we will prepare as well as we can do as we always do.'

Article: (CNN)Anthony Ray Hinton is thankful to be free after nearly 30 years on Alabama's death row for murders he says he didn't commit. And incredulous that it took so long. Hinton, 58, looked up, took in the sunshine and thanked God and his lawyers Friday morning outside the county jail in Birmingham, minutes after taking his first steps as a free man since 1985. He spoke of unjustly losing three decades of his life, under fear of execution, for something he didn't do. "All they had to do was to test the gun, but when you think you're high and mighty and you're above the law, you don't have to answer to nobody," Hinton told reporters. "But I've got news for you -- everybody that played a part in sending me to death row, you will answer to God." Jefferson County Circuit Court Judge Laura Petro had ordered Hinton released after granting the state's motion to dismiss charges against him. Hinton was convicted of murder in the 1985 deaths of two Birmingham-area, fast-food restaurant managers, John Davidson and Thomas Wayne Vason. But a new trial was ordered in 2014 after firearms experts testified 12 years earlier that the revolver Hinton was said to have used in the crimes could not be matched to evidence in either case, and the two killings couldn't be linked to each other. "Death Row Stories": Hard questions about the U.S. capital punishment system. The state then declined to re-prosecute the case. Hinton was 29 at the time of the killings and had always maintained his innocence, said the Equal Justice Initiative, a group that helped win his release. "Race, poverty, inadequate legal assistance, and prosecutorial indifference to innocence conspired to create a textbook example of injustice," Bryan Stevenson, the group's executive director and Hinton's lead attorney, said of his African-American client. "I can't think of a case that more urgently dramatizes the need for reform than what has happened to Anthony Ray Hinton." Stevenson said the "refusal of state prosecutors to re-examine this case despite persuasive and reliable evidence of innocence is disappointing and troubling." Amnesty report: Executions down but death sentences on the rise. Dressed in a dark suit and blue shirt, Hinton praised God for his release, saying he was sent "not just a lawyer, but the best lawyers." He said he will continue to pray for the families of the murder victims. Both he and those families have suffered a miscarriage of justice, he said. "For all of us that say that we believe in justice, this is the case to start showing, because I shouldn't have (sat) on death row for 30 years," he said. Woman who spent 22 years on death row has case tossed. Hinton was accompanied Friday by two of his sisters, one of whom still lives in the Birmingham area. Other siblings will fly to the area to see him soon, Stevenson said. His mother, with whom he lived at the time of his arrest, is no longer living, according to the lawyer. Hinton planned to spend at least this weekend at the home of a close friend. He will meet with his attorneys Monday to start planning for his immediate needs, such as obtaining identification and getting a health checkup, Stevenson said. The plan now is to spend a few weeks to get oriented with freedom and "sort out what he wants to do," Stevenson said.

Article: (CNN)Blues legend B.B. King was hospitalized for dehydration, though the ailment didn't keep him out for long. King's dehydration was caused by his Type II diabetes, but he "is much better," his daughter, Claudette King, told the Los Angeles Times. The legendary guitarist and vocalist released a statement thanking those who have expressed their concerns. "I'm feeling much better and am leaving the hospital today," King said in a message Tuesday. Angela Moore, a publicist for Claudette King, said later in the day that he was back home resting and enjoying time with his grandchildren. "He was struggling before, and he is a trouper," Moore said. "He wasn't going to let his fans down." No more information on King's condition or where he was hospitalized was immediately available. B.B. is short for Blues Boy, part of the name he used as a Memphis disc jockey, the Beale Street Blues Boy. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987, and has 30 Grammy nominations. King, 89, has used various models of Gibson guitars over the years, and named each one of them Lucille. In the 1980s, Gibson officially dropped the model number on the guitar he used last and most. It became a custom-made signature model named Lucille, manufactured exclusively for the "King of the Blues." Some of his hits include "The Thrill Is Gone," which won him his first Grammy in 1970, "There Must be a Better World Somewhere" and "When Love Comes to Town," a collaboration with U2. Last year, the bluesman suffered from dehydration and exhaustion after a show in Chicago, forcing him to cancel the remainder of his tour.

Cricket commentator Richie Benaud has died aged 84 in a Sydney hospice after battling skin cancer. Respected: Benaud died peacefully in his sleep surrounded by his wife Daphne (above) and family members. A veteran of 63 Test matches, Benaud played a key role in the formation of World Series Cricket in the 1970s. A veteran of 63 Test matches, Benaud played a pivotal role in the formation of World Series Cricket in the 1970s and was one of the world's most recognised commentators. In a broadcast career spanning more than five decades, he was instrumental in establishing one-day cricket on television. Such was influence, his dry one-liners and impeccable delivery - including one simple word'marvellous' - were adopted as part of the Australian lexicon. Former Australian spin bowler Shane Warne penned a heartfelt tribute on social media calling him the 'Godfather of cricket'. 'As a cricketer, commentator and as a person, you were the best there's ever been,' he wrote in a note to Benaud. 'For me it was an honour and a privilege to call you a close friend and mentor. 'We had so many wonderful times together, talking cricket and in particular, our love and passion of leg spin bowling. Former  captain Richie Benaud stands by a sculpture of himself at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 2008. Floral tributes have started to gather at the bronze statue of Richie Benaud at the Sydney Cricket Ground. The flags at the Sydney Cricket Ground were flying at half mast on Friday following Benaud's death. As a player, Benaud was a trailblazing all-rounder who took 248 wickets and scored 2,201 runs in 63 Tests while never losing a series in charge of his country. He enjoyed a remarkable Test career as a wily leg-spin bowler and middle-order batsman which ended with his retirement in 1964. Benaud scored three Test centuries and once hit 11 sixes in a first class innings. After retiring, Benaud became a commentary icon initially with the BBC in England and later in his native Australia. In a broadcast career spanning more than five decades, he was instrumental in establishing one-day cricket on television. Such was influence, his dry one-liners and impeccable delivery - including one simple word'marvellous' - were adopted as part of the Australian lexicon. He was the mainstay in Australian cricket television commentary until the past two summers - a car accident in 2013 sidelined him before he announced in November last year he had skin cancer. At the time of his death, Benaud had witnessed - as both player and commentator - well over 500 Test matches. Benaud was born in Penrith in western Sydney in October 1930. Warne also thanked Benaud for the support he gave to him as a young cricketer. 'Richie, you were loved by everyone, not just the cricket family, you were the godfather of cricket and you will be missed by all.' Australian Test captain Michael Clarke said Benaud was a gentleman who played cricket in the right spirit. 'He was a great player and a great captain; a wonderful leader of men and he continued that off the field,' Clarke told the Nine Network. 'Our country has lost a national treasure,' Cricket Australia chairman Wally Edwards said in a statement on Friday. 'After Don Bradman, there has been no Australian player more famous or more influential than Richie Benaud.' 'He loved winning. He helped the Australian team have the attitude where they wanted to win. He played the game the right way. 'There's no doubt he's certainly going to be missed.' Prime Minister David Cameron said: 'I grew up listening to Richie Benaud's wonderful cricket commentary. Like all fans of the sport, I will miss him very much.' Former Australian fast bowler Brett Lee said: 'When Richie walks into the Channel Nine box everyone stands up. 'When Richie was on, you'd see all the commentators listening in to see what Richie had to say. 'A lot of children growing up know him as a commentator but he's a great cricketer in his own right.' Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has offered Richie Benaud's family a state funeral following his death. Benaud was one of the world's most recognised commentators having initially started with the BBC in England before anchoring the Nine Network's cricket coverage in Australia for decades. A veteran of 63 Test matches, Benaud played a pivotal role in the formation of World Series Cricket in the 1970s and was one of the world's most recognised commentators. Benaud was the face and voice of cricket, much admired, much imitated, and in his later years  a cult figure.

'There would hardly be an Australian over the last 40 years who hasn't listened to Richie Benaud,' he told ABC radio on Friday. 'He certainly will be very, very much missed.' Benaud had anchored the Nine Network's cricket coverage in Australia for decades. 'Richie Benaud's passing has robbed us not only of a national treasure but a lovely man,' Nine Network CEO David Gyngell said in a statement. 'Richie earned the profound and lasting respect of everyone across the world of cricket and beyond. First as an outstanding player and captain, then as an incomparable commentator and through it all, as a wonderful human being.' The cricket commentator had been receiving radiation treatment for skin cancer since November when he was admitted to a Sydney hospice on Thursday. Richie Benaud married his wife Daphne in July 1967. At the time of his death in Sydney overnight Benaud had witnessed - as both player and commentator - well over 500 Test matches. Benaud was born in Penrith in western Sydney in October 1930. He enjoyed a remarkable Test career as a wily leg-spin bowler and middle-order batsman which ended with his retirement in 1964. Benaud was the first player to score 2,000 Test runs and take 200 Test wickets yet was as much renowned for his captaincy - he never lost a Test series as Australian captain. After retiring, Benaud became a commentary icon initially with the BBC in England and later in his native Australia. He was the mainstay in Australian cricket television commentary until the past two summers - a car accident in 2013 sidelined him before he announced in November last year he had skin cancer. As a player, Benaud appeared in 63 Test matches between 1951 and 1963, becoming the first man from any nation to score 2000 Test runs and take 200 Test wickets. He enjoyed a remarkable Test career as a wily leg-spin bowler and middle-order batsman which ended with his retirement in 1964. Penrith-born Benaud enjoyed a remarkable Test career as a wily leg-spin bowler and middle-order batsman which ended with his retirement in 1964. 'When I was a kid we never ever wore a cap... because Keith Miller never wore a cap,'Benaud said at the time. 'If I knew, when I was at school and playing in my early cricket days, the problems that would have come if I didn't do something about protection of the head and using sunscreens and all sorts of things like that, I'd have played it differently. 'It's one of those things in life: you live and learn as you go along.' Benaud did, however, manage to voice a touching tribute to Phillip Hughes, who died when struck by a bouncer last November, which was screened before Australia's Test series against India last December. Hundreds of admirers dressed up as the legendary commentator during the Sydney Ashes Test of 2014 when Benaud lay in hospital with complications from a serious car accident some months earlier. Benaud was the mainstay in Australian cricket television commentary with crowd members even dressing up as him as he became something of a cult figure in his later years. As a player, Benaud appeared in 63 Test matches between 1951 and 1963, becoming the first man from any nation to score 2000 Test runs and take 200 Test wickets. His Australian record Test tally of 248 wickets has since been overtaken by many, most notably fellow legspinner Shane Warne, whose career tally of 708 was unimaginable in Benaud's day. Benaud scored three Test centuries and once hit 11 sixes in a first class innings. Shane Warne penned a heartfelt tribute to Richie Benaud on social media on Friday. As captain he led Australia to four consecutive series victories, beginning with a 4-0 demolition of Peter May's 1958-59 tourists (Benaud took 31 wickets in the five tests). He never lost a series as captain. The Nine Network will air a special on the life of cricketing great Richie Benaud on Saturday night at 7pm. Nine will screen Richie Benaud: A Marvellous Life 1930-2015 about the public, private and cricketing achievements of the former Australian cricket captain and legendary commentator.

Article: (CNN)Anyone who has given birth -- or been an observer of the event -- knows how arduous it can be. But to do it live on the Internet? With two hooves sticking out for several minutes in the midst of labor? Luckily, Katie -- a giraffe at the Dallas Zoo -- is a champ. In an hour-long labor captured by 10 cameras and streamed live by Animal Planet, Katie gave birth to a not-so-little baby (about 6 feet tall) early Friday evening. There was no immediate word on the newborn's gender or condition. But there were good signs, as seen on the live stream and Dallas Zoo's Twitter feed -- like its ears moving, its efforts to stand, and its nursing (or at least trying to nurse) from mom. "We're so proud," the zoo tweeted. The newcomer's debut was a long time coming, especially when you count for Katie's 15-month gestation period -- average for a giraffe, according to Animal Planet. The baby joins a sister, 4-year-old calf Jamie. It wasn't immediately known how many people online saw Katie go into labor and give birth. But the giraffe definitely did have watchers in the form of fellow giraffes who saw the scene unfold from an abutting barn, one of them being Katie's BFF Jade. The fact that the spunky Katie held up so well under the spotlight isn't a total shocker.  The zoo describes her as the "diva" among a herd of 12 giraffes at the zoo who loves to "toss her head around" when she doesn't like something. As Animal Planet noted, "She's one of the only giraffes at the Dallas Zoo who can stick her long tongue out on cue." CNN's Justin Lear contributed to this report.

Article: He was once the most fearsome competitor in all of sport, infamous for his prickly nature towards rivals and single-minded pursuit of victory. But the Tiger Woods who has turned up to Augusta National this year is different. Very different. Earlier this week we were treated to the sight of Woods embracing Darren Clarke on the practice ground. Europe's Ryder Cup captain is an old pal of Tiger's so that was unusual, but understandable. So too was the sight of him sharing a hearty laugh with his old mucker, Mark O'Meara. But dancing? Yes, Tiger Woods dancing. Forget unusual, that is almost alarming. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO OF TIGER WOODS DANCING WHILE PRACTISING. Tiger Woods was spotted dancing while he practised on Monday at Augusta National. The former world No 1 had headphones in both ears as he listened to music while honing his game. A video has emerged of the former world No 1, with headphones in each ear, bopping away while he honed his wedge game on the practice ground on Monday. No prizes for the first person to ask: 'was he listening to Tiger Feet?' Augusta's patrons were treated to another glimpse of the new, cuddly Tiger on Wednesday morning as he enjoyed another manly hug with veteran Spaniard Miguel Angel Jimenez. Woods shared a warm greeting with Miguel Angel Jimenez on Wednesday morning. The 14-time major champion embraced the veteran Spaniard on the practice ground at Augusta. Jimenez watches on as Woods hits a drive during the build-up to the Masters. Perhaps the 50-year-old was offering Woods some tips on how to play the course, having finished fourth last year. Woods may be a four-time Masters champion but he has not played competitively since the first week in February and has battled through a bout of the chipping yips. Maybe the tunes have helped to release some of the tension in his short game. Woods will also play in the traditional Masters warm-up, the Par-3 Contest, for the first time in 11 years on Wednesday. The 39-year-old will be joined by his daughter, Sam, 7, and his son, Charlie, 6, for the event, which is a light-hearted affair for the players and their families. Woods and former champion Ben Crenshaw compare putters on the 13th green during a practice round. Woods is watched by his coach, Chris Como, as he hits on the driving range on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Australia's Marc Leishman has withdrawn from the Masters due to personal reasons. Leishman's wife Audrey was taken ill with an apparent case of pneumonia last week and put into an induced coma in hospital. 'It is with both deep regret and incredible relief I am withdrawing from the Masters tournament this week,' Leishman said in a statement. 'My wife Audrey has survived a life threatening medical emergency and I have decided to remain by her side with our children. 'Thanks to an incredible team of doctors and nurses Audrey appears to be on the road to a full recovery. Our two young children remain blessed to have the world's best mum in their lives. I want to pass along our thanks to all who supported us through this difficult period. 'We ask that you keep Audrey in your thoughts and prayers and I wish my best to all of the competitors for a great 2015 Masters.' Leishman finished joint fourth at Augusta when fellow Australian Adam Scott won the Masters in 2013. He had been due to tee off at 4:03pm BST on Thursday alongside former champion Ian Woosnam and Erik Compton. His withdrawal brings the field down to 97 players.

Article: (CNN)Do you remember the talk about plans for Iraqi-led force to try to take back Mosul this spring? Well, you might want to forget it. Nearly three months after a U.S. official said up to 25,000 Iraqis troops were expected to return to the key northern Iraqi city in April or May, a senior official in President Barack Obama's administration said Thursday that Washington is "not putting a timeframe on" a possible invasion. It "might be some time from now. Might be soon," another senior administration official said. Mosul has long been the big prize in the Iraqi government's fight -- aided by a U.S.-led military coalition, which has carried out airstrikes for months -- to defeat ISIS. It has also long been a source of embarrassment, considering how it fell after Iraqi troops dropped their weapons, abandoned their posts and ran for their lives when militants arrived last June. The senior administration officials who talked to reporters Thursday stressed the Iraqis and their allies are making progress in their fight against the group that calls itself the Islamic State. In fact, officials insist that ISIS has been degraded substantially thanks to a combination of air power and ground combat. The biggest and most recent example of this came with the recapture a few weeks ago of Tikrit, the hometown of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein that is located some 100 miles (160 kilometers) north of Baghdad. Iraqi forces aided by Iranian-backed Shiite militiamen took that northern city, the same place where ISIS allegedly massacred Iraqi troops last year. Still, Mosul isn't Tikrit. For one thing, it has a lot more people -- about a million, one Obama administration official noted. And it's more important not only to Iraq, but ISIS, meaning the terrorist group has all the more reason to go all-out to defend it. In some ways, the campaign for Mosul has begun, according to officials. There are no plans for U.S. combat troops involvement in an eventual operation, they say, but airstrikes have already targeted ISIS positions in the area. Just because the area has been softened up some from the air, though, doesn't mean a full ground assault is imminent. Calling for "patience," an administration official said that winning Mosul is a complex endeavor. It will "take a lot of capacity," the official said, "and some time to build."

Article: Matej Vydra's superb volley helped keep Watford on the trail for automatic promotion as they recorded a 2-0 victory over a spirited Millwall side, who sank further into relegation trouble. Millwall were on top for much of the first half but a stunning hit from Vydra saw the Hornets take in a slender advantage at half-time. Aiden O'Brien was a constant menace for the hosts - who had an early penalty shout turned down - but Watford were far too clinical, as Adlene Guedioura slotted a vital second goal shortly after the break. Matej Vydra fires home his stunning volley from the edge of the box to put Watford into the lead. Vydra is congratulated by his Watford team-mates as his goal moved the club towards automatic promotion. Millwall keeper David Forde was called into action in the first minute, doing well to deny Troy Deeney after the striker had broken the offside trap. The Lions quickly gathered momentum and despite some promising approach play - with O'Brien at the heart of much of it - failed to create any meaningful opportunities. And the home side had a legitimate penalty shout after Ben Watson bundled over of Ed Upson, as the midfielder jinked in from the right, but that went unpunished. After Watford weathered the storm, Vydra produced his moment of inspiration by volleying in from just outside the box in the 26th minute. Forde was helpless as the Czech thumped the ball into the far corner from Ikechi Anya's cross. Millwall, playing with renewed hope of survival after a first win in 10 on Good Friday, then squandered a golden opportunity when Martyn Woolford failed to pick out O'Brien lurking unmarked two yards from goal. Adlene Guedioura celebrates in front of the travelling fans after making it 2-0 and sealing the three points. Troy Deeney, who went close early on, is tackled by Millwall's Shaun Williams during the Championship clash. The hosts also ended the half in the ascendency as Jimmy Abdou's scuffed shot was well saved by Heurelho Gomes. Millwall huffed and puffed as they had in the first-half, but created few chances of any note. They came closest to boosting their slim survival hopes when O'Brien robbed Matthew Connolly of possession, but Gomes saved well. In the 54th minute, Anya - as he did for Vydra's opener - created Watford's second. The Scottish winger combined with Troy Deeney to outfox Shaun Cummings and Sid Nelson before squaring for Guedioura, who tucked away a six-yard tap-in. Deeney dives in to stop Dan Harding getting past, as Millwall slipped closer to relegation. It was a goal that Watford's second-half performance deserved, as they overcame Millwall's superiority before the break to showcase the quality that puts them on the brink of the Premier League. They twice came close to adding to the lead, as first Vydra then Odion Ighalo ran free on goal. Forde managed to gather the ball at Vydra's feet and then saved agilely from substitute Ighalo. Avoiding defeat would have equalled their longest unbeaten run of the season at four games, but the Lions more than likely need to go without a loss in all five of their remaining fixtures to stand any chance of beating the drop.

Matej Vydra converts Ikechi Anya cross after 26 mintues. Adlene Guadeioura doubles Hornets advantage in second half. Millwall remain seven points from safety, and are second from bottom.

Article: (CNN)Where do you go from here? The fourth season of "Game of Thrones" saw massive battles, major deaths (Tywin!) and White Walkers, but what can fans expect Sunday as we head into a fifth season of one of the most popular shows in HBO history? It's the most high-profile premiere yet, airing simultaneously in 170 countries for the first time. (HBO is a Time Warner company, like CNN.) We sought out "Thrones" aficionado Doug Gross, a writer for Nerdwallet and a former CNN employee, who had a few thoughts on the matter (beware, TV fans, he has read the books). "We're going to start seeing some of the show's major story arcs coming together," Gross said (as confirmed by the executive producers). "Already, Stannis has shown up at the Wall to save Jon Snow and the rest of the Night's Watch from the wildlings," he said. "Now we'll see how his quest for the Iron Throne collides with the Watch's supposedly non-political role protecting the realm." Tyrion's path should cross with Daenerys' this season, according to the trailers. "Season five also will be unique in that some of the major story arcs will clearly be moving ahead of where George Martin is in the 'Song of Ice and Fire' books," Gross pointed out. Executive producer David Benioff told Rolling Stone, "We are starting to build to a crescendo, which means the battles have to get bigger and things have to get more dramatic." Indeed, this fifth season means we're past the halfway point, with the show currently set to end after seven years. The Stark daughters, Arya and Sansa, will be the characters to watch this season, as will Cersei. The world of Westeros is constantly plagued by war, but is there a time when people have just had enough? "Wars are waged by the nobles, but it's the common folk who suffer," Gross noted. "And, this season, we'll get a glimpse of what happens when those common people have had enough."

Article: Most parents have the souvenir of a scan of their child in the womb at 12 weeks. The must-have for IVF mums and dads these days, however, is a video and pictures right from the moment of conception. The images are thanks to revolutionary technology that allows medics to record the microscopic miracle of life – from fertilisation to the division of cells, right through to the growth of an embryo. Hundreds of parents are now the proud owners of these EmbryoScope images, which are also helping scientists learn more about the IVF process. Scroll down for video. Pictured is the very first cell division of Pixie Morley, now aged nine months, taken using the revolutionary EmbryoScope technology. Sally and Stephen Morley (pictured with their daughter Pixie) are one of some 1,500 couples in Britain who have had babies using EmbryoScope technology. Sally and Stephen Morley are among them. The grainy grey and white picture on this page shows the first cell division in the creation of their IVF baby, Pixie. A tiny camera, placed inside an incubator, films the reproduction process. As well as allowing parents to watch back the moment the embryos form, the technology – developed in the US – also allows experts to select the best possible embryos based on how they form during the conception process. This narrows a mother’s chance of miscarrying. The Morleys, from Walsall, had spent months trying to have children naturally before opting for IVF. Mrs Morley, 38, the head of a nursery, said: ‘I knew time was against me being 36 when we started trying so when I failed to get pregnant each month I knew we should have fertility tests as soon as possible.’ While the couple were undergoing IVF, the EmbryoScope technology was introduced at the Midland Fertility Clinic, allowing them to be the first in their area to capture their child’s conception on camera. The technology allows medics and parents to watch the cell dividing. Pictured is the cell division of now nine-month-old Pixie. In October 2013, the embryo was transferred into Mrs Morley’s womb and within two weeks she was told by doctors that the process had been successful. Now, nine months after Pixie’s birth, she is still able to re-watch the moment her daughter was conceived. Experts have hailed the technology as one of the most important developments in IVF. Professor Simon Fishel, who is boss of Care Fertility, the first clinic in Britain to use the EmbryoScope, said: ‘We now know that embryos that do make babies and embryos that don’t make babies do different things. 'And to be able to see this in a time-matched movie and to be able to analyse it scientifically is absolutely wonderful science for us.’ Professor Fishel, who was part of the team that produced first test-tube baby, Louise Brown, in 1978, said the EmbryoScope was revealing the secrets about what happens to embryos as they develop – and why it is that around 70 per cent of them do not actually make babies. The videos were also an emotional milestone in the process of becoming a parent, Professor Fishel said. ‘The couple can see the process of fertilisation, see the cells divide, see the number of cells grow and see them produce an embryo…it is nothing short of observing the wonderful miracle of life.’ The video given to parents is a sped-up version of the process which occurs before the embryo develops. Professor Fishel said his patients were ‘awestruck’ when given the footage but that the clinic only gave parents the video once a mother had fallen pregnant. He added that, at across the Care Fertility clinics, 1,000 couples, who had gone on to have a baby, had been given footage of their embryo’s development.

Article: (CNN)A popular Chinese television host known for impromptu satire is now the subject of controversy after being caught on camera cursing the late Chairman Mao Zedong. Bi Fujian, who works for state-run China Central Television, was filmed at a dinner party singing a revolutionary song that eulogizes the Communist Party's early years when he started going off script. "The Communist Party, Chairman Mao. Don't mention that old son of a b***h. He made us suffer so bad," went Bi's improvised lyrics. The other dinner guests burst into laughter. Bi later apologized. "My personal speech has led to grave social consequences, and I feel remorseful for that. I hereby sincerely apologize to the public. As a public figure, I shall learn the lesson from this incident, adhering to strict self-discipline," he posted on Weibo, China's Twitter-like social media platform. Making disrespectful references to China's leaders in public is considered a taboo in China, even today. And Bi's comment was directed at the man regarded by many as the country's founding father -- despite his controversial reputation. The 75-second video clip, seemingly filmed on the cellphone of another dinner guest, was uploaded on Monday. Since then, it has been removed from video-sharing sites inside China, although it was still accessible on Weibo. It's unclear when the incident occurred, or what the relationsip was between the camera person and Bi. CCTV said it would investigate. "As a CCTV presenter, Bi Fujian's speech in the online video has led to grave social consequences," the network said in a statement posted on its Weibo account. CCTV did not respond to a CNN request for comment. Fondly known as "Grandpa Bi," the 56-year-old TV personality was born and grew up in the Mao era. The song Bi riffed on was part of a "red" Peking opera that was first performed in the late 1950s. It was popularized during the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s -- which was launched by Mao -- when China was torn apart by violence and social unrest. The video quickly divided China's online community. Critics said Bi, as an influential public figure, deserved a harsh punishment. But others rushed to his defense, arguing that Bi was simply enjoying himself in a private setting and was set up by whoever uploaded the clip. The video also emerged just a day before the new head of CCTV started his job, leading some to wonder if it were a case of "a new broom sweeps clean." Mao still divides opinion in China. His giant portrait hangs on Beijing's Tiananmen Gate, and thousands flock to see his embalmed body at his mausoleum in Tiananmen Square in the heart of the Chinese capital. But despite this reverence, Mao's is a deeply flawed legacy. Many remember him as a brutal dictator who inspired fear, paranoia and famine, and whose actions resulted in tens of millions of deaths. CNN's Shen Lu contributed to this report.

McDowell carded a final round of 73 on Sunday to finish six over par and is now a combined 24 over for his eight appearances in the year's first major championship. 'I can't imagine not coming here,' the former US Open champion said. 'It would be sacrilege not to play here no matter how much it frustrates you as you have to enjoy it for what it is. Graeme McDowell tees off on the third hole during the third round at Augusta on Saturday. 'It is a celebration of golf on my favourite golf course in the world. It is. I love it. But it's unrequited. 'Once I feel like I have got one up on this course it takes two back. I walk away still disappointed a little that I can't score as well as I feel I should round this course. I threw away shots like confetti all week. 'I think it's a puzzle you can solve. I realised my style of putting is not suited to Augusta. I'm going to have to work on a type of speed putting that's going to be suitable. McDowell carded a final round of 73 on Sunday to finish six over par for the tournament. 'You have to be a 'front-edge' putter like Bubba (Watson), I've never seen anyone roll in putts from six feet slower than Bubba. You have to drop them in and I have to adapt to do that round here.' McDowell's score could have been even worse after he was initially given a one-shot penalty for moving his marker as he attempted to swat a bee away from his ball on the third green. However, European Tour chief referee John Paramor rescinded the penalty a few holes later and McDowell added: 'I said could he follow me the rest of the day because he was the first guy who has saved me a shot in a while.' It would be sacrilege not to play here no matter how much it frustrates you,' McDowell said on Sunday.

Article: (CNN)Rebekah Gregory blinked back tears as she thought about the verdict. It had been almost two years since Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his brother planted bombs at the Boston Marathon, setting off deadly explosions that wounded her and hundreds of others. In court last month, she testified that one of the blasts on that day in 2013 left her lying in the street, staring at her own bones. Now, jurors have found him guilty on all 30 counts he faced for the deadly bombings and their aftermath. But no verdict can ever totally make up for the pain, she said. "I don't believe that there will ever be justice brought to this, no mater if he does get the death penalty or he remains in prison for the rest of his life," she said, crying as she spoke to reporters outside her Texas home. "I do believe, however, that he should be held accountable for his actions. And I'm very thankful for each of the jury members that are making him do that." Gregory, who wrote a widely publicized letter to Tsarnaev after testifying, said the trial has left her and other victims reeling from a flood of emotions as they relive horrifying memories, but it's an important step. "Everything is being brought up again full force. Our lives will never ever be the same, but I hope with this we can move forward and remember that we are still here for a reason, that there's a bigger plan," she said. "I may be standing on one fake leg, but I'm standing here, stronger than ever, because someone tried to destroy me, and he failed." For Gregory and others who lived through the 2013 attack, Wednesday's verdict brought a mix of emotions, from triumphant vows to move forward, to expressions of gratitude, to debate over whether Tsarnaev should be sentenced to death. There were no outbursts inside the federal courthouse in Boston. In fact, there was barely any peripheral noise as people sat on the edges of their seats. As Tsarnaev fidgeted and scratched the back of his head, some survivors and victims' family members lowered their heads and dabbed tears. As CNN's Alexandra Field noted from inside the courtroom, "They've waited a long time for this." The family of Sean Collier, a 26-year-old police officer shot to death in his patrol car on the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan, were terrorists who "failed monumentally" in striking fear in people. "While today's verdict can never bring Sean back, we are thankful that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev will be held accountable for the evil that he brought to so many families," the Collier family said in a written statement. To Richard "Dic" Donohue, an MBTA police officer left in a pool of blood after being wounded in a shootout with the Tsarnaevs in Watertown, the verdicts show that "as a society,... terrorism will not prevail, and we will hold those accountable for their acts against our nation." "Justice has been served today," Donahue tweeted. Survivor Karen Brassard said she needed to attend the trial to help her heal. She doesn't believe Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's brother Tamerlan, now dead, persuaded him to take part in the plot, as the defense contended. Dzhokhar, in her view, was "all in." "Obviously we are grateful for the outcome today," Brassard tolder reporters. "It's not a happy occasion, but it's something that we can put one more step behind us." That sense of turning the page was echoed by Bruce Mendelsohn, who is among those who rushed to save lives at the marathon finish line. The verdicts mean that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is no longer a bombing suspect -- he is now officially a "convicted killer." You can't call it celebration. But there is a newfound peace of mind, at least, in and around Boston. This was a community that suffered greatly after the bombing and subsequent manhunt. And they got through it by rallying around each other, a deep bond reflected in the mantra "Boston Strong." That feeling was reaffirmed all around the city by Wednesday's verdict. And it's evident in people like Heather Abbott, who lost her left leg below the knee. Since then, she's become a living example of someone who wasn't stopped by the terror -- learning not only to walk again, but to run again. "Nothing can ever replace the lives that were lost or changed forever," Abbott said Wednesday on Facebook. "But at least there is some relief in knowing that justice is served and responsibility will be taken." That view was commonly shared. For those hurt -- physically, mentally, emotionally -- by the horrors of 2013, Wednesday was key to their progression. But it's not the end of the road. Just ask Jeff Bauman. The picture of him, bloodied, being rushed through the streets of Boston by good Samaritan Carlos Arredondo, became a symbol of the carnage and heroism from this attack. Even after losing both his legs, Bauman has become a symbol since of resilience -- moving on with his life, by marrying and fathering a child. On Wednesday, Bauman said the verdict "will never replace the lives that were lost and so dramatically changed." "But it is a relief," he added, "and one step closer to closure." CNN's Ann O'Neill and Steve Almasy contributed to this report.

Layton Ndukwu had given Leicester hope of clawing back the advantage with 20 minutes to go but substitute Buckley and Barker struck to kill that dream off and set up a final against Chelsea later this month. City will face Chelsea at a venue, likely to to be the City Football Academy Stadium, in the first leg on April 20 before travelling to Stamford Bridge a week later on April 27.

Leicester City: Smith-Varnham, Miles, Chilwell (c), Choudhury, Kipre, Johnson, Bailey (Barnes 62), Fox, King, Rowe (Muskwe 72), Ndukwu. Unused subs: Knight, Bramley, Dombrauskis,. Bookings: Choudhury. Manchester City: Haug, Maffeo, Humphreys, Oliver, Angelino, Bryan (c) (Bullock 92), Nemane, Wood (Buckley 46), Celina, Garcia, Barker. Unused subs: Albinson, Fernandes, Dilrosun. Bookings: Wood, Bryan, Angelino. With City holding a big advantage from the first leg last month, this clash always looked difficult for Leicester, and their inability to find an early goal made the task of overhauling the advantage even tougher. City were the better team for much of the first half but goalkeeper Kjetil Haug had to be aware to keep out Hamza Choudhury from close range at the other end. That was their best chance until Charlie Oliver handled inside his own penalty area with 20 minutes to go to gift Ndukwu the chance to give the home side the lead. That opportunity was one he gratefully accepted, confidently dispatching his spot-kick past Haug. Layton Ndukwu of Leicester City scores from a penalty to cut the deficit but it was not Leicester's night. Brandon Barker (right) scored City's second goal of the evening as they made it to a first final in seven years. Despite still holding a decent lead, City surged forward in response and Buckley equalised, thumping home Barker's cross. And Buckley effectively returned the favour when he was hauled down inside the area moments later to allow Barker to make it 5-1 on aggregate from the spot. City march on and face Chelsea in a rematch of their last final in this competition seven years ago. The Premier League champions' youth side won 4-2 on aggregate on that occasion and will be hoping for a repeat this year.

Article: (The Hollywood Reporter)Richard Dysart, the Emmy-winning actor who portrayed the cranky senior partner Leland McKenzie in the slick, long-running NBC drama "L.A. Law," has died. He was 86. Dysart, who also played Coach in the original 1972 Broadway production of Jason Miller's Pulitzer Prize-winning "That Championship Season," died Sunday at home in Santa Monica after a long illness, his wife, artist Kathryn Jacobi, told The Hollywood Reporter. The acclaimed "L.A. Law" — created by Steven Bochco (who eventually handed off the series to David E. Kelley) and Terry Louise Fisher — aired for eight seasons from 1986 to 1994. For playing the founder of the firm McKenzie, Brackman, Chaney and Kuzak, Dysart was nominated for the Emmy for outstanding supporting actor in a drama series for four straight years, finally winning the trophy in 1992. "I always had him in mind for that role," Bochco said in a 2002 interview with the Archive of American Television. "He's so avuncular. So I reached out to him. You know, Dick is sort of an old hippie. So he went into his closet and tried to find a lawyer outfit, and he came to meet us wearing a suit and tie. He was perfect." "We got together, mapped out the character's past to give us a basis from which to work, and it's all gone smoothly since then," Dysart said in a 1990 interview with The Seattle Times. "Sometimes I worry — it's all been going too well — a role I love to play in a series that's about as good as you can get. Something's wrong!" Perhaps Dysart's most memorable character arc on the show was when he was found in bed with power-hungry competitor Rosalind Shays (played by Diana Muldaur). He was one of the few actors to appear in every episode. Dysart's range of authority -figure parts ran right to the top. He limned Harry Truman in the CBS telefilm "Day One" and in the ABC miniseries "War and Remembrance," both of which aired in 1989, and he was Henry L. Stimson, the 33rd U.S. president's Secretary of War, in the 1995 HBO telefilm "Truman," starring Gary Sinise. Similarly, he played the Secretary of Defense in "Meteor" (1979). Hollywood Reporter: Most powerful people in N.Y. media. Dysart also performed extensively in the medical- (movie) field, performing enough doctor roles to, perhaps, qualify to practice. His two most memorable came in classic satires: in Paddy Chayevsky's scathing "The Hospital" (1971), starring George C. Scott (a good friend), and in "Being There" (1979), as Melvyn Douglas' doctor. He also was a doctor who died a gruesome death in John Carpenter's "The Thing" (1982) and a physician in such films as "The Terminal Man" (1974), "The Falcon and the Snowman" (1985) and "Warning Sign" (1985). Dysart portrayed J. Edgar Hoover in the 1993 USA telefilm "Marilyn & Bobby: Her Final Affair" and in Mario Van Peebles' "Panther" (1995). Dysart also excelled as cranky coots and shifty sorts. He portrayed a motel receptionist in Richard Lester's "Petulia" (1968); was the bad guy who battled Clint Eastwood in "Pale Rider" (1985); stood out as a power player in Oliver Stone's "Wall Street" (1987); and sold barbwire in "Back to the Future III" (1990). Dysart was born March 30, 1929, in Boston and raised in Maine. Following high school, he attended the Gould Academy in Bethel, Maine, for a year, served in the U.S. Air Force and attended Emerson College, where he graduated with a master's degree in speech communications. At the time, he was interested in a career in radio (he became fascinated with the medium in first grade, when he was bedridden for a year because of rheumatic fever) but was soon tempted by acting. He moved to New York on a whim and was able to land minor roles on TV and a part in an off-Broadway production of "The Iceman Cometh" opposite Jason Robards. In the mid-1960s, he joined the American Conservatory Theater and toured the country doing plays, then landed roles on Broadway in "All in Good Time," "The Little Foxes" and "A Place Without Doors." He received a Drama Desk Award for his performance in "That Championship Season." Hollywood Reporter: Q&A with Liz Smith. Dysart's credits include an eclectic array of movies, including "The Crazy World of Julius Vrooder" (1974), "The Day of the Locust" (1975), "The Hindenburg" (1975), "An Enemy of the People" (1978), "Prophecy" (1979), "Mask" (1985) and "Hard Rain" (1998). On television, he was top-notch in the telefilms "The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman" (1974), "The People vs. Jean Harris" (1981), as Dwight D. Eisenhower in "The Last Days of Patton" (1986) and as studio chief Louis B. Mayer in "Malice in Wonderland" (1985). Survivors also include his stepson Arie and daughter-in-law Jeannine Jacobi, mother-in-law Lenore, brother and sister-in-law Nadine and John Jacobi and grandchildren Abby and Levi. A private memorial is being planned. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be made to the Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum, an outdoor theater in Topanga Canyon in the Los Angeles area. Dysart and Jacobi had a second home in the forests of British Columbia. He was lured out of retirement for his last onscreen appearance, the "L.A. Law" reunion telefilm of 2002. "They remain timely, with cases about points of law that are still current," he said of watching "L.A. Law" reruns in a 2002 interview with The Bangor Daily News. "[The show] was also one of the fathers of yuppiedom. It was very much of the times, and very Los Angeles. It holds up as well as any series I know."

Article: Lewis Hamilton's love of the Shanghai International Circuit continues to show no bounds as the reigning Formula One champion again claimed pole position for the race. Hamilton now has a record five poles to his name at the track, and three in succession, to take his tally to 41 overall in his career. The 30-year-old Briton ultimately finished just 0.042secs ahead of his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg to give the team another front-row lock out. Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel, a surprise winner last time out in Malaysia, will start third, albeit down by nine tenths of a second on Hamilton. Now click here to read the full qualifying report. Host commentator. Thank you for joining us this morning and be sure to return tomorrow for our coverage of Sunday’s race. 1 Hamilton; 2 Rosberg; 3 Vettel; 4 Massa; 5 Bottas; 6 Raikkonen; 7 Ricciardo; 8 Grosjean; 9 Nasr; 10 Ericsson. ‘Oh come on, guys’, Rosberg exasperates after missing out on pole by 0.042secs. Hamilton fails to improve on his time, but it doesn’t matter as Rosberg can’t beat his lap. It is Hamilton’s pole. Back on track and all 10 drivers are out for their final runs and they’re all on fresh tyres. Here we go…. Meanwhile... Vettel crosses the line to go fourth fastest as he splits the Williams pair of Massa and Bottas. We’ve got four minutes to run. The Mercedes pair are so much quicker than the rest of the field here. Raikkonen is the first of the Ferrari drivers to post a time and he is the best part of two seconds slower than Hamilton on a used set of option tyres. And Hamilton crosses the line with a 1:35.782. Wow. What can Rosberg do? The Mercedes man is 0.280secs slower than his team-mate. Bottas is the first driver to post a competitive lap, and he crosses the start-finish line with a 1:37.903… but it is Hamilton up next. We’ll see two runs from each driver and Hamilton is the first of the Mercedes pair to take to the track. So, we’re already underway with the final session to determine the top 10… surely, Lewis Hamilton won’t be stopped in his quest for a third straight pole this year? So, surprisingly both Toro Rossos fail to make the top-10 shootout with Verstappen and Sainz to start 13th and 14th tomorrow. Hamilton remains the quickest man on the track. So, we’re in the last minute of Q2 and Massa, Ericsson, Nasr and Perez are facing the drop. Vettel crosses the line to go faster than Raikkonen,  but he is half-a-second off Hamilton’s mighty lap. Raikkonen goes third-fastest with a 1:37.1, but the Finn is seven tenths slower than Hamilton… what can Vettel do in the sister Ferrari? Neither Ferrari driver are yet to post a time, so the best of the rest behind the Mercedes pair is currently the Lotus of Romain Grosjean, 1.6 seconds slower than Hamilton. That really is a stunning time from the world champion. Rosberg follows Hamilton across the line, but he is three tenths slower than his Mercedes team-mate. The Briton really appears to be a class above his Mercedes team-mate this weekend. Valtteri Bottas leads the way until Hamilton posts a 1:36.423 with his first run of the afternoon on the soft-option tyre. He then reports that his seat was getting really warm on that lap; a problem he mentioned during practice this morning. The second session is underway in Shanghai to determine which drivers will make it through to the top-10 shootout. That’s quite a big shock to see McLaren on the penultimate row again. Button, Alonso and the team have been speaking with plenty of optimism this weekend, but they will start tomorrow’s race only 17th and 18th. So, the McLaren drivers do not make it out of Q1 and Button and Alonso will start on the penultimate row for tomorrow's Chinese Grand Prix. But as I write that, Vettel goes fastest with a 1:37.502. Carlos Sainz, Pastor Maldonado, Romain Grosjean, Will Stevens and Roberto Merhi occupy the drop zone with a minute to go…. Raikkonen is back on track, on the softs, and it is the Finn’s turn to top the timesheets as he goes some two tenths faster than Bottas. Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa are both on the option tyres for their first timed runs of the afternoon. Bottas goes fastest with a 1:38.014 as Massa slots into third. Button, also on the soft compound, is faster than Alonso by four tenths, and he slots his McLaren into P7. The Briton comes over the radio to complain that the ‘rears are overheating’. Alonso is already donning the soft compound tyre. He comes across plenty of traffic on his fast lap, but still manages to go eighth… for now. So, with 10 minutes to go, Hamilton leads the way from Rosberg, Hulkenberg, Felipe Nasr, Vettel, Raikkonen and the ever-impressive Max Verstappen. Rosberg is the next driver to cross the line and he posts a lap of 1:38.496 which is some two tenths off his team-mate. Nico Hulkenberg, on the much faster softer compound tyre, pops his Force India into third. Here comes Hamilton, who looks at ease in his Mercedes, and the British driver is 1.6 seconds faster than Vettel. Ouch. Raikkonen crosses the line to post a 1:40.917, but he appeared to be struggling with plenty of understeer on that lap and Vettel crosses the line to go one second quicker than his Ferrari team-mate. Plenty of smoke as Lewis Hamilton’s Mercedes is fired up, but there’s no problem with the world champion’s Silver Arrows as he takes to the circuit for Q1. Kimi Raikkonen meanwhile is the first big gun out on a hot lap…. Fernando Alonso failed to post a time in this morning's practice session, but the Spaniard is first out of the blocks as today's qualifying session gets underway. Security has been ramped up for this week’s race in China after a spectator managed to get on to the track during yesterday’s second practice session. The local man darted across the start-finish line before leaping over the pit wall and walking into the Ferrari garage. He is then alleged to have said: ‘I want a car. I’ve got a ticket.’ Rosberg has been challenged by Mercedes F1 chairman Niki Lauda to raise his game this weekend after being outclassed by Hamilton in both races so far this term. Here, the German is taking part in his traditional warm-up before hopping into his Mercedes for this afternoon’s qualifying session. That said, Mercedes, and Lewis Hamilton in particular, appear to be back to their ominous best in Shanghai. Hamilton has been fastest in all three practice sessions this weekend at a track where he has already won on three occasions and was the pole-sitter here in 2013 and again last year. The 30-year-old posted a time of one minute 37.615secs, finishing 0.226secs quicker than team-mate Rosberg. Fresh from his win in Sepang, Vettel was the best of the rest, albeit some seven tenths down on Hamilton’s best lap. Good morning and welcome to our coverage of today’s qualifying session for the Chinese Grand Prix. After Lewis Hamilton led Nico Rosberg home in a Mercedes one-two at the curtain raiser in Melbourne, we were told a year of domination from the Silver Arrows loomed. But how wrong they  were. Sebastian Vettel, in his Ferrari, upset the odds to roar to victory in Malaysia to blow the race for the championship back open and give Mercedes food-for-thought ahead of this week’s Chinese Grand Prix and for the remainder of the campaign.

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence.
Lewis Hamilton claimed his third straight pole position of the season. Nico Rosberg was just 0.042secs slower than his Mercedes team-mate. German says: 'Oh, come on, guys,' when told he is slower than Hamilton. Sebastian Vettel will start third for Ferrari with Felipe Massa fourth. McLaren endured another difficult day with Jenson Button and Fernando Alonso only 17th and 18th on the grid for Sunday's race.

Article: (CNN)The outlines of a nuclear deal with Iran are in place. Unfortunately, it seems like too many in President Barack Obama's administration have forgotten that the only reason this terrorist-supporting state came to the negotiating table in the first place was because of tough sanctions imposed by the U.S. Congress. Indeed, the reality is that President Obama is giving up enormous leverage in his nuclear deal with Iran -- and I worry we will lose it for good. Bleeding money, and faced with falling oil prices, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei gave his government rare permission to bargain with the "Great Satan" -- the United States. But just as U.S. and European sanctions were forcing Iran to the nuclear crossroads, President Obama has given Tehran an easy exit. For Khamenei, the "framework" announced last week looks like a win-win: He gets to keep his nuclear infrastructure, and in return gets billions of dollars in sanctions relief. Congress offered a better strategy when the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, Eliot Engel, and I introduced a bill to hit Tehran with its toughest sanctions yet. Unfortunately, this bill -- which passed the House in a 400-20 vote -- was blocked in the Senate last year, despite the fact that it would have sharpened the Ayatollah's choice: Dismantle your nuclear weapons program or see your economy collapse. President Obama once had a tougher line, when in 2012 he said: "The deal we'll accept is they end their nuclear program. It's very straightforward." But the framework announced last week does nothing of the sort. Negotiated between Iran and the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany, the framework concedes that Iran can maintain "a mutually defined enrichment program," operate thousands of centrifuges, and continue its research and development of nuclear technologies. The deal currently on the table would hand Tehran billions of previously sanctioned funds, filling the coffers of the world's biggest state sponsor of terrorism, with strongholds in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Lebanon. Meanwhile, the strictest restrictions on Iran's enrichment will expire in only 10 years, despite the President receiving a letter from 367 Members of Congress -- both Democrats and Republicans -- in which we insisted that "verifiable constraints on Iran's nuclear program must last for decades." The President admitted as much when he conceded that "in year 13, 14, 15, they have advanced centrifuges that enrich uranium fairly rapidly, and at that point the breakout times would have shrunk almost down to zero." But as bad as these concessions are, the most concerning aspect of the April 2 deal is that it lacks tough safeguards to stop Iran from cheating. The key question is this: Will the inspectors at the International Atomic Energy Agency be allowed to inspect these military sites without warning? Because if the IAEA cannot conduct "anytime, anywhere" inspections, Iran will be able to "sneak out" to a bomb. It has been done before. Remember, in 1994, when President Bill Clinton told us he had struck a deal with North Korea that would "make the United States, the Korean Peninsula, and the world safer"? President Clinton sounded a little too much like the current Secretary of State John Kerry, when he promised that the North Korea agreement "does not rely on trust" and that "compliance will be certified by the International Atomic Energy Agency." Twelve years after these assurances, North Korea detonated its first nuclear bomb. Iran could easily do the same. The best predictor of its future behavior is its past behavior -- between 2004 and 2009, the Iranian government built a huge centrifuge facility named Fordo under a mountain deep in the Iranian desert. Luckily for the world, Western intelligence agencies discovered Tehran's deception. But we cannot rely on such luck in the future, particularly when Iran still hasn't come clean about its history of secret weapons development and is still dodging basic questions from the IAEA. Let's not forget the other things Iran has been doing while its diplomats have been bargaining with the U.S. and its partners. While Iran was showing its friendly new face to the world, it has simultaneously been helping Syrian dictator Bashar al Assad kill his own people, training and funding the terrorist group Hezbollah, which aims to annihilate Israel, and supporting the Houthis, who started a civil war and overthrew the government in Yemen -- one of America's more reliable counterterrorism partners in the region. If President Obama is going to hand over billions of dollars to a regime that behaves like this, run by a man who publicly declares: "Death to America," it has to be a better deal. The framework we have before us keeps Iran's nuclear door well and truly open.

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence. The author argues that the nuclear deal with Iran is a bad one because it allows Iran to keep its nuclear infrastructure and gives it billions of dollars in sanctions relief without sufficient safeguards to prevent cheating, and that the

Article: Robert Lewandowski returned to haunt his former club as Bayern Munich earned a narrow victory against Borussia Dortmund at the Signal Iduna Park on Saturday. Poland international Lewandowski scored the winner on his first visit back to the club he left on a free transfer last summer as Pep Guardiola's side restored their 10-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga. Lewandowski spent four years at Dortmund, leading them to back-to-back league titles during that period, and offered only a muted celebration when he pounced to give the visitors the lead 10 minutes before half time. Robert Lewandowski beats Marcel Schmelzer to the ball to head Bayern Munich in front against Dortmund. The Bayern players celebrate in front of the travelling supporters after claiming a narrow victory. Roman Weidenfeller saved Thomas Muller's original effort bu the ball fell kindly to the Poland striker. Weidenfeller complains to his defence as Lewandowski makes his way to his feet after scoring. Dortmund (4-2-3-1): Weidenfeller; Sokratis, Subotic, Hummels, Schmelzer; Bender, Gundogan (Mkhitaryan 79); Blaszczykowski (Kagawa 67), Reus, Kampl (Ramos 67); Aubameyang. Subs not used: Kehl, Langerak, Ginter, Dudziak. Booked: Aubameyang, Schmelzer. Bayern Munich: Neuer; Benatia, Boateng, Dante; Rafinha, Lahm (Thiago 69), Alonso, Schweinsteiger (Rode 58), Bernat; Muller (Gotze 79), Lewandowski. Subs not used: Pizarro, Gaudino, Reina, Weiser. Booked: Schweinsteiger, Alonso, Rode. Scorer(s): Lewandowski 36. Bayern suffered a shock 2-0 home defeat by Borussia Monchengladbach before the international break but responded to get their title charge back on track against their former championship rivals. Dortmund were unbeaten in their last eight domestic matches, sitting comfortably in mid-table after rescuing a desperate-looking situation earlier this year that saw Jurgen Klopp's side bottom of the table. But they were behind after 36 minutes against Bayern. Thomas Muller was released down the left channel but his low drive, after bursting towards the box, was parried by Roman Weidenfeller. Unfortunately for the Dortmund goalkeeper the ball rebounded invitingly for Lewandowski to beat Marcel Schmelzer to the ball and head home from 12 yards. Dortmund offered a spirited fightback  as the hosts applied much of the second-half pressure, but the Bayern defence held firm although they had Manuel Neuer to thank after saving brilliantly from a Marco Reus free kick in the closing stages. As his team-mates roared wildly around him Lewandowski did not celebrate against his former club. The goal did, however, send the Bayern bench into raptures although Pep Guardiola remained calm. Goalscorer Lewandowski holds off the challenge of Dortmund's Kevin Kampl. The teams line up to observe a minute silence for the passengers of the Germanwings flight that crashed.

Bayern Munich beat Borussia Dortmund 1-0 in the Bundesliga on Saturday. Robert Lewandowski opened the scoring vs his former club on 36 minutes. Dortmund applied much of the second-half pressure but were kept at bay. Bayern restored their 10-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga.

Article: (CNN)The VII Summit of the Americas was supposed to be all about the symbolic handshake between the United States and Cuba.  But insert Venezuela into the mix and Panama City, Panama, quickly turns into a "triangle of tension." Heads of state from 35 countries in the Western Hemisphere have met every three years to discuss economic, social or political issues since the creation of the summit in 1994.  Cuba has historically been the wrench in the diplomatic machinery, with some Latin American leaders threatening not to attend the Summit of the Americas if the United States and Canada didn't agree to invite President Raul Castro. The tide changed December 17, 2014, when President Barack Obama and Castro announced that more than five decades of Cold War rivalry was ending. Diplomats from both countries immediately began negotiations to establish embassies in Havana and Washington, and the attention immediately focused on the Summit of the Americas, where for the first time since the about-face, Obama and Castro would come face-to-face. The much anticipated handshake between Obama and Castro would steal all the headlines if it wasn't for Cuba's strongest ally, Venezuela. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro recently accused the United States of trying to topple his government and banned former President George Bush, former Vice President Dick Cheney, and Senators Bob Menendez and Marco Rubio from entering Venezuela. "They can't enter Venezuela because they're terrorists,"  Maduro said, blaming the American politicians for what he called terrorist actions in Iraq, Syria and Vietnam. The U.S. State Department said the allegations of U.S. involvement in a coup plot against Maduro were "baseless and false." Later,  Obama issued an executive order sanctioning seven Venezuelan officials for human rights violations and saying the country was a "threat to national security." White House officials said every executive order includes that language, but it has sparked a fiery response from Maduro, who has been collecting millions of signatures demanding the repeal of the order.  He also asked for repeal in full-page ads in The New York Times and in a Panama City newspaper. Maduro didn't stop there; he has been rallying other Latin American leaders, including Bolivian President Evo Morales, Ecuador's Rafael Correa and Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega. But perhaps most damning for the United States -- and creating the "triangle of tension" at the summit --  Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez has sided publicly with Maduro. "We reiterate our strong condemnation of the unacceptable and unjustifiable unilateral sanctions imposed against the sister nation of Venezuela and the continued foreign interference with the purpose of creating a climate of instability in that sister nation.  We ratify our firmest support to the Bolivarian Revolution and the legitimate government headed by President Nicolás Maduro," Rodriguez said. While the world watches for the photo-op of Obama and Castro, it's unclear if more Latin American diplomats will side with Maduro, and for America, the VII Summit of the Americas could go from "mi casa es su casa" to a walk into the lion's den.

Article: England must have played against worse teams than this St Kitts Invitational XI but, after a day that descended into near farce, it is difficult to think of any. Warm-up games can be low-key affairs but there cannot have been many times when an international side have been pitched against a team as bad as this. St Kitts were simply shambolic, so bad that Chigwell Cricket Club could give them a decent game, and an almost tragic example of the steep decline of Caribbean cricket. They were simply not fit for purpose. Jos Buttler appeals for a stumping as England dominated the second day of a farcical match in St Kitts. Mark Wood looked lively in his early spell after he was brought in for his first bowl for England. The statistics will say that England, having bowled St Kitts out for 59 on the first day of their opening two-day tour match, rattled up 379 for six declared with both Alastair Cook and Ian Bell retiring out. Then St Kitts, given just one session to hang on, capitulated again and finished on 76 for seven, narrowly avoiding handing England a hollow victory. The match was drawn, just about, and it should also have been hung and quartered. The modern fixture madness that will see England play 17 Tests in the next 10 months makes proper warm-ups almost impossible and is one of the main reasons why home teams nearly always win Test series these days. But when they are as meaningless as this it is questionable why it is even worth bothering. England may have spent time in the middle but they may as well have just turned up in Antigua next week to play the first of three Tests. Wood celebrates his first England wicket, but he is probably still a way off getting a first Test cap. Alastair Cook acknowledges the crowd after making a century, shortly before being retired out. Jos Battler had a short go at attacking the home bowlers before England declared with a mammoth 320 lead. For what it is worth, Bell and Joe Root made untroubled half-centuries yesterday after Cook had moved to his first century for England since the Ashes warm-up in Hobart 18 months ago and promptly retired. Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler then had a bit of a bash before England declared at the fall of Stokes just before tea, the small matter of 320 ahead. Then, in a move which further devalued the authenticity of the ‘contest,’ England brought Liam Plunkett and Mark Wood into the match for a work out. Wood, the Durham fast bowler, looked lively in his first bowl for England off his minimalist run-up and earned his first wicket when he bowled Shane Jeffers but it is unlikely to be enough to earn him a first Test cap just yet. Gary Ballance looked out of touch, the only real problem for England in a very comfortable match. Liam Plunkett charges in as England reduced their hosts to 24 for six in farcical circumstances. When St Kitts plummeted to 24 for six and almost had a batsman timed out before he emerged just in time with the Velcro on his pads barely fastened, the home side’s embarrassment was almost complete. Yet at least they regained a semblance of pride by holding on as England gave their two spinners a decent bowl, Akeem Saunders and Leon Clarke doing most to keep England at bay. The only place in England’s first Test team yet to be decided, it seems, is between Adil Rashid and James Tredwell for the sole spinner’s slot and Tredwell was the clear winner here, taking three wickets to Rashid’s one. The Yorkshireman will need to have a very good second match to edge out Tredwell. James Tredwell (left) outperformed Adil Rashid in the contest to be England's Test spinner next week. Buttler makes an unconventional stop as England came close to winning the game in just two days. The only concern for England will be the form of Gary Ballance who looked out of touch before falling for 16, the legacy perhaps of a World Cup where he somehow became a symbol of England’s unimaginative one-day thinking. England’s desperate attempt to get as much as they can from the second of these two warm-ups will tomorrow see them bowl 90 overs at St Kitts whatever happens and then bat for 90 overs on Thursday. The first cricket score of 225 for 25 could be recorded at Warner Park tomorrow and the once proud reputation of Caribbean cricket will most likely take another hit. Truly, it is a sad state of affairs.

England reduce Invitational XI to 24 for six after amassing lead of 320. Hosts hold out for a draw, but the game had descended into a farce. England will learn little from glorified net against woeful opposition. James Tredwell out-bowls Adil Rashid in contest to be Test spinner.

Article: Waterloo, Iowa (CNN)Martin O'Malley and Jim Webb share little in common. Both Democrats are toying with a presidential run, both are facing long odds in that endeavor, and both shared a stage at the Polk County Democrats Awards Dinner in Des Moines, Iowa, on Friday night. But, as was evident at the dinner, that is where the similarities end. O'Malley is a former mayor and Maryland governor who seems most at home when he is pressing the flesh at events and introducing himself to anyone who would extend their hand. Webb, on the contrary, is a decorated Vietnam War veteran and former senator from Virginia who comes across as more stoic and, at times, uncomfortable with retail politics. Before the event, O'Malley confidently cruised the union hall. He took selfies with young environmental activists and chatted with sometimes tepid supporters who admitted their other political allegiances. "It is a marathon, not a sprint," one man told O'Malley, a nod to his long odds in the 2016 Democratic nomination process. "Yes, it is; it's a marathon," O'Malley responded. "Welcome to Iowa," said another man. "We hope to see you here more." O'Malley smiled, "Thanks a lot. I hope you do, too." Webb wasn't nearly as active, opting instead to stay close to his seat near the front of the venue and chat with a small group of people around him. As Webb cut into his sizable helping of pork, O'Malley was standing directly behind him, shaking hands. The former Virginia senator, after possibly seeing O'Malley making the rounds, did stand up and shake hands with a few of the diehard Democratic activists in the room. "Seven months old," Zach Smith, a new father, said of his baby boy, Noah. "I have a bunch of kids. The youngest one is 8 years old," Webb said. The baby looked up at the senator. "He is pretty calm," Webb remarked, himself calm. Despite coming from bordering states, Webb and O'Malley don't know each other. When they passed each other in a Des Moines hotel lobby on Friday morning, it was the first time the two had met. That said, the two Democrats find themselves in the same position. Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state who is set to announce her presidential bid Sunday, leads every national and state poll of the Democratic field. She has begun to build a sizable staff and is expected to have massive amounts of money to win the nomination. O'Malley and Webb are both looking up at her. In a March CNN/ORC poll (PDF) of national Democrats, only 1% said O'Malley and Webb were their top choice. In a January poll from Bloomberg Politics and the Des Moines Register (PDF), O'Malley was at 1% among Iowa Democrats, while Webb found himself at 3%. The speaking portion of the night further showed Webb and O'Malley's differences. Webb, who spoke before the governor, gave a more subdued, biographical speech that mentioned three areas he would focus on if he ran for president: Basic governance, economic justice and criminal justice reform. To the approval of the audience, Webb promised to come back to Iowa regularly. "I am committing to you right now," he said, "we are going to go over the whole state." And the biggest applause came near the end of his speech, when he urged his party to get back to talking about issues. "Money is ruining our political process," Webb said to a chorus of applause and "hear hear." O'Malley, on the other hand, gave a speech littered with intentional applause lines. At points, the governor would deliberately stop to allow for the silence to be filled with clapping hands. "When the American Dream is denied, our lives shrink, our hopes fade, and our days unfold not in the light of possibility but in the darkness of fear," O'Malley said, delivering the same stump speech he usually gives. "To make the dream true again, we must fight for better wages for all workers, so that Americans can support their families on what they earn." As the event wound down, Webb and O'Malley stuck around to shake more hands and meet people. O'Malley, who spent the previous day in Iowa, left Friday night for New York. Webb, who is in the midst of a four-day trip to Iowa, stayed in Des Moines and headlined a veterans event on Saturday morning in Waterloo. Webb regularly speaks about his service and appeared more at home at the event. He told war stories with young and old veterans and spoke at length about how the government could be doing more for veterans. He also touted his work on passing the 21st Century G.I. Bill of Rights, a 2008 act that expanded education benefits for veterans, and stressed that more needed to be done. "You want the next greatest generation, give them the same opportunity the the greatest generation had," Webb said to applause. "If you really want to thank them, hire a vet." After the event, Webb shook hands with people veterans who told stories about dropped benefits and problems with the Department of Veterans Affairs. He occasionally smiled and thanked people for coming on a sunny Saturday morning. Asked whether he enjoys the retail politics that is crucial in early voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire, Webb smiled. Skepticism of retail politics is not new for Webb. As a one-term Democratic senator, Webb was rumored to loathe the burdens that came with campaigning, namely fundraising and retail politics. This time, he put on a rosy view. "This is the good part of it, "Webb said, with a laugh. "Talking to the media, that is not always the good part."

Article: Conor O’Shea has revealed his concern at the increasing force of rugby’s collisions after Harlequins and England full back Mike Brown was consigned to even more time on the sidelines to recover from the latest high-profile head injury. Brown has not played since the final round of the RBS 6 Nations on March 21, is still suffering headaches after a week-long holiday in Dubai and no closer to being declared symptom-free. The episode raises questions about whether the 29-year-old was brought back too early for England’s title-decider against France, having been knocked out in the Test against Italy five weeks earlier following a crunching collision with Andrea Masi. Mike Brown is knocked out in a collision with Italy’s Andrea Masi in the Six Nations last month. Brown was out cold for approximately eight minutes and hasn't played since the Italy game on March 21st. ‘It’s a concern because I don’t like someone coming in with something you can’t diagnose,’ said O’Shea, Quins’ director of rugby. ‘Sometimes a physio will sit you down and say, “It’s six to 12 weeks out”. Here it could be tomorrow or it could be whenever — we don’t have a timescale. There’s no doubt that a decade or even a year ago Browny would be back out on the pitch. ‘You want to see the gladiatorial side of things — the big hits that we’ve all grown up with. It was once a badge of honour that you got up and got on with it. But at least we’re now aware. Is it a concern for the game that we’re seeing collisions of the nature that we are? Yes, it has to be.’ Brown will have played just six of his club’s last 19 games after sitting out of the coming weekend, and his England team-mates Joe Marler and Chris Robshaw have featured in only eight of the last 18. Northampton have ruled out George North, who is suffering from his own concussion problems after being knocked out in three different collisions, until the end of the month and O’Shea must also deal with the absence of one of his marquee players. George North suffered his third concussion in four months during Northampton's defeat to Wasps. ‘You can look at a succession of events for George North, whereas this is a follow-on of symptoms from one event,’ said O’Shea. ‘Against Italy it was as big a hit as I’ve seen someone take. It was quite frankly a monstrous hit. I was pretty worried when I saw it live. ‘Is it tough on us having the England full back for six out of 19 games and still indeterminate? Yes, but there are more important things than rugby.’

Article: (CNN)Mullah Mohammed Omar is "still the leader" of the Taliban's self-declared Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. That appears to be the primary message of a biography, just published by the Taliban, of the reclusive militant who is credited with founding the group in the early 1990s. The Taliban's "Cultural Commission" released the 11-page document in several different translations on the movement's website, ostensibly to commemorate the 19th anniversary of an April 4, 1996, meeting in Afghanistan's Kandahar province when an assembly of Afghans swore allegiance to Omar. Several Afghan observers say the biography is aimed at dispelling rumors of Omar's demise. "There have been a lot of rumors lately about him. Some people are saying that he is not alive," said Sayyed Muhammad Akbar Agha, a former Taliban insider who has written an autobiography about his days with the movement. "I think the Taliban thought it was an important time to release his biography to give assurances that he is alive and present," Agha told CNN in a telephone interview. Bergen: Why U.S. must stay in Afghanistan past 2016. The biography also appears to be an attempt to remind the world of the Afghan's jihadi leadership credentials, at a time when ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has declared himself "caliph" of the world's Muslims. "The Taliban has a huge leadership problem at a critical political moment," said Graeme Smith, a Kabul-based analyst for the International Crisis Group. "Another caliph has announced himself to the world, and the Taliban has been silent. And that is getting noticed by militants across South Asia." Omar was famously camera-shy during the Taliban's six-year rule over most of Afghanistan. To this day, there are only a handful of photographs of the one-eyed leader. "He never was actively involved in any of these propaganda campaigns. No publicity. No interviews. He never used the Internet," said Rahimullah Yusufzai, a Pakistani journalist and expert on Afghanistan who once interviewed Osama bin Laden. Omar then all but disappeared after a U.S.-led bombing campaign routed the Taliban from Kabul in 2001. Washington has offered a $10 million reward for his capture. The Taliban have released written statements purportedly made by the leader-in-hiding. But years without any video or audio recordings of the fugitive have led to growing speculation that Omar may have died. The biography challenges rumors of Omar's death by offering a description of his daily work schedule, which begins with prayers, study of the Quran, and then delivering "orders in a specific way to his Jihadi commanders." The publication also seeks to fill in some of the gaps about the militant's early years, including the detail that his "preferred weapon of choice" was the RPG-7, a rocket-propelled grenade. According to the biography, Omar was born in 1960 in a village called Chah-i-Himmat in Afghanistan's Kandahar province. His father, a "well-known and respected erudite and social figure," died only five years later, apparently of natural causes. Omar studied at a religious school, or madrassa, run by his uncle. The rise of the Communist Party in Afghanistan, and the subsequent 1979 Soviet invasion, interrupted the young man's studies and propelled him into the arms of the armed Afghan opposition known as the mujahedeen. For the next decade, Omar commanded rebel groups "against the invading Russians and their internal communist puppets," according to the biography. Along the way, he was wounded a number of times and was blinded in his right eye. In one battle, the biography claims, Omar and a fighter named Mullah Biradar Akhund destroyed four Soviet tanks, even though they were armed with only four RPG rounds. The Taliban biography makes no mention of the fact that the U.S., allied with Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, helped arm and bankroll the mujahedeen until the Soviet army withdrew in defeat in 1989. Afghan historians have documented the rapid rise of the Taliban in the chaotic years after the communist government in Kabul collapsed in 1992. The movement of warriors who identified themselves as religious scholars emerged to bring order to a country being ripped apart by rival mujahedeen warlords who battled one another for power. The Taliban biography says that Omar and his compatriots "launched their struggle and fight against corruption and anarchy" after an initial meeting in Kandahar in June 1994. Two years later, the Taliban captured Kabul and began imposing its austere interpretation of Islamic law on the rest of the country. While the document denounces the Taliban's post-9/11 overthrow at the hands of a U.S.-backed coalition of rival Afghan fighters, it makes no mention of the Taliban's alliance with bin Laden and al Qaeda. During a decade in exile, the Saudi-born bin Laden continued to release periodic video and audio statements until he was killed by U.S. raid on his hideout in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad in 2011. Though Taliban militants have continued to battle the U.S.-backed government across Afghanistan, Omar has not been seen or heard from in years. The movement claims he continues to oversee a Taliban leadership council, judiciary and nine executive commissions, as well as military commanders who operate in all 34 provinces of Afghanistan.

Article: English cricket’s new bosses flexed their muscles when Paul Downton paid the price for a humiliating World Cup by being sacked as managing director. Downton was fired by new ECB chief executive Tom Harrison, in conjunction with chairman-elect Colin Graves, after a ring-round to each of the 14 members of the governing body’s management board ahead of their spring meeting today. The decision to sack a man who has endured a traumatic 14 months since succeeding Hugh Morris after England’s Ashes whitewash was unanimous, with one board member saying Downton was just ‘too accident prone’. Paul Downton has left his role as managing director of England and Wales Cricket Board. Downton leaves his role as ECB managing director following England's shameful performance at World Cup. It was Downton who took the huge call to sack Kevin Pietersen and then re-appointed Peter Moores, calling him ‘the outstanding coach of his generation’. He also oversaw the sacking of Alastair Cook as one-day captain. Former England captain Michael Vaughan immediately said he would like to speak to the ECB about the newly created job of director of England cricket and Andrew Strauss is another possible candidate. Ultimately it was England’s failure to negotiate the first round of the World Cup after an embarrassing defeat by Bangladesh and crushing reverses against Australia and New Zealand, coupled with disenchantment at their management style from many supporters, that did for former England and Middlesex wicketkeeper-batsman Downton. ‘The England Cricket Department needs to deliver performance at the highest level and our structure needs to be accountable for reaching the standards we aspire to,’ said Harrison in an ECB statement. ‘The new role we are putting in place will deliver an environment where world-class performance is at the heart of everything we do.’ Michael Vaughan (left) immediately threw his hat in the ring to replace the departed Downton. Vaughan's successor as England captain, Andrew Strauss (centre), is also thought to be a contender. That new role will be director of England cricket, a subtle but crucial change of title which will take the business aspect of the role away from the new man and effectively make him a supremo and, possibly, head selector. That makes James Whitaker, now the national selector, extremely vulnerable even though England won the last three Tests they played last summer and he could leave as soon as today’s board meeting at Lord’s. Yet Harrison played down any suggestion that this makes Moores, still with much to prove in his second coming as England coach, more vulnerable and that the door could now be nudged further ajar for the return of Pietersen, who has rejoined Surrey after being apparently encouraged by Graves. ‘This doesn’t impact on Peter Moores’ position at all,’ Harrison said later on Sky. ‘This is with respect to delivering an environment for the future.’ Downton's job description has been abolished as a result following England's dismal World Cup showing. England selector James Whitaker (left) and former managing director Downton during a nets session. Moores (from left to right), Downton and England captain Alastair Cook during the press conference. OCTOBER 2013. Downton, a former England wicketkeeper, is appointed managing sirector of England and Wales Cricket Board, with his position taking effect from February 1, 2014. FEBRUARY 2014. After the Ashes whitewash, Kevin Pietersen and head coach Andy Flower are sacked. After days of silence, the official line on Pietersen’s dismissal is that the ECB wanted to ‘create a culture’ in which captain Alastair Cook had ‘the full support of all players’. MARCH 2014. England suffer a humiliating 45-run defeat to Holland in the World T20. Ravi Bopara top-scored for England with just 18. APRIL 2014. Downton appoints Peter Moores, who had spent the previous four seasons as head coach at Lancashire, for a second spell as England head coach. MAY 2014. Downton and the ECB issue an apology to Pietersen for claiming he appeared ‘disinterested’ and ‘distracted’ during the fifth Ashes Test in Sydney. JUNE 2014. England lose a Test series at home to Sri Lanka. The south Asian side had previously won on English soil in 1998 — in a one-off Test match. JULY-AUG 2014. England lose the second Test against India, but come back to win the home series 3-1. In the fifth Test, England inflict upon India their third heaviest defeat in history. DECEMBER 2014. Cook is sacked as one-day captain and replaced by Eoin Morgan, marking the end of a sorry year for England in which they won just 18 of their 48 matches across all formats. FEBRUARY-MARCH 2015. England endure a dreadful World Cup campaign, failing to advance from the group stage and finishing behind Bangladesh, who sealed their exit with a 15-run victory. APRIL 2015. Downton departs as ECB managing director. The ECB are to create a new role of ‘director of England Cricket’ ahead of the Ashes series.

Paul Downton loses job as England and Wales Cricket Board's managing director of cricket after a little more than a year in the job. Chief executive of ECB, Tom Harrison, announced changes to the structure. Downton's job description has been abolished as a result.

Article: (CNN)#UporDown? That's the trending question on social media, thanks to a photo of a cat coming down some stairs. Or is it going up some stairs? (And you thought you were done with this kind of optical illusion free-for-all after #TheDress.) The picture was apparently uploaded on Imgur a few days ago and has caught fire thanks to a post on the website 9gag.com. Some people are noting the apparent motion of the cat. Others are commenting about the construction of the stairs. (Nobody has mentioned that some cats we could name would be more likely to stop in the middle of the steps and play with a mousie.) Of course, where there's public debate, there are advertisers waiting to take advantage of the situation. Taxes? Now, those are REALLY confusing.

Raheem Sterling pulled off some fine skill to open the scoring in the ninth minute at Anfield on Monday night. Joe Allen capitalised on a defensive mistake to score his first Anfield goal to make it 2-0 with 20 minutes to go. 'It was great to get that goal to give us that two-goal cushion,' Allen said. 'It wasn't my best game but I got the goal and helped the team. It was important after the defeats.' Newcastle had what looked a strong shout for a penalty when Dejan Lovren appeared to foul Ayoze Perez in the area, and Allen admitted he thought it was a spot-kick. 'I did get a good view of it as I'd missed the ball in the build-up,' he said. 'It look a good shout for a penalty, but I didn't get one the other night. These things happen.' Liverpool's players congratulate Allen on his goal that secured another vital win in the Premier League battle.

Article: (CNN)Tornado sirens blared Wednesday night in Kansas as several storms brought reports of twisters. Spotters reported a tornado about 6 miles northwest of Goddard, which is less than 15 miles west of Wichita.  That storm moved to the northeast, missing the city, but posing potential risks to other communities. "There will be storms... that pop up all night long," said CNN severe weather expert Chad Myers. "Nighttime tornadoes are the most deadly, are the most dangerous." Other reports of tornadoes came in from southwestern Kansas, according to the Storm Prediction Center. Three of the sightings were near Aetna, 125 miles southwest of Wichita. Kansas wasn't the only state affected by the storms. The National Weather Service indicated a tornado may have touched down in the small town of Potosi, Missouri, about 70 miles from St. Louis. CNN affiliate KMOV reported that it had received reports of wind damage and flooding in the town. One Instagram user there posted a photo of a fallen tree. Aerial footage also showed damage to roofs and one street overtaken by water. Not far away from Potosi, Shyler and Christin Strube in Leadington posted an Instagram picture of some unusual dark clouds. And a Twitter user in Farmington got bad news when he went out to his car. "They weren't kidding when they said baseball size (hail)," Kevin Knox wrote. On Thursday, more storms are expected in the Midwest, Mississippi River Valley, Tennessee River Valley and near the southern Great Lakes, the weather service said.

Article: (CNN)I remember the day I stopped praying. It was the day after my little brother, Jimmy, died of cancer. He was 25. I was so angry at God. I was 27 at the time, and, like most young people I had stopped going to church. But, on that day -- that terrible day -- I desperately needed to understand why God took my brother. I called the nearest Catholic church, looking for a priest. A lady picked up the phone. "Can I talk with Father?" I asked. I wish I could say her answer was "yes." Instead, she asked me if I was a member of that particular parish. "Does it matter?" I asked. (At the time I lived far from my home parish.) I don't remember how she responded, but the answer about my being able to see Father was clearly no. I don't know if all Catholic churches would have shut me out, but I figured, at the time, it was part of the long list of rules the Vatican required Catholic leaders to follow. I cried for a bit, then decided I would never ask God for anything. Clearly, his conduits on Earth did not have time for me -- a lifelong Catholic -- and sinner -- so why would he? Ever since, I've considered myself a lapsed Catholic. Until Pope Francis. There is something about Francis that's reawakened my faith. And it's not because he opened the floodgates to allow sin in the eyes of the church. He still argues against things I passionately support, but I find myself -- like many other lapsed Catholics -- enthralled. Recently I had the pleasure of meeting one of the Pope's newly appointed cardinals. His name is Cardinal Gerald Lacroix. The 57-year-old presides at the Basilica Cathedral of Notre Dame in Quebec City. One of my first questions: What is it about Pope Francis? "Every person is a mystery you know.... But what's evident is this man is living with such freedom, such inner freedom. He's himself. He's in tune with the Lord," Lacroix  told me. "Those close to him say he's up close to 4 in the morning to prepare his daily Mass, which is at 7 in the morning on the weekdays. So that's almost three hours of prayer, preparation and silence before the Lord and the word of God. Wow, that really fine-tunes you to start off a day." Perhaps that's how the Pope stays humble. Why he defies tradition and washes the feet of the disabled, women and those of other faiths. Why he ordered showers to be built for the poor in St. Peter's Square. All of this is appealing, but it's more than that. In my mind, it's his tone. When Pope Francis said, "If a person is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?" The comment took me aback. Homosexuality has long been a taboo subject for the Vatican, yet Pope Francis uttered those welcoming words. Lacroix likened the Pope's approach to Jesus. "Jesus didn't judge. Jesus did not come as a judge. He came as someone who preached and talked about the love of God." Those kinds of answers are so different in my experience, but I understand why more conservative Catholics worry. If the Pope does not judge, then who will tell us who is a sinner and who is not? "I hear that sometimes, too," Lacroix told me. "I think Pope Francis is conservative in the right way. You have to be conservative enough to come back to what is the foundation: that's the Gospel. You cannot reproach Pope Francis of not living the Gospel, or not preaching the truth of the Gospel." But isn't homosexuality a sin in the eyes of the church? "There is room for everyone. The door is open," Cardinal Lacroix insisted. "Of course you know that the Catholic Church will never promote same sex marriage, but do we respect homosexual persons? Do we welcome them? Do we accompany them? Of course. But to respect the Church and its teaching, which is based on a long tradition and also the word of God, we will not go so far as to bless. But that doesn't mean we reject." That last sentiment -- "that doesn't mean we reject." -- did it for me. I finally understood why Pope Francis reawakened my faith. I always felt my church would reject me for committing the smallest of sins. Like calling a priest at a church that was not my home parish. Like not covering my head with a traditional veil at Easter. Like accidentally eating meat on Holy Friday. Like supporting the use of contraception. But as Lacroix told me, Jesus walked with sinners until the very end. He did not banish them to fires of hell, for He refused to give up on anyone. The Cardinal's last words to me: "I'm trying to do my best on (the) local level -- to have an open ear to what the church and world are experiencing. To see how we can today respond to those needs. I want people to see me, and the church, as an open heart to grow together. Not a church that's imposing -- we have nothing to impose -- we have someone to propose: the Lord Jesus and his Gospel." I can't wait to go church next Sunday. And, yes, I will bow my head and pray for forgiveness, and if I'm worthy, Christ's love.

Rojo went away during a week off for his club side, pictured with team-mate Angel di Maria on the plane, after United's 3-1 victory over Aston Villa on Saturday. The Argentina international is impressing in defence under Louis van Gaal in his first season in the Premier League, though it his time off the field in Manchester that has recently come into question.

Fitness instructor Sarah Watson, 34, claims Rojo and his advisors tried to frame her for blackmail after she enjoyed a brief liaison with the United star following a night out. Rojo's identity in the case was originally held back as a 'Premier League footballer' though the details have now been revealed. She said: ‘He came over to me and sat down. His English was quite bad but he was chatty and said nice things to me about how I looked and how he liked my Versace dress. ‘He said “You’re gorgeous, you’re the best looking girl in here.” It was all very cheesy, but he’s so good looking that I gave him my number.’ Rojo invited her to his friend’s flat for a more private party, but she declined and they parted. He then sent a text at 2am. “My love, where are you?” he asked. ‘It was a bit of an ego boost for me. There were a lot of young, pretty girls that night, but he wanted me.’ So she and a girlfriend booked a taxi to the address he sent her. When they arrived at the flat in the centre of the city, a friend of Rojo’s – known in court as Mr X but who now can be named as Kristian Bereit – made a shocking proposition. ‘He asked me how much it would cost for me to have sex with Marcos. I told him that I was not a prostitute.’ But she did find the Argentine star’s dusky looks attractive and they ended up in a bedroom. ‘I did it because I liked him, not for money or with any intention to sell the story on,’ she said. The Argentine defender was in action for Manchester United against Aston Villa on Saturday. Rojo celebrates with team-mate Di Maria after the 3-1 victory at Old Trafford in the Premier League. Watson says that the 25-year-old offered her money to spend the night with him - which she declined - and then accepted a £30,000 offer from a newspaper to sell her story. She never received that money, and Sarah then says Rojo's representatives tried to entrap her with promises of cash to spin the story. Watson said: ‘[Rojo] and his people contrived to make me look like a greedy cow, when it was them who offered me £100,000 as hush money.' Last month Mr Justice Warby made a ruling in the High Court that overturned the gagging order and ordered Rojo to pay Sarah’s estimated £25,000 legal costs. The defender has not spoken about the incident publicly, while his friend Bereit - who Sarah claims offered her the money - declined to comment. Watching from the stands as Rojo impressed at Old Trafford against Tim Sherwood's side at the weekend, was his wife Eugenia Lusardo, a lingerie model based in Lisbon, and their young daughter, Morena. Both are pictured with Rojo as he enjoyed a meal in Lisbon, the city he used to ply his trade in with Sporting before signing for United last summer. Rojo's wife, Eugenia Lusardo (pictured with Rojo last month) is a lingerie model.

Article: New York (CNN)When Liana Barrientos was 23 years old, she got married in Westchester County, New York. A year later, she got married again in Westchester County, but to a different man and without divorcing her first husband.  Only 18 days after that marriage, she got hitched yet again. Then, Barrientos declared "I do" five more times, sometimes only within two weeks of each other. In 2010, she married once more, this time in the Bronx. In an application for a marriage license, she stated it was her "first and only" marriage. Barrientos, now 39, is facing two criminal counts of "offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree," referring to her false statements on the 2010 marriage license application, according to court documents. Prosecutors said the marriages were part of an immigration scam. On Friday, she pleaded not guilty at State Supreme Court in the Bronx, according to her attorney, Christopher Wright, who declined to comment further. After leaving court, Barrientos was arrested and charged with theft of service and criminal trespass for allegedly sneaking into the New York subway through an emergency exit, said Detective Annette Markowski, a police spokeswoman. In total, Barrientos has been married 10 times, with nine of her marriages occurring between 1999 and 2002.  All occurred either in Westchester County, Long Island, New Jersey or the Bronx. She is believed to still be married to four men, and at one time, she was married to eight men at once, prosecutors say. Prosecutors said the immigration scam involved some of her husbands, who filed for permanent residence status shortly after the marriages.  Any divorces happened only after such filings were approved. It was unclear whether any of the men will be prosecuted. The case was referred to the Bronx District Attorney's Office by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security's Investigation Division. Seven of the men are from so-called "red-flagged" countries, including Egypt, Turkey, Georgia, Pakistan and Mali. Her eighth husband, Rashid Rajput, was deported in 2006 to his native Pakistan after an investigation by the Joint Terrorism Task Force. If convicted, Barrientos faces up to four years in prison.  Her next court appearance is scheduled for May 18.

Article: Lewis Hamilton has described his ongoing contract issues as 'a pain in the backside' as the reigning Formula One world champion has become mired in paperwork. Following the Malaysian Grand Prix 11 days ago Hamilton claimed his new deal with Mercedes, worth an estimated £21million per year, was '99.6 per cent done' and was now in the hands of his lawyers. But the fine print of the terms and conditions means the 30-year-old, who opted on this occasion - and for the first time in his career - to negotiate for himself without an agent, is becoming frustrated. Lewis Hamilton, who leads the world championship after two races, is pictured in the Shanghai paddock. The British sporting star was sporting two gold chains ahead of this week's Chinese Grand Prix. Lewis Hamilton, pictured at a Hugo Boss promotional event, says his Mercedes contract has not been sorted. The British world champion admits issues with paperwork has been 'a pain in the backside' According to Hamilton it now means 'it is unlikely' the contract will be signed ahead of this weekend's Chinese Grand Prix. Speaking to Sky Sports News, Hamilton added: 'Obviously at the last race I said it would be done within a week. 'This is my first time negotiating myself and you don't know how many times I've had to read about 80 pages. 'It is so much reading and it is all in lawyer jargon, so it has been quite a pain in the backside to be honest.' Despite the issues with the new deal, Hamilton is favourite to return to the top step of the podium on Sunday at the Shanghai International Circuit. Hamilton is a three-time winner at the venue - including last year - whilst he has finished in the top three on three other occasions. Hamilton is surrounded by the media at the Hugo Boss event in Shanghai on Wednesday. Mercedes driver Hamilton and team-mate Nico Rosberg (right) were beaten by Sebastian Vettel in Malaysia. Despite Ferrari winning their first race for almost two years last time out in Malaysia, with Sebastian Vettel at the wheel, the much cooler conditions in China should play into Mercedes' hands. 'Malaysia was a tough weekend,' said Hamilton. 'It always is with the heat, but with car problems on Friday, rain during qualifying on Saturday and a race which didn't go to plan on Sunday, that one was particularly challenging. 'Ultimately we made the best choices we could, but there is always room for improvement and we've been working hard to analyse everything for this next race in China. 'The circuit is one I really enjoy and it suits my driving style quite well. 'I won the race last year and have only finished outside of the podium places twice, so the target is definitely to build on that and get back to the front.' Hamilton, pictured driving during final practice in Malaysia, says the last Grand Prix was a 'tough weekend' He won last year in China and will be hoping for more joy in Shanghai this weekend.

Article: Washington (CNN)Washington was rocked late Thursday by shootings -- one at the gates of the U.S. Census Bureau's headquarters and another in a popular area packed with restaurant patrons. The shootings were connected, authorities said. They began with what authorities believe was a domestic kidnapping incident, according to D.C. Police Chief Cathy Lanier. The suspect's vehicle was spotted outside the Census Bureau, which is in Suitland, Maryland. A guard apparently approached the vehicle and saw two people arguing. That guard was then shot at least once in the upper body, said Prince George's County Fire Department spokesman Mark Brady. The guard was in extremely critical condition, according to Brady. The police chief said the suspect then fled the scene. Officers picked up the chase, and the suspect fired gunshots at multiple locations, Lanier said. The chase ended in a crash on Washington's busy H Street. A shootout ensues, Lanier said. An officer and the suspect were wounded, according to the police chief. Both were conscious and talking when they left the scene. "Right now, we have every reason to believe that the car that we have in this last incident here is the same car involved and the same person involved in the kidnapping," she said. Lanier told reporters the kidnapping victim was located and is in good condition. She did not identify the suspect, nor the guard, nor the officer who were injured. Steve Brusk reported from Washington. Dana Ford wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Greg Botelho also contributed to this report.

Article: Palmerston remains a very painful place for Rangers managers. Consider this the first harsh lesson of Stuart McCall’s tenure. Back in the chill of mid-December, Ally McCoist led the Ibrox side here on the day it emerged he had handed in his notice of resignation. A convincing 2-0 defeat did nothing to alleviate the mood of gloomy chaos that had engulfed the club. Nine days later, McCoist was out on gardening leave. Fast forward almost five months, and Rangers arrived here in far more ebullient spirits with a new boardroom regime installed and three successive victories under McCall’s command. That Hibs and Hearts were among the victims added to the sense of a substantial revival. In Dumfries, however, it felt more like a flashback to the bad old days of their campaign. Rangers were simply second-best all over the plastic pitch in Dumfries. Striker Derek Lyle points to the skies after putting Queen of the South in the lead at Palmerston Park. Lewis Kidd celebrates after an own goal doubles Queen of the South's lead at the start of the second half. Gavin Reilly (left) celebrates after forcing an own goal for  QOTS's third to dent Rangers' second place hopes. Queen of the South: Clark, Durnan (Hooper), Dowie, Higgins, Kidd, McShane, Carmichael, McKenna, Holt, Lyle (Pickard), Reilly (Russell) Subs: Paton, Atkinson, Smith, Smith. Booked: Higgins. Scorers: Lyle 33', Wallace (og) 46', Reilly 69' Rangers: Robinson, McGregor, Zaliukas, Mohsni, Wallace, Templeton (Crawford), Law, Murdoch, Vuckic, Miller (Hardie), Clark (Boyd) Subs: Black, Shiels, Simonsen, Sinnamon. Booked: Templeton, Moshni. Ref: Don Robertson. Att: 5,093. Immense credit must go to Queens, who recorded a thoroughly merited victory that has significantly boosted their play-off hopes. Under James Fowler, they are capable of bright, energetic football that delivered goals from Derek Lyle and Gavin Reilly, as well an own goal from Lee Wallace. McCall, though, must have felt a twinge of despair. He has spent much of his recent time emphasising that nothing had been achieved by the recent uplift. That so much work still had to be done were they to achieve their aim of promotion. A first defeat of his six-game reign confirmed that assessment in the most emphatic fashion. The Ibrox outfit remain third behind Hibs on goal difference, albeit with a game still in hand. Radical improvement is once again required when they host Raith Rovers on Sunday. Queens will face Falkirk at that same time, having just overhauled their key rivals for the fourth and final play-off spot. This was the best possible fillip for Fowler’s men, as they seek to grow that one-point advantage. Ranger's Newcastle loanee Haris Vukic (left) attempts to block a shot by QOTS' Chris Higgins. New manager Stuart McCall (right) suffered his first defeat since taking charge of the Ibrox club. Rangers were without suspended skipper Lee McCulloch – banned after a red card for an elbow on Hearts’ Osman Sow at the weekend – which meant a starting role for Bilel Mohsni alongside Marius Zaliukas at the heart of the defence. There was little to trouble either backline in the initial exchanges, as the game developed at a rather sedate pace. McCall watched it unfold pensively. Clearly, what he was seeing wasn’t to his liking. His side did have flickers of threat early on, but they often owed much to fortune. Andy Murdoch saw a mis-hit cross clawed out by Zander Clark, before a similar delivery from David Templeton looped fractionally over. The winger was another change to McCall’s line-up and he saw plenty of the ball before the break, without making it amount to a great deal. QOTS's Kidd (left) Rangers fends off David Templeton of Rangers as he runs with the ball. Lyle (2nd left) opened the scoring following a first-half corner in the 3-0 defeat of Rangers. Lyle (centre) wheels away after putting the hosts in front with a strike on 33minutes. One neat bit of skill saw him drift infield from the left flank before thumping a shot just too high. Another powerful swipe was blocked by Andy Dowie’s head – at the expense of ringing ears. Queens had offered even less up front throughout this spell, but suddenly sprang into life to claim the lead after 33 minutes with pretty much their first serious attack. Daniel Carmichael swept play wide to Lewis Kidd who took on Wallace. The Ibrox left-back toppled, apparently looking for a foul that wasn’t there, allowing Kidd to break into the penalty area. His cut-back found Lyle, who took a touch on his left foot before dispatching a sweet finish off his right. The home fans roared approval, barely having time to draw breath before the advantage was very nearly doubled. Lyle set up Reilly and his daisy-cutter drew a fine stop from Lee Robinson at full stretch. The QOTS striker acknowledges the home supporters after making the score 1-0 in the first half. Play continues as a flare is let off in the Rangers section of the crowd at Palmerston Park. QOTS goalkeeper Zander Clark ensures Rangers' Bilel Mohsni does not find the back of the net. Rangers used the shock to stir them into greater vigour. Nicky Clark was close with a brave effort from a Darren McGregor cross, which led to him being flattened by his namesake in the Queens goal. Then, after a Haris Vuckic corner caused uncertainty, Kenny Miller sent a looping header against the bar. The first half duly closed with a penalty shout from Wallace after he tangled with Mark Durnan. Referee Don Robertson remained unmoved. Far worse followed for Wallace 16 seconds after the restart as he got the final touch to his side’s second concession of the evening. Kidd celebrates after forcing an own goal from Rangers Lee Wallace immediately after the break. QOTS's Gavin Reilly (left) demonstrates a calm finish to put his side 3-0 to the good. Ibrox minds still appeared to be in the dressing room as Reilly surged into the box and sent a low cross speeding through the six yard box. It reached Kidd beyond the far post, who angled a drive back towards goal. Off balance, Wallace attempted to clear from the line but only succeeded in helping the ball into the net via his heel. Rangers were rocking. They looked shaken by the energy of their hosts. Fowler’s side seemed to be first to the ball in every area. Templeton collected a booking for diving after attempting to go past Durnan, but creating clear chances remained a trickier task. Not long after, the winger was replaced by Robbie Crawford. Clark saw a deflected effort held, before a Mohnsi effort from distance was shuttled round the post. Yet there still wasn’t a convincing edge to these attacking forays. The fluidity witnessed against Hearts at the weekend had disappeared. Scott Hooper applauds the home support as he leaves the field followed by dejected Rangers players. Queens were now content to try and pick Rangers off when they could. And they notched their clinching third goal after 69 minutes. Holt nicked possession away from Crawford and worked a little exchange that released Reilly. The flag stayed down as he calmly slotted beyond Robinson. Rangers attempted a pride-saving late flurry but found Clark in excellent form in the home goal. Notable saves from Vuckic and substitute Kris Boyd ensured McCall’s side would exit without even a sliver of consolation.

Rangers were beaten by Queen of the South in the Scottish Championship. Derek Lyle opened the scoring for the hosts following a first-half corner. Lee Wallace own goal doubled the Doonhammers' lead after the break. Gavin Reilly completed the upset that dents Gers' hopes of second place.

Article: (CNN)An Amnesty International report is calling for authorities to address the number of attacks on women's rights activists in Afghanistan. The report, entitled "Their Lives on the Line," examines the persecution of activists and other champions of women's rights not only by the Taliban and tribal warlords, but also by government officials. Its publication is timely. The brutal murder of Farkhunda, a young woman in Afghanistan, whose body was burnt and callously chucked into a river in Kabul, shocked the world. Accused of burning pages from the Muslim holy book, the Quran, many protested the 27-year-old's innocence. But what also made international headlines was the fact that for the first time in history, women in Afghanistan became pallbearers, hoisting the victim's coffin on their shoulders draped with headscarves, under the gazes of men; unreservedly sobbing and shouting messages of women's solidarity as they marched along the streets. In a country ranked in 2011 by a Thomson Reuters Foundation poll as the most dangerous place in the world for women, this feminist act seemed perilous. Latest figures suggest they were risking their lives to be heard. In 2013, the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) released statistics that showed the number of women killed in the country had increased by 20% from the previous year, although the number of civilian victims had decreased, said Amnesty in the report. The Special Representative of the U.N. Secretary-General in Afghanistan at the time, Jan Kubis, told the U.N. Security Council that "the majority (of women killed) is linked to domestic violence, tradition, culture of the country. "Women activists have been deliberately targeted." And according to the human rights group, little support has come from those in power. "The Afghan government has done very little to protect them," Amnesty's Afghanistan researcher, Horia Mosadiq, tells CNN. "Perpetrators almost always walk free, and threats reported by women rights defenders are often simply ignored. "Many women defenders we spoke to said that even when they received some protection from authorities, it was often significantly less than what male counterparts or colleagues were afforded." During the attack on Farkhunda, "many eyewitnesses have testified that police officers stood idly by while this woman was being lynched and killed," says Mosadiq. Twenty-six people were arrested and thirteen police officials suspended in connection with the attack, but she argues that this is insufficient. "Suspending police officers is not enough, those who failed in their duty must also be held to account -- anything less will just encourage further mob violence." But what is striking is the resilience of the activists, who continue their work despite their lives being on the line. "It was a remarkable moment," says Mosadiq, recalling the female protesters at Farkhunda's funeral. "Unlike anything I have seen in my decades of campaigning for women's rights in our country." Selay Ghaffer, 32, is a women's rights activist and spokesperson for the Solidarity Party of Afghanistan -- a small but outspoken political party based in Kabul and twenty provinces that fights for issues such as democracy, social justice and women's rights. The party was the first to be banned in the country for accusing Afghan leaders and commanders of war crimes and demanding that they be brought to justice. Taking part in Farkhunda's funeral and protests against her death, she tells CNN that despite the onslaught of violence against Afghan women over the years, this was the worst case. But the opportunity was taken to deliver a clear message. "So the women of Afghanistan showed that we will not keep silent anymore... And we are not ready to accept more brutality and violence against women," said Ghaffer. "So this is why we decided to carry the dead body of Farkhunda on our own shoulders and show to the world that not only men can do it and somehow broke the traditionalism that (a) man has to do this job." Surprisingly, she says that male onlookers supported their mission, although they are in the minority overall in the country. "Men (at the funeral), they said you have to do this, because this is how you can change the hatred in Afghanistan. "Without men, it is not possible for women to get their rights," she says. "So these men and women were working together. But at the same time, women need to step forward for their rights." Mosadiq says the fight for women's rights was established a while ago. "Women's activism in Afghanistan is nothing new -- the women's rights movement has grown substantially since 2001, and has fought for and achieved some very significant gains. "These gains are under threat now, however, and some are even rolled back. It's essential that the government and its international partners do not allow this to happen." Ghaffer herself has been subject to threats because of her work, received through emails and phone calls, at her home and office. But she says she knew what she was getting herself into. "I knew it wasn't an easy task. There might be many challenges and you have to lose your life when you are going and struggling for your rights. "As a woman, I want to struggle more (for my rights), I want to have more people around me, to struggle with me." Mosadiq says it is too soon to talk about a revolution, although the response to Farkhunda's killing, from both men and women, has been a "silver lining." Ghaffer, however, believes this is the beginning of an uprising -- but she says it needs to keep moving. Interestingly, it was a man in her life that motivated her to fight. "I must say strongly that it was my father (who inspired me), who is not any more with me, because he... died three months ago," she says. "He always told me that women always suffered in this country," she says, her voice overcome with emotion. "And you have to struggle for your rights. Because in this traditional, patriarchal society, nobody will give these rights (to) you." She realizes how lucky she is, she adds, in a society where she has witnessed men -- fathers and husbands -- oppressing women as opposed to being their role models. Ghaffer maintains that silence is an injustice to women, not least to the victim of the recent, horrific mob violence. "So if I should not do it, if another sister is not doing it, then who will do it? Who will get the rights for us? We have to struggle for it. "If we keep our silence, more Farkhundas will be killed in this country."

Article: Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has said he hopes Burnley escape relegation after seeing his side have to fight to gain a narrow 1-0 victory at Turf Moor. Wenger has been praised by Burnley boss Sean Dyche this season and last night the Gunners boss repaid the compliment by saying: 'It would be a shame for Burnley to go down.' Arsenal were made to fight hard for their eighth win in a row and Wenger said: 'I understand now why they took points from other teams like Chelsea and Manchester City. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has said he hopes Burnley escape relegation from the Premier League. Burnley manager Sean Dyche shakes hands with Wenger following Arsenal 1-0 victory at Turf Moor. 'When you see their performance tonight (Saturday), I am surprised by their plight near the bottom. They have a great solidarity and organisation in their side. Burnley have won only once in 11 games, a famous 1-0 victory against City, but Dyche still believes they can escape the drop. They are currently two points from safety but face three fellow strugglers Hull City, Leicester City and Aston Villa in their final six fixtures. They have played seven teams at the top of the table in their last eight games. Aaron Ramsey (right) scored the only goal of the game, but it was enough to secure three points. The Welsh midfielder points to the sky as he celebrates putting Arsenal into a early 1-0 lead. 'We have six big games coming and we have shown this season we can score goals,' he said. 'We are not naïve. We are willing and have an appetite to succeed.' 'The outside world thought we might not take anything from our last seven games. There are teams around us who are having an awkward time and maybe they feel the next matches more than us. 'It could well go do the wire. I am only concerned about us. I know if our performances are right, we will win games. I think we have measured ourselves well against the top sides and now there are going to be different type of games, edgy games.' Burnley were unlucky not to draw level after this acrobatic attempt was saved by David Ospina.

Article: (CNN)The University of Michigan has decided to proceed with a screening of the film "American Sniper" despite objections from some students. More than 200 students signed a petition asking the school not to show the movie as part of UMix, a series of social events the university stages for students. Bradley Cooper was nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal of Chris Kyle, a Navy SEAL and the most lethal sniper in U.S. military history. Kyle was fatally shot at a Texas shooting range in 2013. Some students believed the movie's depiction of the Iraq War reflected negatively on the Middle East and people from that region. Michigan's Detroit metropolitan area is home to the nation's largest Arab-American population. But there was a backlash to the decision to yank the movie, and a counter-petition asked school officials to reconsider. On Wednesday, E. Royster Harper, University of Michigan's vice president for student life, said in a statement that "It was a mistake to cancel the showing of the movie 'American Sniper' on campus as part of a social event for students" and that the show will go on. "The initial decision to cancel the movie was not consistent with the high value the University of Michigan places on freedom of expression and our respect for the right of students to make their own choices in such matters," the statement said. UMix will offer a screening of the family-friendly "Paddington" for those who would rather not attend "American Sniper." The announcement drew praise from Michigan head football coach Jim Harbaugh.

Article: Arsene Wenger has branded the emerging trend of post-season tours as a 'nightmare' after revealing Arsenal opted against an extended pre-season trip. Tottenham have confirmed they will travel to Australia and Malaysia at the end of the Premier League season, while Chelsea are also set to travel abroad when the current campaign finishes. Overseas tours are an important component of clubs PR strategies as they look to maximise their earning potential away from England. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has slammed post season tours as a nightmare. Calum Chambers battles with Radamel Falcao during the Emirates Cup pre-season tournament. But they can also cause headaches for managers who feel such tours - particularly pre-season trips - hamper preparations. Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has successfully lobbied for a shorter than anticipated tour of the US this summer. Likewise, Arsenal were exploring the idea of playing additional matches in either India or Malaysia after their initial trip to Singapore - but have decided against it, a decision Wenger is happy with. 'I'm pleased with that because pre-season is always difficult if you cannot prepare well,' said the Arsenal manager. Chelsea are one of several Premier League sides who will be travelling overseas after the season. North London rivals Tottenham will be heading to Australia and Malaysia after the season is done. 'Lets not forget they voted to start early in August next season, which is a bit of nightmare when you think you start on August 8. 'Some players play until June 21 in the Copa America, some in the European Under-21 Championship play until June 14. 'After a season where we have no winter break, I don't see where you go from there to give players a proper rest. It's impossible. 'It is difficult because of the commercial aspect but you want to find a compromise.' Louis van Gaal has successfully lobbied for Manchester United's US tour to be cut short. On the prospect of the Gunners organising a future post-season tour, Wenger, who's side face Burnley on Saturday, added: 'Post season tours are a nightmare - I will never do it. 'In pre-season you have the players under pressure with the focus of starting the season well. 'A post-season tour, I always feel people come along to watch but the players are half on their holidays. 'It is a relaxed atmosphere with none of the intensity of a pre-season game. 'Maybe it is a holiday tour and good to have a relaxed atmosphere together. But from a purely football point of view, there is not much meaning – let’s be honest.'

Article: New Delhi  (CNN)An Indian software pioneer and nine others have been sentenced to seven years in jail for their role in what has been dubbed India's biggest corporate scandal in memory, police said. Ramalinga Raju, the former chairman of software services exporter Satyam Computers Services, was also fined $804,000, R.K. Gaur, a spokesman for India's Central Bureau of Investigation, told CNN. In 2009, Satyam Computers Services was at the center of a massive $1.6 billion fraud case after its then-chairman Raju admitted inflating profits with fictitious assets and nonexistent cash. Investigators say losses to investors resulting from the company's book manipulation were much higher. A special court convicted Raju and nine other people of cheating, criminal conspiracy, breach of public trust and other charges, said the Central Bureau of Investigation, which looked into the case. In the media, the case has been compared to the 2001 Enron Corp. scandal, in which a Houston energy company's earnings had been overstated by several hundred million dollars. When the scam made headlines, Satyam, which means "truth" in Sanskrit, was India's fourth-largest software services provider. It was serving almost 700 companies, including 185 Fortune 500 companies, and generated more than half of its revenue from the United States. The company had about 53,000 employees and operated in 65 countries. After Raju's shock disclosures six years ago, the Indian government fired Satyam's board. In a subsequent state-backed auction, the company was bought by Tech Mahindra, part of the country's Mahindra Group.

Article: Conor O’Shea has revealed his concern at the increasing force of rugby’s collisions after Harlequins and England full back Mike Brown was consigned to even more time on the sidelines to recover from the latest high-profile head injury. Brown has not played since the final round of the RBS 6 Nations on March 21, is still suffering headaches after a week-long holiday in Dubai and no closer to being declared symptom-free. The episode raises questions about whether the 29-year-old was brought back too early for England’s title-decider against France, having been knocked out in the Test against Italy five weeks earlier following a crunching collision with Andrea Masi. Mike Brown is knocked out in a collision with Italy’s Andrea Masi in the Six Nations last month. Brown was out cold for approximately eight minutes and hasn't played since the Italy game on March 21st. ‘It’s a concern because I don’t like someone coming in with something you can’t diagnose,’ said O’Shea, Quins’ director of rugby. ‘Sometimes a physio will sit you down and say, “It’s six to 12 weeks out”. Here it could be tomorrow or it could be whenever — we don’t have a timescale. There’s no doubt that a decade or even a year ago Browny would be back out on the pitch. ‘You want to see the gladiatorial side of things — the big hits that we’ve all grown up with. It was once a badge of honour that you got up and got on with it. But at least we’re now aware. Is it a concern for the game that we’re seeing collisions of the nature that we are? Yes, it has to be.’ Brown will have played just six of his club’s last 19 games after sitting out of the coming weekend, and his England team-mates Joe Marler and Chris Robshaw have featured in only eight of the last 18. Northampton have ruled out George North, who is suffering from his own concussion problems after being knocked out in three different collisions, until the end of the month and O’Shea must also deal with the absence of one of his marquee players. George North suffered his third concussion in four months during Northampton's defeat to Wasps. ‘You can look at a succession of events for George North, whereas this is a follow-on of symptoms from one event,’ said O’Shea. ‘Against Italy it was as big a hit as I’ve seen someone take. It was quite frankly a monstrous hit. I was pretty worried when I saw it live. ‘Is it tough on us having the England full back for six out of 19 games and still indeterminate? Yes, but there are more important things than rugby.’

Article: (CNN)A 32-year-old Massachusetts man is facing murder charges, authorities said Wednesday, four days after another man's remains were found in a duffel bag. The Middlesex District Attorney's Office said that Carlos Colina, 32, will be arraigned the morning of April 14 for murder in connection with the remains discovered Saturday in Cambridge. Earlier this week, Colina was arraigned on charges of assault and battery causing serious bodily injury and improper disposal of a body. A Middlesex County judge then revoked bail for Colina in another case he's involved in, for alleged assault and battery. The victim in that case is different from the one whose remains were found in recent days. Police were notified Saturday morning about a suspicious item along a walkway in Cambridge. Officers arrived at the scene, opened a duffel bag and found human remains. After that discovery, police say, a surveillance video led them to an apartment building, where more body parts were discovered in a common area. That location is near the Cambridge Police Department headquarters. The remains at both locations belonged to the same victim, identified Monday as Jonathan Camilien, 26. Camilien and Colina knew each other, according to authorities. "This was a gruesome discovery," District Attorney Marian Ryan said. CNN's Kevin Conlon contributed to this report.

Article: Masters Wednesday began on a sombre note when Australian Marc Leishman, who got so close to victory in 2013 before finishing tied fourth behind countryman Adam Scott, had to withdraw. His wife Audrey spent part of last week in an induced coma owing to a serious infection. Leishman left Augusta taking with him the best wishes of his sport. Marc Leishman has withdrawn from this year's competition to be with his wife. Masters chairman Billy Payne talked a lot  about growing the game but he ruled out any idea of starting a women’s Masters. ‘We have a very short member season at Augusta National of seven months,’ he explained. ‘The time that we dedicate to the preparation and conduct of the tournament is already extensive. I don’t think we would ever host another one.’ Billy Payne has ruled out starting a women's Masters despite talking about growing the game. It’s well-known the garish surroundings outside Augusta National contrast markedly with the beauty within. But maybe that’s about to change. After buying up all the houses on adjacent Berckmans Road and turning it into a patrons’ car park, Masters chairman Billy Payne is promising a ‘beautification’ project. ‘As you know, we’re pretty good at landscaping,’ he said. ‘It’s going to look nice, I promise.’ Mr Unpopular Bubba Watson can surely not have upset anyone with his choice of menu for the Champions Dinner on Tuesday. Clearly he enjoyed it so much two years ago he decided to stick with the same inoffensive offering: Caesar salad followed by grilled chicken breast with green beans, mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese and cornbread. Bubba Watson was recently voted the most unpopular golfer on tour by his fellow professionals. Favourite pic of the week so far? It might well be Arnold Palmer, clad in his green jacket, snapped under the Oak Tree in front of the clubhouse alongside Niall Horan, the keen golf-playing member of One Direction but better known in these parts as Rory McIlroy’s par three caddy. Talk about a game that spans the generations. Arnold Palmer shakes hands with Niall Horan ahead of the 79th instalment of the Masters. The famous Eisenhower Tree on the 17th hole might have gone following an ice storm last year but it has certainly not been forgotten. The club unveiled a mounted cross-section of the tree that will remain on show in the press building this week before being presented to the Eisenhower Library in Kansas for permanent display. The tree was named after the American President after he kept hitting it with his drives. A section of the Eisenhower tree is displayed during a news conference at the Masters. Jack Nicklaus showed he’s still got it at the age of 75 with a hole in one at the fourth in the Par-3 contest. But he couldn’t match Colombian Camilo Villegas who recorded two, at the fourth and eighth. Camilo Villegas recorded two aces during the Par-3 contest, beating Jack Nicklaus' solitary hole-in-one.

The first-leg of the highly anticipated tie will take place at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday. Speaking to the club's official website, defender Adriano warned his team-mates ahead of the game they must be at their absolute best if they are to overcome PSG's star-studded squad, which includes the likes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Thiago Silva and Lucas Moura. He said, 'We have to be alert throughout the match. If we make any mistakes, even small ones, they have excellent players that can break the game.'

Adriano conceded that 'this game will be tricky' and said Barcelona must brace themselves for PSG to 'come at us with a lot more intensity' than they did earlier in the season. Claudio Bravo (centre) enjoys a joke with his team-mates during the training session before facing PSG.

Laurent Blanc's side boast five Brazil internationals - in Silva, Lucas, Marquinhos, Maxwell and David Luiz. And Adriano was quick to heap praise on his fellow countrymen - 'all of them are excellent players' - but noted Lucas in particular as the main threat for the opposition. 'Lucas we know is a dangerous player. In the games we've seen him, he's a player who's very difficult to cover.'

Article: Washington (CNN)An Iranian military observation aircraft flew within 50 yards of an armed U.S. Navy helicopter over the Persian Gulf this month, sparking concern that top Iranian commanders might not be in full control of local forces, CNN has learned. The incident, which has not been publicly disclosed, troubled U.S. military officials because the unsafe maneuver could have triggered a serious incident. It also surprised U.S. commanders because in recent months Iranian forces have conducted exercises and operations in the region in a professional manner, one U.S. military official told CNN. "We think this might have been locally ordered," the official said. The incident took place as the U.S. and other world powers meet with Iran in Switzerland to negotiate a deal limiting Tehran's nuclear program. At the same time, Iran has been active in supporting proxies in several hotspots in the Persian Gulf and neighboring regions. The Navy MH-60R armed helicopter was flying from the deck of the USS Carl Vinson on a routine patrol in international airspace, the official said. An unarmed Iranian observation Y-12 aircraft approached. The Iranian aircraft made two passes at the helicopter, coming within 50 yards, before the helicopter moved off, according to the official. The official said the helicopter deliberately broke off and flew away in a 'predictable' manner so the Iranians could not misinterpret any U.S. intentions. The Navy helicopter was in radio contact with the ship during the encounter, but there was no contact between the two aircraft and no shots were fired. The Navy crew took photos of the incident but the military is not releasing them. The U.S. administration is considering a potential demarche protest against Iran, the official said. CNN has reached out to Iranian officials but has not received a response. This type of Iranian observation aircraft generally operates over the Gulf several times a month. But after the recent incident, U.S. naval intelligence did not see it again for two weeks, leading to the conclusion that the incident may have been ordered by a local commander who was then reprimanded by higher-ups. The Pentagon has noted for the last several years that most encounters with the Iranian military at sea or in air are conducted professionally, but that some missions run by Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps forces have been too aggressive against U.S. forces in the area. The U.S. military's concern has been that one of these incidents could escalate into a military encounter. This incident "might have been buffoonery" the official said, but there is always a risk from such actions. The incident comes as the Navy patrols the Gulf of Aden to watch for Iranian ships the U.S. believes are trying to bring weapons to resupply the Houthi rebels in Yemen. The Navy would share such intelligence with Saudi Arabia, a second U.S. official told CNN.

Article: (CNN)When photographer Johan Bavman became a father for the first time, he took more than a passing wonder about how his native Sweden is said to be the most generous nation on Earth for parental leave. He immersed himself in fatherhood -- twice over, you might say. He used his photography to document the real-life experience of other fathers taking full advantage of Sweden's extraordinary program, which allows mothers and fathers to take long, long leaves from their careers so they can care for their newborns. Get this: Sweden grants a total of 480 calendar days of parental leave, with 390 of them paid at 80% of income, with a maximum of 3,160 euros a month or $3,474. The remaining 90 days are paid at a flat-rate benefit of 20 euros a day, or $22. But there's a catch. Fathers have to share that leave with mothers. So to promote both parents to raise their children, Sweden has mandated that 60 of the 480 days be "daddy months" or "partner months." If the 60 daddy days aren't used, they are lost, reducing the maximum leave to 420 days. The country also created a "gender equality bonus": the more days that parents share the leave equally, they get a bonus that could total up to 1,500 euros, or $1,649. The idea is for both parents to share the joys and struggles of raising infants. In reality, only 12% of Swedish couples equally share the 480 days of leave, Bavman said, with women continuing to lead the way as the stay-at-home parent and men as the careerist. Still, Bavman mused last summer about how the policy impacts those men who use the full measure of their parental leave. Social media. Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. At first, Bavman had difficulty finding such men. But the fathers he did find and photograph, he captured their devotion in realistic imagery. "I realized while I was talking to these dads, these dads are struck by how important the bonding is between you and the children," said Bavman, who now has a 3-year-old son, Viggo, with partner Linda Stark, a freelance journalist. "I didn't want to bring out fathers as superdads," Bavman said. "I wanted to bring out these role models which people can connect to. "I want to have those dads who can also show their tiredness... which comes with being home with your children. It's a hard full-time job. This is something that we have been taking for granted for hundreds of years. This is something that mothers have never been recognized for." He also found moments of humor, with one child nearly ripping apart the shirt of his busy father. The fathers have become more understanding of their wives and even their own mothers, Bavman said. Some are now considering a career change to accommodate their parenthood. "Being home nine months, they get time to think about their life," the photographer said. Bavman is looking for a total of 60 fathers to photograph, to culminate in an exhibition and a book. So far he's found 35 worthy of his lens. Johan Bavman is a freelance photographer based in Malmo, Sweden. From 2008-2011, he worked as a staff photographer at Sydsvenskan, one of Sweden's largest newspapers.

Article: Everton defender John Stones was the shock name on Barcelona’s shopping list of central defenders last summer. Barcelona ended up signing 31-year-old Jeremy Mathieu from Valencia for £14.5m and 29-year-old Thomas Vermaelen from Arsenal for £15m but influential voices at the Catalan club urged then sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta to bid for 20-year-old Stones instead. According to El Pais, Barcelona were desperate for defensive reinforcements at the end of last season. The former Barnsley defender  moved himself up the list of possible targets with performances for Everton that saw the youngster on the stand-by list for England’s World Cup campaign in Brazil. Everton defender John Stones was on Barcelona's list of defensive transfer targets last summer. Barcelona were desperate for reinforcements and Stones' performances  caught the eye of the Catalans. His ability to play at right-back as well as centre-back played in his favour with the club preparing for the likely departure of Dani Alves currently in the final year of his contract and Barcelona's preference for central defenders with the mobility and technique to play at full-back. In the end Barcelona coach Luis Enrique insisted on the signing of Mathieu – another who can also fill-in at full-back - and Stones signed a new £30,000-a-week five-year deal keeping him at Everton until 2019. The contract was seen as a rebuff to Chelsea who were following Stones but it now also seems to have been in response to interest from La Liga leaders Barcelona. Stones signed a new £30,000-a-week five year deal keeping him at Everton until 2019. French defender Mathieu has been a success at the Camp Nou but Vermaelen is yet to start a game for Barcelona. The Belgian arrived with a hamstring injury sustained at the World Cup and never played more than a friendly against an Indonesian XI before having an operation in Finland in December to remedy the problem. He is now training with team-mates but still some way off match fitness and while he could be available for the last month of the season Barcelona have no margin of error in the league and he may have to wait until next season to make his first start. With Vermaelen struggling to regain fitness and both Mathieu and Javier Mascherano having reached 30, Barcelona – who cannot sign anyone until January 2016 because of a Fifa ban – have not forgotten about Stones, who turns 21 at the end of May. Barcelona ended up signing Valencia defender Jeremy Mathieu who netted against Celta Vigo on Sunday. Thomas Vermaelen also moved to the Nou Camp from Arsenal but is yet to start a game for Barcelona.

Article: (CNN)Craig Hicks, who is charged in the deaths of three Muslim college students in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, earlier this year, can face the death penalty, a judge ruled Monday, according to CNN affiliates. Superior Court Judge Orlando Hudson Jr. ruled that Hicks' case is "death penalty qualified," WRAL and WTVD reported. The 46-year-old was arrested February 10 in the deaths of Yusor Mohammad, 21, her 23-year-old husband, Deah Shaddy Barakat, and 19-year-old sister, Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha. All three were shot in the head. Hicks, who was the victims' neighbor, turned himself in to police the night of the killings. The next week, he was indicted on three counts of first-degree murder and a count of discharging a firearm into an occupied dwelling. He had no prior criminal record, police said. Police said "an ongoing neighbor dispute over parking" might have been a factor in the shootings but also said they weren't dismissing the possibility of a hate crime. On what is believed to be Hicks' Facebook page, numerous posts rail against religion. The victims' family members have called on authorities to investigate the slayings as a hate crime. The U.S. Department of Justice issued a statement in February saying the department's Civil Rights Division, along with the the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of North Carolina and the FBI, have opened "a parallel preliminary inquiry" to determine whether any federal laws, including hate crime laws, were violated. "It has always been our position that Mr. Hicks should be held responsible for his actions to the full extent of the law. His killing of three college students was despicable, and now he must face the consequences of his actions," said Rob Maitland, an attorney for Hicks' wife. Karen and Craig Hicks are in the process of divorce.

Article: Louis van Gaal believes Manchester United will hit the ground running in their attempt to win the Barclays Premier League next season after persuading the Old Trafford hierarchy to agree to a short and sharp pre-season tour of America in July. After last summer’s mammoth trek across the United States, an angry United manager Van Gaal vowed that it would never happen again on his watch and believes to this day that the effects of the pre-season schedule cost his side dearly when the real action started. Now Sportsmail can reveal that Van Gaal and United have turned down offers from Asia and Australia and are about to sign off a visit to America – in all likelihood to the west coast. The trip will last in the region of 12 days – a whole week shorter than last summer - and will be over by August 1. Manchester United beat Real Madrid in Michigan last summer in front of 109,000 fans. United played four games in America last pre-season, here Wayne Rooney scores against LA Galaxy. United beat Liverpool in the final to win the International Champions Cup last summer. While rivals such as Manchester City are trekking around Australia, Van Gaal and his United players will operate out of one base in America and travel to their games from there. The club have agreed once again to rake part in the International Champions Cup that they won last summer by beating Liverpool in a final in Miami. The tournament is played all over America but this time the promoters have essentially allowed United to choose their own venues as they are so desperate to have England’s most famous club in it. Details of the competition were supposed to be announced last week with United given a provisional deadline to commit to their schedule by last Friday. However, the announcement has been put on hold while Van Gaal and United tweak final details. Last season, Van Gaal joined United after the World Cup in Brazil to find the club committed to a two-and-half week marathon comprising visits to Los Angeles, Pasadena, Denver, Washington, Detroit and, finally, Miami. Rooney scored another spectacular goal for United against Aston Villa last weekend. Following their tour of America, United suffered a slow start but are now firing on all cylinders in the league. The Dutch veteran was furious at the itinerary that he felt asked too much of his players as they were constantly asked to fly in to different time zones and even play at altitude in Colorado. Having to then play the final in Florida during a thunderstorm was the final straw. For long periods of this winter’s negotiations, Van Gaal and United seemed set to commit to a schedule on America’s East Coast. It is understand, however, that Van Gaal has recently performed a volte face and expressed a preference for the more agreeable climates of the west. Van Gaal has insisted this time that his team will travel to match venues from one base and will have no repeat of the arduous treks endured to games in Pasadena and Ann Arbor last year. One possible base is the Seattle Seahawks training camp on America’s north-west coast. The Premier League season starts early this year, with the competition kicking off on August 8.

Manchester United will embark on a short tour of America this summer. They are likely to spend 12 days on the west coast, staying in one place.

Article: College basketball player Lauren Hill lost her battle with cancer on Friday morning, aged just 19. The Indiana native, who was diagnosed with a rare form of brain cancer shortly after her 18th birthday, had defied doctors' expectations after they told her that she would not live past December. Instead, she played four games with her team at Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati and raised more than $1.5 million for research into the cancer, Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma. But as her condition worsened, she became an honorary coach and earlier this year, she moved to Cincinnati Children's Hospital, where she passed away on Friday morning. Scroll down for video. Loss: Lauren Hill, who is pictured playing for Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati in November, died in hospital on Friday - aged just 19 - after a brave battle with a rare form of brain cancer. Just a year and a half ago, Hill was just another high school student getting ready for college after she decided to play basketball at Mount St. Joseph. A few weeks later, she started experiencing dizziness while playing for her high school team in nearby Lawrenceburg, Indiana. Tests found the tumor and she was told that she had less than two years left. But in September, doctors told her she wouldn't make it past December - and after years as a standout high school basketball player, Hill's hopes of playing college ball were put in jeopardy. But the NCAA granted permission to move the school's opening game forward because of her worsening condition, and on November 2, she realized her dream of playing for the school. She scored the first and last baskets of the team's 66-55 victory over Hiram College. 'It's a dream come true,' she said. 'To play on a college court, to put my foot down on the floor and hear the roar of the crowd - I just love it so much. I love basketball. 'Everything that happened today was amazing. I'm truly happy, it's a really good day.' Diagnosis: Lauren is pictured left in December 2013 and right in December 2014 after her treatment for Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma, a rare childhood brain cancer, changed her appearance. Brave: Hill, who used her limited energy to inspire people and raise money for research into the cancer that ultimately took her life, is pictured in her room in Cincinnati last December. Final days: Lauren is pictured enjoying Easter and St Patrick's Day from hospital in Cincinnati. At the game, she said she wanted to find a cure for the rare cancer, which has a less than 10 per cent survival rate and most often affects children aged four to nine. Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a type of brain tumor found in the part of the brainstem at the lower back of the brain. Due to the tumor's location, it can cause double vision, difficulty controlling eye movement and facial expressions, and difficulty swallowing and chewing. It may also cause weakness in the limbs. The condition primarily affects children most often between the ages of four and nine. Between 100 and 150 new diagnoses are made a year in the U.S. Only 300 are made across North America and Europe a year. It can be treated with radiation, but chemotherapy is generally not effective and surgery is impossible due to the spread of the cancer into healthy tissue. Unlike with other childhood cancers, there has been little progress in improving treatments and cure rates for the condition over the last few decades. Fewer than 10 per cent of children with DIPG survive two years after their diagnosis. Source: DIPG Registry. 'When I was diagnosed I remember kind of feeling lonely because nobody understood,' she said following the game, USA Today reported. 'And now that more people know about this story and the awareness of DIPG. 'I'm so happy that people know about it now and that we can get some research going and hopefully find that home run cure for cancer. And even though I'm probably not going to be around to see it, it's going to help a lot of people.' Hill played in four games and made five layups before the spreading tumor made her stop. When the season ended, her team held its annual dinner in the hospital where Hill was being treated. She was also honored at local sporting events and was featured on a box of Wheaties - known as the Breakfast of Champions. The U.S. Basketball Writers Association voted her the Pat Summitt Most Courageous Award, which is normally awarded at the Final Four. Athletes from other colleges autographed No. 22 jerseys - her number - and sent them in support. As the cancer slowed her down, her family, friends and teammates took a bigger role in promoting her fundraising campaign - and she kept reminding everyone to appreciate life. 'Life is precious,' she told WKRC-TV. 'Every moment you get with someone is a moment that's blessed, really blessed.' The co-founder of her nonprofit foundation confirmed Lauren's death in hospital on Friday.

'Through Lauren's fundraising and advocacy efforts, she not only became a spotlight on the lack of funding for cancer research, but she most certainly has become a beacon guiding researchers for years to come,' The Cure Starts Now co-founder Brooke Desserich said. Her nonprofit foundation helped to raise more than $1.5 million for cancer research. 'She's made an impact on the world, more so than me - more than I ever will do,' her coach Dan Benjamin said. 'I've gotten so many emails and phone calls from all over the world. People are contacting me because they want to share her story.' No information about a memorial has yet been released but Lawrenceburg Schools superintendent Karl Galey said on Twitter that schools will be prepared to assist staff and students with counseling.

Hill was diagnosed with a rare form of brain cancer when she was 18 and by last September, she was told she would not live past December. She passed away in hospital on Friday after defying doctors' expectations. Last year, the NCAA agreed to bring the season's first game forward so she could achieve her dream of playing collegiate basketball. She ultimately played four games for Mount St. Joseph University before her health forced her to quit and coach instead. She continued to raise awareness for her cancer and raised $1.5 million.

Article: (CNN)Lauren Hill, who took her inspirational fight against brain cancer onto the basketball court and into the hearts of many, has died at age 19. The Indiana woman's story became known around the world last year when she was able to realize her dream of playing college basketball. Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati successfully petitioned the NCAA to move up the opening game of its schedule to accommodate her desire to play. Hill died early Friday. At a ceremony honoring her life on the school's campus Friday afternoon, head coach Dan Benjamin said the toughest thing a coach has to deal with is a loss. The community had lost more than a player, he said. It lost a friend and a daughter. And it lost "an unselfish angel." "It's not often you get to celebrate a loss," he told the crowd as he struggled to hold in his tears. "But today we celebrate a victory on how to live a life, through Lauren Hill. (No.) 22 you will be missed and remembered by so many." An assistant coach read a quote from Hill:. "I encourage everyone to cherish every moment with no worry about the past or anxiety about the future. Because the next moment is never promised. Never leave anything unsaid. I have learned to see the blessings in every moment and through every struggle, no matter how tough it might be. Nothing holds me back from living my life and chasing my dreams. I always finish what I start and see it through to the end. Never give up on your dreams. Find something to fight for; I fight for others." Hill would go on to help raise $1.4 million for pediatric cancer research with the nonprofit group The Cure Starts Now. The organization called her a "worldwide inspiration." "Lauren captured the hearts of people worldwide with her tenacity and determination to play in her first collegiate basketball game with her Mount St. Joseph University team," the group said on Facebook. People we've lost in 2015. Mount St. Joseph University President Tony Artez said Hill's "love and laughter will remain in our hearts." "We are forever grateful to have had Lauren grace our campus with her smile and determined spirit," Artez said in a statement. "She has left a powerful legacy. She taught us that every day is a blessing, every moment a gift." Her principal at Lawrenceburg High School, Bill Snyder, announced her death to students Friday morning. "Lauren's message was constantly positive," he told CNN. "We all need to work together to beat obstacles. Not just cancer. In any situation we can be positive." As news of her death spread, social media lit up with messages honoring her life. NBA great LeBron James called her the "true definition of strength, courage, power, leadership." "The greatest accomplishment we can achieve as humans is to inspire many," Twitter user Just_AP wrote. "Lauren Hill did that." NCAA President Mark Emmert said Hill's "enthusiasm and strength were an inspiration not only to those who knew her best, but also to the millions of people she touched around the world by sharing her story." "Lauren achieved a lasting and meaningful legacy, and her beautiful spirit will continue to live on," he said in a statement. Hill was diagnosed with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma in 2013 when she was a senior in high school. The rare brain tumor was inoperable, but Hill persisted in playing on her high school team despite chemotherapy treatments. "I never gave up for a second, even when I got a terminal diagnosis, never thought about sitting back and not living life anymore," she told CNN affiliate WKRC-TV at the time. She had already committed to play for Mount St. Joseph when she was diagnosed. In October, the school received permission from the NCAA to move up its first scheduled game so Hill could play. In front of a sellout crowd, many wearing T-shirts bearing her name and slogan, "Never Give Up," watched the ballplayer score the first two points and the final layup of the game. "Today has been the best day I've ever had," Hill told the crowd after the game. "I don't know what to say but thank you." CNN's Jill Martin, Emanuella Grinberg and Faith Karimi contributed to this report.

Article: Luis Suarez is quickly establishing himself in Barcelona folklore after impressing since his £75million move from Liverpool and the striker has revealed that years prior, he found himself sneaking into the Nou Camp. Speaking to Spanish radio station COPE, the forward spoke candidly about Real Madrid's interest in signing him and opened up about the infamous bite on Giorgio Chiellini during the World Cup. Suarez revealed that during a visit to his future club, he sneaked into the Nou Camp with his wife Sofia for a photo opportunity. Luis Suarez (9) has revealed that he once sneaked his way into the Nou Camp for a photograph. He said: 'It was not the first time that I came to Barcelona, it was the second. I went past the official store and saw it, but I did not go in because I didn't have money to buy anything. 'I was already going with Sofía and I remember that I saw an open door and I told her: 'Let's go'. 'You're crazy'. 'Come, just one photo'. 'No, no'. 'Yes, yes, yes. I'm going to go in'. I went in through the door that was open, she followed me and we started to run. 'We stood on the stairs and took a photo with all of the stadium behind us. I still haven't found the photo. Then we ran, and we were nervous. It was the only time that I had entered. My father-in-law managed to enter another time to see Argentina-Catalunya, on December 27.' The Uruguayan lit up the 'El Clasico' last month, where he scored the winner to send his side top of La Liga but he could have been playing for the opposition, if he'd not decided to move to Catalonia. The Uruguayan has been in fine form for Barcelona following his move and is becoming a fan's favourite. The forward admitted that Real Madrid were'very' interested in signing him but he only wanted Barca. Talk of a move to the Spanish capital had been rife during his years at Liverpool but Suarez revealed that there was only one club which caught his eye. He said: 'Madrid were very interested in me, but my dream was always Barcelona. When I heard the name of Barca, I did not hesitate at any moment.' Arguably Suarez's most famous, yet controversial moment, when he bit Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil and being banned for four-months. 'The bite on Chiellini was the worst moment of my career,' he said. 'I let myself down, my country, my wife and my children. The bites were partly my fault and partly [due to] the provocation of Ivanovic and Chiellini. Now they continue provoking me, but now I go or speak well. I am more intelligent.' Suarez admits that the bite was the worst moment of his career as he received a four-month playing ban. The attackers bite Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini during the 2014 World Cup group game last July.

Article: (CNN)Chris Copeland of the Indiana Pacers was stabbed after leaving a trendy New York nightclub early Wednesday, and two Atlanta Hawks -- who had just finished a home game hours before the incident -- were among those arrested, according to police and CNN affiliates. The Hawks were not involved in the stabbing incident, police said, but were arrested on obstruction and other charges later. Though New York Police Department Det. Kelly Ort initially told CNN the incident occurred just before 4 a.m. at 1OAK, a club in New York's Chelsea neighborhood known to draw celebrities among its clientele, the club later told CNN that the stabbing occurred in front of the Fulton Houses project down the street. "1OAK staff was unaware of the incident when it happened, as it occurred beyond their view in a different location. However, 1OAK's team assisted Mr. Copeland to their fullest capabilities, and called for help as soon as he was seen walking back towards the venue," the statement said. The statement continued, "A review of the video footage seems to reveal the incident did not originate from the venue or its immediate surroundings that are under 1OAK supervision." Copeland and a female companion, Katrine Saltara, were in the club for about 10 minutes before leaving and walking down the street toward Fulton Houses, where their car was parked, said a 1OAK spokesperson. The spokesperson gave CNN additional details on condition of anonymity because 1OAK's legal team had approved only the club's official statement. The suspect, who the spokesperson said never entered 1OAK, stabbed Copeland and Saltara in front of Fulton Houses, and according to the club's statement, "Mr. Copeland's driver sprang to accost and detain the apparent perpetrator and that individual is now in police custody." Charges against the suspect are pending, and his name will be released once charges are filed, Ort said. Copeland and Saltara tried to make their way back to the club to seek help from the 20 or so security personnel on hand, leaving a "bloody trail of handprints" between the site of the stabbing and the club, the spokesperson said. Copeland "almost landed right next to the club," the spokesperson said, adding that surveillance footage will not show the actual stabbing because it occurred too far away from the club. The club shut down immediately after the incident, the spokesperson said. A male and two females were taken to area hospitals, Ort said. A knife was recovered, a suspect was arrested and two individuals not involved in the dispute -- the Hawks' Pero Antic, 32, and Thabo Sefolosha, 30 -- were arrested on charges of obstructing governmental administration and disorderly conduct, she said. Sefolosha faces an additional charge of resisting arrest, Ort said. Word of the stabbing quickly spread through the club, reaching Antic and Sefolosha, who went outside to check on their friend, Copeland, the 1OAK spokesperson said. At one point, the two began pushing their way through a crowd that had gathered around the scene, leading to their arrests, the spokesperson said. "We will contest these charges and look forward to communicating the facts of the situation at the appropriate time," the players said in a joint statement released by the team. "We apologize to our respective families, teammates, and the Hawks' organization for any negative attention this incident has brought upon them." The Hawks are in New York for a Wednesday night game against the Brooklyn Nets. Neither player will be in uniform, the team said. Police released little information Wednesday, but local media identified the injured man as Copeland, 31, who is from Orange, New Jersey. The Pacers released a statement saying Copeland suffered a knife wound to his left elbow and abdomen, and he's in stable condition at a New York hospital. "We are aware that Chris Copeland was injured early this morning in New York City. We are still gathering information and will update when we know more. Our thoughts are with Chris and those injured," Larry Bird, the Pacers' president of basketball operations, said in a statement. Copeland's agent, John Spencer, issued a statement saying, "We're concerned about the safety of Chris and Katrine. We don't have any details at this particular time. All we can do is pray and wait." The NBA and the Hawks front office said they were looking into the incident. "We are aware of the situation involving Pero Antic and Thabo Sefolosha this morning. We are in the process of gathering more information and will have further comment at the appropriate time," Hawks spokesman Garin Narain said in an email. Copeland's Pacers are slated to play the New York Knicks on Wednesday night. The pair apparently had only recently arrived in New York prior to their arrests, as both were on the court for the Hawks' 96-69 win over the Phoenix Suns in Atlanta on Tuesday night. Antic played 12 minutes, and Sefolosha played 20. The game ended around 10 p.m. Copeland, a former Knick, was near the nightclub with Saltara when a 22-year-old Brooklyn man approached them, police told CNN affiliate WABC. There was some sort of dispute before the suspect stabbed the 6-foot-8-inch Copeland in the abdomen, slashed Saltara and then slashed another woman, the station reported. Saltara suffered cuts to her arm, breast and buttock, and the other woman suffered a slash to her stomach, CNN affiliate WCBS reported. While WCBS reported that the second woman was 53 years old, WABC reported she was 23. Images published in the New York Daily News showed a considerable amount of blood on the sidewalk and a white sports coupe, roped off with police tape, with several streaks of blood on its driver's side. Antic and Sefolosha interfered with officers trying to establish a crime scene, and one of the Hawks pushed a police officer, WABC reported. The Hawks are preparing for a historic playoff run after clinching the No. 1 seed in the NBA's Eastern Conference. Tuesday's win over the Suns marked a franchise-best 58 wins in a season for the club. The Pacers sit in the conference's 10th spot but are only one game out of playoff contention. CNN's Laura Ly, Jason Durand and Jill Martin contributed to this report.

Article: Des Moines, Iowa (CNN)Martin O'Malley told reporters in Iowa on Friday that inevitability -- a term bandied about regarding Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton -- is not unbreakable. "I've seen it before," the former Governor of Maryland and possible presidential contender said. "History is full of examples where the inevitable frontrunner was inevitable right up until she was no longer or he was no longer inevitable." Clinton was considered inevitable to win the nomination in 2008 but ended up losing to Barack Obama. O'Malley had previously dropped the inevitability comment in a television interview last month. The former governor, who capped off his two-day trip to the first-in-the-nation caucus state with a speech to the Polk County Democrats in Des Moines, said that although Clinton is an "eminently qualified candidate," the Democratic Party is full of "good leaders." "History is full of examples where people who are not very well known nationally can be very well known once they are willing to make their case to the people of Iowa," O'Malley said. In some polls, he has scored in the low single digits in the state. In a March CNN/ORC poll of national Democrats, only 1% picked O'Malley. In a January poll by Bloomberg Politics and the Des Moines Register, O'Malley was also at 1% among Iowa Democrats. Clinton, who leads most polls by upwards of 40 points, is planning to launch her presidential candidacy on Sunday through a video message on social media, a person close to her campaign-in-waiting told CNN on Friday. While he wouldn't say much about Clinton, when asked about her candidacy, O'Malley said, "if leaders believe that they have the experience and the framework to move our country forward, they should run. And they should engage with voters and our country would be the better for it." O'Malley, like other Democrats, appears to refrain from directly attacking Clinton. Although last month on ABC, he said that the presidency is "not some crown to be passed between two families," he has not focused on her. He has, however, openly teased a presidential run. "I know that, as Democrats, we expect -- and I have heard this all over the country -- the Democrats expect a robust conversation about the issues we face as a nation and the challenges we face," he said. "They believe that that conversation needs to take place in something as important as a presidential primary." He concluded: "It would be an extreme poverty indeed if there was only one person willing to compete for our party's nomination for President."

Article: (CNN)Hip-hop star Nelly has been arrested on drug charges in Tennessee after a state trooper pulled over the private bus in which he was traveling, authorities said. The 40-year-old rapper from St. Louis, who shot to fame 15 years ago with the track "Country Grammar," has been charged with felony possession of drugs, simple possession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia, the Tennessee Department of Safety and Homeland Security said. The state trooper stopped the bus carrying Nelly and five other people on Interstate 40 in Putnam County on Saturday because it wasn't displaying U.S. Department of Transportation and International Fuel Tax Association stickers, according to Tennessee authorities. The trooper was about to conduct an inspection of the bus, a Prevost motor coach, when he "noticed an odor of marijuana emitting from the vehicle," authorities said in a statement. Two troopers then searched the bus, finding "five colored crystal-type rocks that tested positive for methamphetamine, as well as a small amount of marijuana and other drug paraphernalia," the statement said. The search also turned up several handguns and 100 small Ziploc bags, which the statement said are commonly used for selling drugs. The guns included a gold-plated.50-caliber Desert Eagle pistol, a.45-caliber Taurus pistol and a.500 Smith & Wesson magnum. Nelly, whose real name is Cornell Haynes, was taken to the Putnam County Jail along with another passenger. He later posted bond and left the jail, the Putnam County Sheriff's Office said. CNN couldn't immediately reach Nelly's representatives for comment Saturday. CNN's Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this report.

Article: Celebrity chef Matt Kemp's anger management issues cost him his first marriage and his business. One of his most shameful moments was broadcast on national television when he labelled his pregnant wife a 'c***'. During an episode of SBS's Heat in the Kitchen, Kemp was so enraged he unleashed an expletive-ridden tirade on his then-wife Lela Radojkovic, who was carrying their first child, while filming at Sydney's Restaurant Balzac in 2004. Scroll down for video. The extent of Matt Kemp's rage is seen during an episode of SBS's Heat in the Kitchen, which was broadcasted in 2004. Kemp is pictured here with his fiancee, Christie Webber, who is marrying at the end of the year. The award-winning chef told Radojkovic: 'If you weren't my f***ing wife I would f***ing sack you - you c***.' Looking back, Kemp says he regrets treating his ex-wife that way. 'It really makes you feel proud of the human I was, not. You say things in the heat of the moment that you don't even think about until someone catches it on TV,' he told Daily Mail Australia. Kemp discusses his anger issues on Tuesday's episode of Insight on SBS. The chef is pictured here with three of his children. He said he missed out on a lot of their childhoods. Kemp (second from left) is pictured here with My Kitchen Rules judge Colin Fassnidge. The 44-year-old said he would work himself into a 'frenzy' because of his uncontrollable rage. 'I would be doing so many things that my head would explode - you can't clone yourself,' Kemp told Daily Mail Australia. 'I would get so angry and worked up that I couldn't speak.' It also isolated him from his kitchen staff who he said at the time he did not care about, but now he takes the time to praise them. One of his biggest regrets before he 'grew up' and became less 'hot headed' was not being there for the births of his children. 'Before I wouldn't take time off for work and if I did I would never stop thinking about it,' Kemp told Daily Mail Australia. Former NRL player Mark Geyer also had anger management issues and appears on Insight on Tuesday alongside Kemp. Geyer, who used to play for the Penrith Panthers, is pictured here with his wife, Meagan, who he describes as his rock. 'I didn't see my first two children get born. I didn't see my third child really get born. 'I've got four kids, I've got to be a dad, that sort of thing makes you grow up a bit. 'I want to be a dad. I want to spend time with them.' Kemp attributes getting older as a reason why he decided to change his attitude and behaviour about five years ago. The chef now works at Charing Cross Hotel in Waverley - in Sydney's east - and still raises his voice in the kitchen, but it does not escalate to 'uncontrollable rage'. After turning his life around, Kemp met his fiancee, Christie Webber, who he will marry at the end of the year. Another panellist on Tuesday's Insight is former NRL player Mark Geyer, 47, who got in trouble a number of times for violence after consuming alcohol. 'I got charged with assault when I was 22. I have a record for the rest of my life,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'I didn't walk away. I never started the fight in the pubs and clubs, but I finished them. 'There was a ticking bomb inside of me.' The proud father-of-five said having children was the push he needed to turn his life around. The family man has urged people to 'walk away' from a fight and not engage in fights. The proud father-of-five credits his turnaround to his children, without any help from a counsellor. He said the anger he felt before was now being re-directed to get angry at things that could hurt his children. 'The whole reason I stopped being a mug and stopped my anger was because I had children,' Geyer told Daily Mail Australia. 'I suddenly had someone to worry about instead of myself.' Geyer, who works on-air for Sydney's Triple M, told Daily Mail Australia he was 'a volcano waiting to erupt' between the ages of 17 and 26. He said the two reasons why he acted so aggressively was because he was bigger than most people and he used his size to intimidate people. Kemp and Geyer will appear on Insight's Anger episode on SBS One on Tuesday from 8.30pm. The former Penrith player said his turning point happened when his wife, Meagan, was pregnant with their first child. He said she told him to clean his act up and become the man she had married. 'I saw the ultrasound of my first baby and it made sense,' Geyer said. 'I come from a great family there was no excuse... I was becoming the opposite of what my parents wanted me to be.' Geyer urged people who had similar issues that he did to watch Insight and start to change their lives. 'I try to tell my kids, walk away,' he said. 'If you see someone in dramas always try to help, but if they're looking for trouble it's a mug's game.' Insight's Anger episode airs on Tuesday from 8.30pm on SBS One.

Article: Charleston, South Carolina (CNN)Police officers Saturday accompanied the hearse carrying the body of Walter Scott to his South Carolina funeral service, where hundreds of mourners celebrated his life and death as a catalyst for change in America. A pair of officers on motorcycles were part of the large procession delivering the father of four -- who was fatally shot in the back by a police officer -- to a service open to the public. An overflow crowd gathered on a humid and occasionally rainy April afternoon at W.O.R.D. Ministries Christian Center in Summerville, which has a capacity of about 300 people. The flag-draped casket of the U.S. Coast Guard veteran was wheeled inside the church as Scott's relatives and friends followed. Some dabbed tears; others embraced. Hundreds, including local officials, assembled inside the packed sanctuary -- in corridors, under an awning at the entrance, wherever they could stand. Silence filled the vast space as Scott's daughter Samantha read a poem of love dedicated to her father. Anthony Scott said God had selected his brother as a candidate for change in America. "The change will come," he said, bringing to the crowd to its feet. The head of the church, George Hamilton, spoke of how Scott had brought members of his family to the church, of the agony of not only losing a family member but having to watch it happen on video. The death of Scott, who was black, at the hands of a white police officer was "motivated by racial prejudice," Hamilton said. It was "an act of overt racism." "Hate came because Walter was an African-American," he said. Hamilton said his remarks were not meant as an indictment of law enforcement, but he singled out the officer who killed Scott as a "disgrace to the North Charleston Police Department." "There is gong to be change," he said. "Walter's death will not be in vain." After the service, pallbearers gently lifted Scott's casket into the hearse. Crowds poured from the church. A slow-moving procession of black cars then made its way to Live Oak Memorial Gardens in Charleston for the private burial. Chris Stewart, an attorney for the Scott family, said the death represented more than an race issue. "It's a human issue," he said. "We're getting emails from people in Arkansas telling us, 'I'm a white male, and I'm supporting this family.' Their son is going to be remembered for changing the way we look at each other." On Friday night, Scott's open casket was draped with an American flag, and he was in a dark suit for his private visitation in Charleston. A Dallas Cowboys banner -- his favorite NFL team -- was placed outside the casket, and a figurine of a Cowboys player stood at his side. But Scott's family was missing. They needed privacy, said Charleston Mayor Joseph Riley, who attended. A week ago, Scott was killed in North Charleston after getting pulled over for a broken taillight. A passer-by caught the shooting on cell phone video, and Officer Michael Slager was swiftly charged with murder. He was fired and faces life in prison or the death penalty if convicted. Who was Walter Scott? The video shows Scott running from an officer, who fires eight shots. Scott is struck five times; he falls to the ground. "Nothing in this video demonstrates that the officer's life or the life of another was threatened," National Urban League President Marc Morial said. "The question here is whether the use of force was excessive." But one witness is speaking of a struggle before the shooting. And at least one expert believes a murder charge may not hold up. On Thursday, Gwen Nichols told CNN's Brian Todd that she saw Scott and Slager scuffling at the entrance to a vacant lot. "It was like a tussle type of thing, like, you know, like, 'What do you want?' or 'What did I do?' type of thing," Nichols said. "I didn't hear Mr. Slager saying 'Stop!' " Nichols' account has similarities to Slager's. He had told investigators that he had tussled with Scott over his Taser and that he feared for his safety. A timeline of events. Criminal defense attorney Paul Callan said he believes Slager's defense will play up the reported scuffle in arguing that this is not a murder case. "Defense attorneys will say this was a heat of passion shooting -- (that) this was something that he did suddenly after some kind of an altercation, a physical altercation with a suspect," Callan said. "And that would constitute manslaughter under law, as opposed to murder, and it makes a huge difference in sentencing." In South Carolina, a murder conviction requires a measure of premeditation. But the account from the witness who recorded the cell phone video, Feidin Santana, paints a different picture. He was walking to work when he saw Slager on top of Scott, he said, who was on the ground. Santana said he could hear the sound of a Taser in use. He said he didn't see Scott go after the Taser, as Slager initially claimed. He said he believes Scott was trying to get away. "Mr. Scott never tried to fight," Santana said. Neither the struggle nor the use of a Taser was captured on video, because Santana started recording shortly after that. Investigators from the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division found troubling inconsistencies from the very start, it said in a statement. "We believed early on that there was something not right about what happened in that encounter," division Chief Mark Keel said in a statement. "The cell phone video shot by a bystander confirmed our initial suspicions." Slager's lawyer, Andy Savage, has complained that he "has not received the cooperation from law enforcement that the media has." Savage's office said in a statement that it has yet to receive "any investigative documents, audio or video tapes, other than a copy of Mr. Slager's arrest warrant." The news release added that the lawyer has been advised that the police union that Slager belongs to "is no longer involved in the case." Charleston County Sheriff Al Cannon said Slager's wife, Jamie, who is eight months' pregnant, and his mother had a visit with him at the county detention center Friday.  Slager was being held in isolation and being "monitored for his mental health," Cannon said. In a statement, one of Slager's lawyers said the meeting lasted about an hour. "His wife and mom were tearful but strong, and they were all very grateful for the chance to see him in person, even if separated by a thick pane of glass," the statement said. "They held up family photos -- and even Jamie's ultrasound from earlier that day -- to remind him of all those who love him. Throughout the visit, Michael was focused on Jamie and their baby and was very relieved to know that she is being shown so much love and support by their families." A second video, taken from a police dash cam, has also emerged from the day Scott died. It shows moments before  the shooting, when things seemed to be going smoothly between Scott and Slager. Scott apparently tells the officer that he has no insurance on the vehicle, and Slager returns to his car to do paperwork. Then Scott gets out of the car and runs out of the camera's frame. Scott was the subject of a bench warrant over $18,104.43 in unpaid child support at the time of the stop, according to court records. That was why he ran, lawyers for the family said after the funeral service. U.S. Rep. James Clyburn, D-South Carolina, told reporters outside the service that Scott lost a $35,000-a-year job the first time he was jailed for failing to pay child support. "He said it was the best job he's ever had," Clyburn said. "Now you have to ask... if you want to collect child support, there's got to be income. And you ain't going to make much income from jail. It seems to me that we need to take a look to how to deal with that issue without causing unemployment and the loss of freedom." On Friday afternoon, police met with a man who was in Scott's car, but the passenger's name wasn't in a police report obtained by CNN. He was detained briefly after the shooting, one officer wrote in the report. Scott family attorney Chris Stewart said he was a co-worker and friend. But he did not identify the passenger by name. On Friday, a few mourners trickled into the Fielding Home for Funerals. A white banner with a blue star near Scott's casket displayed his favorite NFL team. It said: "Tradition, the Cowboys way." "This is a heartbreaking tragedy for everyone in our community," said Riley, the mayor. "It breaks everyone's hearts." CNN's Polo Sandoval and Martin Savidge reported from Charleston, and Ben Brumfield and Ray Sanchez reported and wrote in Atlanta and New York.

Article: Roberto Martinez will hold talks with Kevin Mirallas over his future at the end of the season as he stated his ambition to keep Aaron Lennon. Mirallas was one of Everton’s top performers in the first half of the campaign but his form has tailed off following a number of hamstring injuries and he has wanted by Tottenham during the January transfer window. It was mooted at one point that Mirallas and Lennon could be part of a swap deal but Lennon arrived at Goodison Park on loan and has made a big impression on his manager; it would cost £6million to make his signing permanent when the window re-opens. Roberto Martinez will hold talks with Kevin Mirallas and admits he wants to keep loanee Aaron Lenon. Mirallas has made no secret of his ambition to play in the Champions League and Martinez, whose side face Swansea on Saturday, will speak to him after the final game about what his intentions are moving forward. ‘Every player needs to be pleased and happy with that, so in the summer we'll sit down and assess what has been,’ said Martinez. ‘For that reason the next seven games are vital and will give you a much clearer picture of what you do in the summer. Belgian attacker Mirallas was one of Everton’s top performers in the first half of the campaign. ‘I know there have been a couple of times he's had quotes translated from interviews. I don't think anything he has said is disrespectful or out of the norm. The way I see it he's one of those players who loves playing football and he hasn't got any other motivation. ‘He still has a two year contract. If he were out of contract, I would be worried, but all I want is for him to be fully recovered.’ Mirallas has made no secret of his ambition to play in the Champions League. Lennon has caught the eye in recent weeks and Martinez wants him to maintain his impressive form all the way through until the end of May. ‘He’s been a really impressive footballer,’ said Martinez. ‘The way he’s engaged with the other players has been quite impressive. I think he’s brought know-how and experience but also that freshness of wanting to show what he can do. ‘The next seven games will be very important to see if he can carry on enjoying his football and then like any loan situation it’s a three way conversation that, first of all, the player needs to see that experience as a positive one and then we’ll see what the parent club wants to do. ‘But it’s not a decision we need to make now. The next seven games is an eternity in football.’ Lennon is all smiles as Everton train ahead of their weekend fixture against Swansea City. Lennon is challenged Victor Wanyama during the Premier League match between Everton and Southampton.

Article: (CNN)For 12 years Adelma Cifuentes felt worthless, frightened and alone, never knowing when her abusive husband would strike. But as a young mother in rural Guatemala with three children and barely a third grade education, she thought there was no way out. What began as psychological torment, name-calling and humiliation turned into beatings so severe Cifuentes feared for her life. One day, two men sent by her husband showed up at her house armed with a shotgun and orders to kill her. They probably would have succeeded, but after the first bullet was fired, Cifuentes' two sons dragged her inside. Still, in her deeply conservative community, it took neighbors two hours to call for help and Cifuentes lost her arm. But the abuse didn't stop there. When she returned home, Cifuentes' husband continued his attacks and threatened to rape their little girl unless she left. That's when the nightmare finally ended and her search for justice began. Cifuentes' case is dramatic, but in Guatemala, where nearly 10 out of every 100,000 women are killed, it's hardly unusual. A 2012 Small Arms Survey says gender-based violence is at epidemic levels in Guatemala and the country ranks third in the killings of women worldwide. According to the United Nations, two women are killed there every day. There are many reasons why, beginning with the legacy of violence left in place after the country's 36-year-old civil war. During the conflict, atrocities were committed against women, who were used as a weapon of war. In 1996, a ceasefire agreement was reached between insurgents and the government. But what followed and what remains is a climate of terror, due to a deeply entrenched culture of impunity and discrimination. Military and paramilitary groups that committed barbaric acts during the war were integrated back into society without any repercussions. Many remain in power, and they have not changed the way they view women. Some 200,000 people were either killed or disappeared during the decades-long conflict, most of them from indigenous Mayan populations. Nearly 20 years later, according to the Security Sector Reform Resource Centre, levels of violent crime are  higher in Guatemala than they were during the war. But despite the high homicide rate, the United Nations estimates 98% of cases never make it to court. Women are particularly vulnerable because of a deep-rooted gender bias and culture of misogyny. In many cases, femicide -- the killing of a woman simply because of her gender -- is carried out with shocking brutality with some of the same strategies used during the war, including rape, torture and mutilation. Mexican drug cartels, organized criminal groups and local gangs are contributing to the vicious cycle of violence and lawlessness.  Authorities investigating drug-related killings are stretched thin, leaving fewer resources to investigate femicides. In many cases, crime is not reported because of fear of retaliation. Many consider the Guatamalen National Civil Police, or PNC, corrupt, under-resourced and ineffective. Even if a case does get prosecuted, according to Human Rights Watch, the country's weak judicial system has proved incapable of handling the explosion in violence. Perhaps one of the biggest challenges facing women in Guatemala is the country's deeply rooted patriarchal society. According to María Machicado Terán, the representative of U.N. women in Guatemala, "80% of men believe that women need permission to leave the house, and 70% of women surveyed agreed." This prevailing culture of machismo and an institutionalized acceptance of brutality against women leads to high rates of violence. Rights groups say machismo not only condones violence, it places the blame on the victim. The political will to address violence against women is slow to materialize. "Politicians don't think women are important," says former Secretary General of the Presidential Secretariat for Women Elizabeth Quiroa. "Political parties use women for elections. They give them a bag of food and people sell their dignity for this because they are poor." Lack of education is a major contributor to this poverty. Many girls, especially in indigenous communities don't go to school because the distance from their house to the classroom is too far. Quiroa says "They are subject to rape, violence and forced participation in the drug trade." Although the situation for girls and women in Guatemala is alarming, there are signs the culture of discrimination may be slowly changing.  With the help of an organization known as CICAM, or Centro de Investigación, Cifuentes was finally able to escape her  husband and get the justice she deserved. He is now spending 27 years behind bars. Cifuentes is using her painful past to provide hope and healing to others through art. Since 2008, she and four other abuse survivors known as La Poderosas, or "The Powerful," have been appearing in a play based on their real life stories. The show not only empowers other women and discusses the problem of violence openly, but it also offers suggestions for change. And it's having an impact. Women have started breaking their silence and asking where they can get support. Men are reacting, too. One of the main characters, Lesbia Téllez, says  during one presentation, a man stood up and started crying when he realized how he had treated his wife and how his mother had been treated. He said he wanted to be different. The taboo topic of gender-based violence is also being acknowledged and recognized in a popular program targeting one of Guatemala's most vulnerable groups, indigenous Mayan girls.  In 2004, with help from the United Nations and other organizations, the Population Council launched a community-based club known as Abriendo Oportunidades, or "Opening Opportunities". The goal is to provide girls with a safe place to learn about their rights and reach their full potential. Senior Program Coordinator Alejandra Colom says the issue of violence is discussed and girls are taught how to protect themselves. "They then share this information with their mothers and for the first time, they realize they are entitled to certain rights." Colom adds that mothers then become invested in sending their daughters to the clubs and this keeps them more visible and less prone to violence. The Guatemalan government is also moving in the right direction to address the problem of violence against women. In 2008, the Congress passed a law against femicide. Two years later the attorney general's office created a specialized court to try femicides and other violent crimes against women. In 2012, the government established a joint task force for crimes against women, making it easier for women to access justice by making sure victims receive the assistance they need. The government has also established a special 24-hour court to attend to femicide cases. On the global front, the International Violence Against Women Act was introduced in the U.S. Congress in 2007; it has been pending ever since. But last week the act was reintroduced in both the House and Senate. If approved, it would make reducing levels of gender-based violence a U.S. foreign policy priority. Pehaps the most immediate and effective help is coming from International nongovernmental organizations, which are on the front lines of the fight against gender-based discrimination in Guatemala. Ben Weingrod, a senior policy advocate at the global poverty fighting group CARE, says, "We work to identify and challenge harmful social norms that perpetuate violence.  Our work includes engaging men and boys as champions of change and role models, and facilitating debates to change harmful norms and create space for more equitable relationships between men and women." But the job is far from over. While there is tempered optimism and hope for change, the problem of gender-based violence in Guatemala is one that needs international attention and immediate action. Cifuentes is finding strength through the theater and the support of other abuse survivors, which has allowed her to move forward. But millions of other women trapped in a cycle of violence are facing dangerous and frightening futures. For them, it's a race against time and help cannot come soon enough.

Article: (CNN)Hillary Clinton is finally announcing her candidacy for the 2016 presidential election. Although she has watched her standing in the polls sag in recent months, there is likely to be a boost in the days that follow the announcement. For Democrats, there is ample reason to be excited about Clinton's run for the presidency. She is certainly one of the strongest candidates in many decades. She brings to the table extensive political and policy experience, a combination of skills that is often lacking. She has been through some of the roughest partisan wars and emerged stronger than ever before. She has a keen sense about the nature of the modern news media, how to use it to her advantage and how to survive scandal frenzies. She is a hardened, tough partisan who will not shy away from Republican attack. Americans have many positive memories of Clinton name, given the booming economy of the late 1990s during Bill Clinton's presidency. If Hillary Clinton puts together an effective campaign, she could be unbeatable in the Democratic primaries as well as in the general election. However, during the buildup to her final decision, some of her weaknesses have also been exposed. Clinton doesn't want to end up like Vice President Al Gore in 2000. Although he did relatively well in the final election (with many Americans believing that he did actually defeat George W. Bush) he didn't generate much energy once the campaign started. Although he too was touted as a "perfect" candidate who was the ideal person for the job, something seemed stiff and inauthentic when he actually hit the trail. He seemed to freeze when the television cameras were rolling. Gore had trouble connecting with voters, and he seemed to remake his image constantly. His biggest asset ended up being that he was viewed as the inevitable nominee, rather than what he actually stood for. Clinton must avoid following Gore's path. She suffered this fate in the 2008 primaries and can't afford to do so again. She needs to do more than rest on the perception that her candidacy is inevitable and on her record of experience. That is not enough. More important is for her to put forth an exciting vision about what she would stand for in the White House. Voters thirst for signs of greatness when they pick their presidents, even if they are savvy enough to understand that the reality of a polarized Washington will probably limit her ability to achieve bold change. A recent story in The Washington Post suggests that her advisers are aware of this potential liability. After the announcement, they are going to avoid big rallies and events and instead concentrate on smaller events where she will meet with voters directly in states such as Iowa and New Hampshire. Clinton also will have to contend with doubts about her authenticity. In his first day on the campaign trail, Sen. Rand Paul immediately tapped into these concerns by raising questions about whether she could be trusted. That question has dogged the Clintons ever since they came onto the national political scene in the late 1980s. Their greatest virtue, their immense skills as politicians, has often come back to haunt them. Bill Clinton was attacked as "slick Willie" by members of both parties for the perception that he would say anything to win and Hillary Clinton has faced similar criticism. When she tried to distance herself from her vote for the use of force in Iraq, many Democrats didn't buy her critique of President George W. Bush's foreign policies and went for Barack Obama instead. When she conducted her "listening tour" of New York before running for the Senate, many voters saw it as a manufactured effort to hide the fact she was running for office as an outsider. When she explained that there was nothing to the recent stories about her use of a private email server rather than her State Department email, some felt that even if the story was relatively minor it indicated that she wasn't always telling us what she was really about. Even if she isn't hiding anything, she often gives that appearance. During the next few months, Clinton will also have to connect with her party's base. The ongoing speculation about Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has suggested that the most active part of the Democratic Party is not that enthused with Clinton's candidacy. While they will probably vote for her, they are not very motivated and don't trust that she will stand for Democratic values. She will need to address these concerns, not through her style but through her agenda. Voters will want to hear her talking about issues such as tougher financial regulation and policies to diminish economic inequality as well as her positions on race and policing. She will also need to make clear that she has heard voters on being too hawkish about going to war and give clear indications about how she would handle a nuclear agreement with Iran. Clinton will also have to contend with the gender bias that still exists in the electorate at large. Without any doubt she will be subject to questions and comments -- about her appearance, for instance -- that won't be aimed at male candidates. Part of her candidacy is itself an effort to break down these remaining vestiges of political sexism. But the struggle will be tough. Finally, and this relates to the last challenge, Clinton will have to contend with her husband. To be sure he can be an immense force on the campaign trail, one of the most compelling Democrats of our generation. But he can also be liability. As she learned in 2008, Bill Clinton is not always easy to control. When he speaks his mind, as he did in dismissive comments about Obama's candidacy, it can often work against her. The fund-raising records of the Clinton Foundation will also raise questions about conflict of interest, and ongoing stories about his personal life, as was the case when Monica Lewinsky returned to the media a few months ago, could re-emerge on the campaign trail. Whether that is fair or not is beside the point: Everything is fair game on the modern campaign trail. Hillary Clinton has the potential to be a hugely successful presidential candidate. But she and her campaign team will need to address the multiple questions and weaknesses that have become clear in recent months.

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence. Hillary Clinton has announced her candidacy for the 2016 presidential election, and while she has extensive political and policy experience, she must avoid coming across as stiff and inauthentic like Al Gore in 2000 and address

Article: England's premier bowler Jimmy Anderson suffered a frustrating day in his bid to become his country's all-time leading wicket taker in his 100th Test appearance in Antigua. But pace attack colleague Chris Jordan believes the Anderson family celebration party is 'just around the corner' as West Indies fell to 155 for four in response to England's first-innings total of 399. Anderson, watched by his parents, wife, two daughters and agent and needing four wickets to overtake the great Sir Ian Botham's haul of 383, claimed only one early victim in West Indies opener Devon Smith in his 13 overs, which went for 24 runs and eight maidens. Jimmy Anderson moved to within two wickets of Sir Ian Botham's record of 383 Test wickets. Anderson could only take the one wicket on day two of the first Test in Antigua. But even the England back-room staff were surprised that Anderson bowled just four overs in the last session of play with team-mates Jordan, Stuart Broad and James Tredwell sharing the other wickets to fall. It could have been better but a Ben Stokes wicket was ruled a no ball. Jordan took a stunning slip catch off Tredwell to dismiss West Indies vice-captain Kraigg Brathwaite, who claimed after play that he thought Anderson'looked tired'. But Jordan said: 'Jimmy got us off and running with the first wicket and the rest of us tried to back that up, which I thought we did pretty well. If he keeps doing that and bowling the way he does those wickets are just around the corner. Chris Jordan jumps for joy after taking the wicket of Darren Bravo on the second afternoon. Jordan appeals for an lbw against West Indian batsman Kraigg Brathwaite, but it was unsuccessful. 'The stat is obviously there but I don't think Jimmy or any of us are going about our cricket or thinking about things differently. 'We're just trying to group balls as a bowling unit and create pressure. 'As a group we try and win every session, so we'll come back as hard as we can to break this partnership then make inroads into the tail.' Ironically, No 11 Anderson and Jordan were the pick of the lower-order England batsman in a last-wicket partnership of 38 as the West Indies bowling attack, inspired by a talk from bowling coach Sir Curtly Ambrose, captured the last five wickets for 58. West Indies opener Brathwaite did a good job of seeing off Anderson in a challenging first spell and though he eventually fell for 39, he enjoyed the test. Jordan later took a stunning catch at first slip off Tredwell's bowling to dismiss Brathwaite. 'Obviously when Anderson started with the new ball it was moving a lot, so facing him then was a little more challenging. 'But obviously he bowled a couple of overs before lunch as well so I don't know if maybe he was a little bit tired. 'It was a good challenge facing him when the ball is swinging both ways. The key is to keep as still as possible.' Brathwaite's knock would probably have lasted longer had anyone other than the athletic Jordan been stationed at slip, where he claimed a superb one-handed catch inches off the ground. Jordan is, of course, Barbados born - a fact not lost on Brathwaite. 'It was CJ who caught me, a fella from here, so it was quite unlucky.' About his catch, Jordan said:'It was a reaction one but it rivals my best at this level.'

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence.
Jimmy Anderson claimed his 381st Test wicket on Tuesday in Antigua. The 32-year-old dismissed Devon Smith for 10 on day two of first Test. Anderson is still two wickets behind Sir Ian Botham's record of 383. Chris Jordan says that the record is 'just around the corner'

Article: (CNN)A year after its Cannes debut and finally seeing a theatrical release, "Lost River" is still causing quite a stir. Booed at its premiere and mocked by reviewers, Ryan Gosling's first feature as director has been divisive, to put it mildly. But there has been one shining light cutting through the fog of critical hyperbole: its setting, a besmirched and decaying Detroit. Wavering on the brink of annihilation, yet providing kindling for its own rebirth, the city is captured in all its waning splendor, the perfect backdrop for Gosling's post-industrial gothic. Speaking about the film in London, Gosling made clear that the city was at the heart of the project -- in fact, without Detroit's crumbling edifices there would be no film at all. Gosling said that "Lost River" began as a collection of speculative shots of the Brewster-Douglass Projects, the first black social housing development in America and a place Motown legends The Supremes and boxer Joe Louis once called home. "I heard [the authorities] were going to tear them down," Gosling said. "I had to shoot them before they did." Taking time out between acting jobs, he ventured into the projects. "I started shooting more and more," he explained, "and then I realized that I was making a film. Then I started writing [the script] during the process of filming." Gosling's affection for the Motor City is longstanding, the actor growing up "not too far away" in Cornwall, Ontario. "It seemed like everything cool came from Detroit... the whole American Dream," he reminisces. "The Model-T, Motown, the refrigerator..." Now though he references "40 miles of dead neighborhoods," the city declaring bankruptcy. "Houses are burning and things are being torn down," he says, "and within that there are families trying to hold on to their homes. For them it has become a nightmare and I wanted to make a film about that." The title itself alludes to a once thriving community now displaced, its homes at the bottom of a reservoir built with little concern for the residents -- man-made interference with untold social repercussions. Speaking in broader terms, Gosling argues "there are Lost Rivers everywhere and we wanted to share the experience these people were having." On screen he paints a nihilistic image of wanton destruction; torched properties and bulldozers jostling for our attention amid acts of extreme human violence -- sometimes self-inflicted. The director plainly states that as a location it "was pretty dangerous." He describes "an energy there that was threatening... We had a very charmed experience [filming]. It worked its way into the fabric of the movie --- a tone of impending threat that was just there." However there are signs of humanity and regeneration amongst the chaos, on camera and off. For the film's young protagonist, every raid on an unoccupied house offers copper piping waiting to be recast and ultimately reclaimed. Similarly, Gosling references the Heidelberg Project during the discussion, a community organization in the city's McDougall-Hunt neighborhood, reimagining derelict buildings as giant canvases for budding artists. He recalls seeing "one house covered with teddy bears, another covered in clocks... people taking spaces and personalizing them." The city's scope for urban renewal was clearly a draw. "Something really interesting is happening in Detroit at the moment -- a rebirth. People redefining what they are," according to Gosling. "There's a resilience there and an energy, and it's exciting." As much as the visual content of "Lost River" revolves around a maudlin preoccupation with dereliction -- and perhaps plays on the outside world's perception of Detroit -- aspects of the narrative suggest hope and the possibility of reincarnation for the city. Gosling claims this paradox should exist when discussing Detroit, and is precisely what the film is trying to convey. "We want people to know that dereliction is happening there, but that it's not only what is happening there," he argues. "It doesn't define Detroit, it's just part of what it's dealing with right now." "Lost River" receives a limited theatrical release in the U.S. and UK on April 10.

Article: Chelsea will try to add another trophy to their ever-expanding cabinet when the Under 19 team take on Shakhtar Donetsk in the final of the UEFA Youth League on Monday afternoon. Adi Viveash's team will start as favourites in Nyon, Switzerland after their resounding 4-0 win over Roma in the semi-finals on Friday, a result which continued their free-scoring form in this competition. Ahead of the final, we bring you everything you need to know. Chelsea striker Dominic Solanke starred in his side's emphatic 4-0 semi-final win over Roma on Friday. Solanke has scored 11 UEFA Youth League games during Chelsea's route to the final in Nyon, Switzerland. REMIND ME, WHAT IS THE UEFA YOUTH LEAGUE? In a nutshell, it's the Champions League - but for Under 19 teams. In its second season, the Youth League was created by UEFA to enable up-and-coming players in Europe's leading academies to gain valuable experience of playing in continental competition. The group phase runs in parallel with its big brother, with the same 32 teams as in the Champions League matched in the same groups. The main difference is that the knockout rounds are single-legged and the semi-finals and final in the same place over the course of one weekend. SO, WHERE IS THAT? Monday's final will be played at the Stade Colovray, which is situated in the shadow of UEFA's headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland. It's a pleasant spot, overlooking Lake Geneva, and is the home of Stade Nyonnais, who play in the Swiss third tier. It's capacity is 7,200 and pretty big crowds were there enjoying the sunshine and the football in Friday's semi-finals. WHEN IS THE GAME AND CAN I WATCH IT? It will kick-off at 3pm UK time and the match is live on British Eurosport. WHO WON THE COMPETITION LAST YEAR? The maiden winners of the Youth League were Barcelona, who defeated Benfica 3-0 in a one-sided final. The goals came from Rodrigo and a double from Munir El Haddadi, the competition's top goalscorer with 11 and now a member of the first-team squad. There was no English representation in the last four, though both Chelsea and Manchester City had made it to the quarter-finals. HOW HAVE THE BRITISH CLUBS DONE THIS YEAR? Chelsea, obviously, have made it all the way. Manchester City went out to Roma in the last eight, while both Arsenal and Liverpool tumbled out at the last 16 stage. Arsenal lost 1-0 to Atletico Madrid and Liverpool were beaten 2-1 by Benfica. ALL HOPES WITH CHELSEA THEN? Yes, and they will enter Monday's match as the marginal favourites. It is well-established that the Stamford Bridge academy is one of the best in England and last season saw the Under 21 team claim the Premier League title and the Under 18s win the FA Youth Cup. They will take on Manchester City in this season's Youth Cup final, too, over the next couple of weeks, their fifth final in six seasons. Having missed out on the NextGen Series title to Aston Villa two years ago, this is an excellent opportunity to assert their claim as one of Europe's best academies too. Chelsea's Isaiah Brown (left) tussle for the ball with Roma's Silvio Anocic (right) in the box. WHO HAVE THEY BEATEN TO GET THIS FAR? The Blues made a statement of intent in the group phase, winning five of their six matches and racking up 24 goals in the process. Slovenians Maribor were beaten 2-0 at home and 7-0 away, while Sporting Lisbon suffered 5-0 and 6-0 drubbings. Germans Schalke, who knocked Chelsea out last season, were beaten 4-1 before managing to win 2-0 at home. Chelsea then overcame Russians Zenit St Petersburg 3-1 in the last 16 courtesy of goals from Dominic Solanke, Kasey Palmer and Charlie Colkett. Atletico Madrid were then seen off 2-0 at Cobham in the quarters, with an own goal and another from Solanke securing their passage to Switzerland. But their most impressive performance came in the semi-final with Roma on Friday as a flurry of second-half goals from Colkett, Solanke (2) and Tammy Abraham left Roma in ruins. Chelsea's Ruben Loftus-Cheek (right) and Roma's Jose Machin (left) battle for the ball on Monday. WHAT ARE THEY SAYING? Coach Viveash was effusive about his team's qualities after their drubbing of Roma, telling Uefa.com: 'I'm very proud – proud of the players, proud of the staff who have worked very hard to get to this stage. When you see players perform like that it brings warmth to your heart. 'I feel very proud to work with that calibre of player and to watch them play is wonderful for everyone who works in our academy. They were excellent from minute one to minute 94 and thoroughly deserve their place in the final.' Tournament top scorer Solanke, who took his season's tally to 11 Youth League goals with a brace, added: 'I'm over the moon. We had quite a difficult journey yesterday because our flight was cancelled, so we had to get on with it today. It's amazing to reach the final. 'It's such a big tournament containing some of the best teams in the world. The level has gone up in the knockout games, but we've stepped things up as well and managed to reach the final.' WHO IS THE COACH? Adi Viveash is a former defender who played for Swindon Town, Walsall and Reading in the Football League during an 18-year playing career. He joined Chelsea's academy in 2008, starting with the Under 12 team and working his way up. In July 2011, he was appointed Under 18 coach and led the team to two FA Youth Cup triumphs in three seasons. Viveash stepped up to take charge of the under 21 team this season and doubles up to lead the under 19 side in the Youth League. MEET THE PLAYERS.

Article: The huge build-up to England women's Under 19 replay against Norway was truly bizarre and unprecedented. And it was a game only supposed to last for 18 seconds. Leah Williamson held incredible nerve to retake a penalty which she ought to have taken on Saturday, were it not for German referee Marjia Kurtes' terrific blunder. Kurtes disallowed Williamson's penalty for encroachment from England players at the weekend, but instead of ordering her back to the spot, awarded a free-kick to Norway. Leah Williamson (centre) stepped up again to take the penalty during the 18-second rematch against Norway. Williamson went the same way as her successful spot-kick last Saturday and found the net once again. Norwegian goalkeeper Oda Marie Hove Bogstad was unable to stop Williamson's brilliant effort. The England captain wheels away in celebration after handing her side a crucial 2-2 draw. But England were given a lifeline when UEFA chiefs ruled it should be replayed. All match details from Saturday, including the time of day the penalty was awarded, the venue, the players who were on the pitch, were ticked off by the Swiss blazers and the game was restarted at 9.45pm. And that was a whole FIVE hours after both had played their final Elite Round games in Northern Ireland. Only Kurtes was replaced, by referee Kateryna Zora. It began in what would have been the 96th minute, and ended 65 seconds later. Leah said: 'They were the longest 24 hours of my life, I hadn't slept. I think I was just excited, I went through so many emotions and just felt excitement, so I thought 'yep, that's how I am going to feel'! 'We had a conversation just before I came out which was quite emotional, we have been through a bigger journey than some people go through in their whole careers because of what happened, it was never about me, it was about the team. The England players celebrate Williamson's penalty which earned them a 2-2 draw in Belfast. England held on in the final moments to secure the draw and, with it, a place in this summer's finals in Israel. Williamson blows a kiss to the crowd as Mo Marley's side look ahead to this summer's tournament. Number of seconds played: 65.18 after the players returned to the centre circle. Number of England players on the pitch: Norway were already down to 10 outfield players, but England brought on a sub to replace one injured in the game vs Switzerland. Days between spot-kicks: Five days between Saturday's clash and the controversial rematch. Number of goals scored: 1 - the infamous penalty. 'When something is taken away from you like that, you realise just how much you want it, and that's what happened. Qualifying is such a huge deal for us, it's massive.' Norway discovered minutes before the penalty was retaken they would qualify for the July finals in Israel, as best runners-up across all Elite Round groups. Had the penalty been missed, Norway would have finished table-toppers, and the Dutch would have progressed as best second-placed team. It was the most surreal football you could imagine, starting from the penalty spot, with none of the regular pomp of a competitive international, yet much more attention than a girls' game normally yields. Under-age women's games in Northern Ireland, if the passionate hosts aren't playing, are usually lucky to attract treble figures. England are awarded a penalty during their European U19 Women's Championships qualifier on Saturday. Referee Marija Kurtes points to the spot as England are awarded a penalty in the 96th minute. Williamson steps up to take a penalty in the closing stages of the match against Norway in Belfast. Williamson runs forward to strike the ball but team-mate Rosella Ayane (circled) has entered the box. Williamson turns and celebrates as she slots the ball into the goalkeeper's bottom-right corner. German referee Marija Kurtes officiating a women's Bundesliga match in Munich last month. England players celebrate after they thought they had equalised against Norway. But referee Kurtes awards an indirect free-kick and the celebrations are cut short. Williamson has the ball back in her hands ready for what she thought would be a retake. While the disgraced Kurtes, who was sent home after her blunder, will be keen to shelve her nightmare, Williamson's name will crop up in pub quizzes for generations. England coach Mo Marley said: 'Obviously the tournament has been tough and pretty much it's about following through in the right way. We are happy we gave ourselves a chance to qualify and everything has turned out the way we wanted it, for Norway as well. 'I know how hard these players have worked, credit to all of the other teams, and credit to Norway, we deserve to be in the finals. 'It's ironic because a lot of the hard work we did at the start of the week was about a long journey, handling the intense pressure of a tournament and tests to our resolve, which helped a lot. But Williamson then realises the referee's decision and two Norwegian players are seen celebrating. German referee Kurtes is understood to have been sent home following her error on Saturday. 'Everyone was aware of the possible outcomes, we may not have scored the penalty, we know that. 'We may not have got through. But we are just so tremendously happy.' Since this odd chain of events stemmed from an infringement of the game's laws, UEFA's disciplinary committee did exactly the right thing in instructing for it to be replayed. But it sets a dangerous precedent. England's appeal cost just £750, which is repayable to the FA as it was successful, but was it lodged just because it's arguably a lower level of football? It triggers questions concerning how many more appeals of this nature could happen in the future. In a men's senior England international, one presumes one of the tens of thousands of people would correct the referee, whereas perhaps the same can't be guaranteed with a three-figure crowd. Indeed, would you have that inexcusable refereeing in the first place? September 2005 - World Cup qualifier - Uzbekistan vs Bahrain. Uzbekistan had won the opening leg of the Asian zone fourth-round play-off 1-0 at home but were left incensed after a penalty was disallowed in the 38th minute for an attacking player encroaching. Rather than retaking the penalty, an indirect free-kick was wrongly awarded by Japanese referee Toshimitsu Yoshida to Bahrain and the game ended with a one-goal margin. Uzbekistan called for an investigation but were left furious after FIFA ordered the match to be replayed in its entirety with the result declared invalid. It proved to have a major impact as it was Bahrain who eventually went through with a 1-1 away goals victory, though they were later beaten in the AFC-CONCACAF play-off. Bahrain staff and players celebrate after beating Uzbekistan in an Asian World Cup qualifier in 2005.

Article: (CNN)All Elizabeth Sedway wanted was to leave paradise and head home. But she couldn't. Why? Because, according to her, she has cancer. That's what she said in a video posted to Facebook that shows her group packing up from their Alaska Airlines plane as it sat at the gate in Hawaii. "You're taking me off the airplane because I don't have a doctor's note saying I can fly," a woman is heard saying. "All these people are waiting, and I'm being removed as if  I'm a criminal or contagious, because I have cancer and no note to fly." Sedway did eventually get on a flight back to San Jose, California, although she didn't get home until late Tuesday night. And she got an apology. "We regret the inconvenience Ms. Sedway experienced... and are very sorry for how the situation was handled," Alaska Airlines spokeswoman Bobbie Egan said. "... While our employee had the customer's well-being in mind, the situation could have been handled differently." Her cancer fight notwithstanding, Sedway was in Hawaii in time to celebrate her 14th wedding anniversary. Still, on Monday, she was on a plane to head east. Then, according to her Facebook post, an airline employee who saw Sedway seated in the handicapped section asked her how she was doing. The second time she inquired, Sedway wrote that she responded by saying she sometimes felt weak. That was followed by a call to a doctor, then her removal from the plane. Egan, the Alaska Airlines spokeswoman, acknowledged that the carrier's policy when someone has a medical issue is to call MedLink, a group of ER nurses and doctors. The idea, she explained, is that "it is better to address medical issues or concerns on the ground rather than in the air, especially on flights to or from Hawaii" -- which in that case would last five-plus hours over open ocean. The decision to pull Sedway from the flight was done with "the customer's well-being" in mind, according to Egan. Still, that doesn't mean it was the right decision. Alaska Airlines since apologized to Sedway "for the disruption this has caused," in addition to refunding her family's tickets and paying for their overnight accommodations." Even though she was stuck in Hawaii, Sedway made clear on Facebook that this was a real "disruption." "Because of this, I will miss my chemotherapy, my children will miss school and my husband will miss important meetings," she said.

In the rear view mirror I could see absolute carnage. 'A car swerved out of the way and went completely into the barrier and the next car did the same. About four cars must have crashed before she finally stopped. 'It was just chaos and it was shocking to see all these cars swerving out of control. It was surreal and if I hadn't changed lanes a few seconds earlier it could have been much worse for us.'

Article: (CNN)There was a larger message in the article about a purported gang rape that Rolling Stone retracted on Sunday night -- a part of the story that was never disputed: The University of Virginia is under continuing investigation over how it handles sexual assault on campus. The school has never expelled a single student for sexual assault -- even when the student admitted to it. The Virginia attorney general asked the law firm of O'Melveny & Myers to take a look at how the university historically handled allegations of sexual assault by its students. That includes how UVA officials handled the allegations in the discredited Rolling Stone article by a student the magazine called "Jackie," especially since the school knew about the allegations for more than a year before the article came out. The alleged gang rape at a fraternity house was in 2012, and Jackie told the university about it the next spring. She started telling her story very publicly, including at a "take back the night" rally. But Charlottesville police didn't hear about it until after a separate incident in the spring of 2014, in which Jackie claimed someone threw a bottle that hit her in the face. When a university dean arranged for her to talk to police about that alleged assault, she also told the story of the alleged 2012 incident. In both cases, police said Jackie refused to cooperate and so they could not pursue the case. But more women came forward to talk about their experiences -- women whose stories were not as dramatic or horrific as Jackie's. Rolling Stone's story opened up a conversation about the topic, and then women began coming forward to talk about a culture on campus that was not sensitive to victims. Many women told CNN about a euphemism for the word rape used by other students on campus. They'd call it a "bad experience." Others told CNN that there were fraternities with reputations for being "rapey" and for using date-rape drugs. That some judged who could come in based on the sluttiness of a woman's outfit. And if a woman did report her rape, some women complained that the internal process didn't seem worth it if their abuser wouldn't be kicked out of school. Rolling Stone had a line in its original story: "UVA's emphasis on honor is so pronounced that since 1998, 183 people have been expelled for honor-code violations such as cheating on exams. And yet paradoxically, not a single student at UVA has ever been expelled for sexual assault." After the article published, UVA admitted this and instituted a zero-tolerance policy on sexual assault going forward -- although that policy was never defined, so it's unclear what it means. When the story was deleted from Rolling Stone's website, that was lost. "You lose a lot of other people's voices who were in that article," said Sarah Roderick, a survivor and UVA student, "and a lot of good things that could have come about. Fixing problems with administration here and on our campus" -- and, she added, across the nationo. Along with the O'Melveny & Myers investigation, there's also an open Title IX investigation into UVA by the U.S. Department of Education as a result of a civil suit. The attorney who filed the suit, James Marsh, told CNN that UVA medical staff lost or destroyed evidence from the alleged sexual assault victim he's representing, making it impossible for her to move forward and get justice. When the Columbia Journalism School's 12,000-plus-word critique is summed up, it really boils down to this: The mistake could have been avoided if the writer, Sabrina Rubin Erdely, had picked up the phone and made just a few more phone calls to the friends of Jackie who she claimed were with her that night. They'd later tell other media outlets, including CNN, that they remembered a very different story. Rolling Stone says their account would have been a red flag. And all three say they would have talked if they'd been called. Ryan Duffin, one of the trio, said he felt deceived by Jackie, but he also pointed out that Erdely's mistake in fact-checking was about one single incident, and the fallout has caused a much bigger issue to be lost. "Had she gotten in direct contact with us, it probably wouldn't have been printed, at least in that way," he said. "A lot of the article was still based in truth, but the focal point would have been different." It might have been less dramatic, but it would have probably focused on some of the other UVA students who shared much more common stories of acquaintance rape on campus. "I think my problem with it was that this reporter wanted to sensationalize an experience that's not very common," Roderick said. "... And I wonder if it would have been different if (it dealt) with someone with a less horrific story -- something that happens to more people. I think this discredits what a lot of survivors go through. Something this physically horrific is not what everyone goes through. Now it's like, 'If I wasn't assaulted by more than one man then my story is not as worthy of attention.' It's frustrating that this is how rape is portrayed on college campuses because this is not the norm." Before the report came out, Abraham Axler, the student body president, said that some good had come from the article because it forced UVA to institute new policies and to open up a conversation on a topic that needed to be discussed nationwide. But some survivors and advocates are afraid the retraction set back their progress. "I do feel like there's a possibility people will be afraid to come forward. If you come forward and share your story, if you don't have the date right, every detail down, you'll think, 'I'm going to be accused of being a liar. It's easier for me to keep it to myself,'" Roderick said. "There are very serious and unresolved questions about the university's performance," said Steve Coll, dean of the Columbia School of Journalism. "Rolling Stone teed that subject up. I wouldn't say that everything about Rolling Stone's treatment of that subject was perfect, but it certainly doesn't fall under the same category as their reporting about Jackie's narrative."

Article: How good to welcome Padraig Harrington back to Augusta after a year’s absence, complete with his weird and wonderful practice-ground routines. On Friday, he was at it again, but my favourite moment remains his plaintive lament after a mediocre round: ‘I’m focusing so much on my focus I’m over-focused.’ Padraig Harrington hits a tee shot on the fourth hole during the second day of the Masters on Friday. METH ON THE RISE. Headline writers everywhere will be keeping fingers crossed that golf continues to prove an addiction for the highly rated US Public Links champion Byron Meth, who opened with a 74 on his Masters debut. As for the golfing scribes, we’re just waiting for the blessed day when he meets a lovely girl called Crystal. Byron Meth makes a chip shot on the second hole as the American amateur continues to impress at Augusta. PAR FOUR PROBLEMS. The stats from a brilliant day one made fascinating reading. The par fives are the scoring holes and lived up to their billing since all of them had a scoring average under the regulation mark. The par fours, though, are where you hang on. Half had a scoring average of 4.2 or higher, with the 11th yielding just three birdies all day. TAKING POETIC LICENSE. Top marks to the Augusta Chronicle columnist who wrote a poem about the merchandise pavilion in the 1990s so good he decided to share it with his readers again on Friday. ‘They came, they saw, they bought souvenirs,’ it begins. I know how terribly disappointed you’ll be that space permits me from sharing with you the 23 stanzas that followed. Jordan Spieth marks his ball in the 15th hole during the second round of action at Augusta. NICKLAUS OR ‘99’? In addition to being able to buy an Arnold Palmer as your drink of choice in Augusta you can now have Jack Nicklaus ice cream for dessert. No word yet, however, on when Bubba Watson’s Marmite or Ben Crenshaw’s treacle hits the shelves. As for Tiger Woods, he’ll surely launch his own iced lolly soon. Jack Nicklaus waves to the crowd before hitting off on the first tee during the honorary starters ceremony. AUGUSTA SEES REDS. It is not just former Liverpool captain Jamie Redknapp who’s enjoying these sacred acres this week but the club’s greatest ever player as well. I’m going to guess mad-keen golfer Kenny Dalglish was quite happy when wife Marina produced tickets as an anniversary present. Patrons watch the play at the 16th hole during a thrilling second day of play in Augusta.

Byron Meth opened with a 74 on his Masters debut. Half of the players had a scoring average of 4.2 or higher on day one. Liverpool legend Kenny Dalglish will be present at the Masters this week.

Article: (CNN)Change is coming to Ferguson. In the next few weeks the Department of Justice (DOJ) will begin to negotiate in earnest with the city to restructure the police department, which the department has charged with engaging in a pattern and practice of racial discrimination. It should not be forgotten that the DOJ review of the Ferguson Police Department was precipitated by months of protests and activism following the killing of Michael Brown by a Ferguson police officer and by revelations about the town's dysfunctional government and court system by local civil rights law groups. Now, after a half year of unrest, and with citizens on Tuesday electing two new black city council members, change is beginning to come to Ferguson. The question is, what kind of change? The report from the Department of Justice offered a devastating insight into a police department and court system that preyed on its own citizens. Through illegal traffic stops and arrests, and the use of excessive force, the police department held town residents in bondage. The municipal court system used excessive court fines and fees to ensure that citizens arrested for even minor infractions would be charged thousands of dollars or face jail time. Court costs and fees constituted the second-largest sources of revenue for the town. Rather than a force for public safety, the Ferguson Police Department became, according to Attorney General Eric Holder, "a collection agency" -- one that preyed disproportionately on the town's African-American residents. The evidence of ugly and explicit racial discrimination was devastating. It included blatantly racist emails traded among officers, and evidence that African-Americans were victims in all of the police canine bite incidents recorded by the department. But just a few weeks before the release of the report, the Ferguson police chief declared there were "no racial issues" in his department. Ferguson's ugly, racist emails released. The recommendations in the report, ranging from new training and supervision of police officers, addressing racially discriminatory conduct to structural revisions in the court system, will, if implemented, remake the law enforcement system in the town. (A grand jury that investigated the shooting of Brown by Officer Darren Wilson chose not to file charges against him and the Justice Department also didn't find reason to prosecute.) Without question, change is coming to the town's government. Town Manager John Shaw, Ferguson's most powerful official and, until the DOJ's blistering report, the one who inexplicably managed to elude public scrutiny, resigned weeks ago and has been replaced by the city's deputy manager. Three sitting city council members chose not to run for office again and, on Tuesday, citizens elected two black candidates to the city council, changing its racial composition: Five of six members and the mayor were white. Now the council will be 50% black. Ferguson's hapless police Chief Thomas Jackson also finally resigned after holding on through a months-long display of astonishing incompetence. The department first drew the attention of the nation for its display of military weaponry and tear gas in response to civilian protests.  The appointment of a commander from the State Highway Patrol was deemed necessary to begin quelling the unrest and to build community trust in the early days of the protest. Jackson's departure sent an important signal to the population of a town preyed upon by officers under his command. And so we can be certain that along with the new makeup of the city council, there will be a new police chief in Ferguson. But does that mean that fundamental change will come to Ferguson? Not necessarily. Not unless protest and activism during this critical period turns to influence the vitally important opportunities that lie ahead in the coming weeks. The Department of Justice's full-on negotiations with the leadership in Ferguson will determine the shape of the new Ferguson Police Department. Indeed, the DOJ report alludes to the possibility of disbanding the department in favor of a regional policing integration with St. Louis County. Many local activists have suggested just such a solution, but given ongoing problems with policing in the county -- including the role of county forces in some of the most controversial clashes with activists in Ferguson last fall -- community representatives will have to fight hard to ensure that the DOJ can fold St. Louis County Police into its monitoring and reform process. Equally important were the April 7 general elections. Turnout in municipal elections has been notoriously low in Ferguson, with white voters nearly three times more likely to turn out than African-Americans. But local groups had engaged in vigorous voter registration and get-out-the-vote campaigns.. The Mayor has two years left to his term and has defiantly insisted that he will not resign (although a petition for his recall has been circulating). That means that he will be a lead voice in negotiating with the DOJ to remake the police department. Has he committed to a clear set of principles that will guide his participation in those talks? Community activists and residents must ensure that Mayor James Knowles plans to represent their vision of new Ferguson Police Department. But there is an opportunity to begin thinking about even more ambitious structural change in Ferguson and throughout St. Louis County. Ferguson's governing structure, with a strong city manager and a weak council and mayor, mirrors that of thousands of other suburbs in the United States. That form of governance might have been precisely what thriving, middle class white suburbanites wanted when they fled racial integration in cities like St. Louis. But working class suburbs like Ferguson with a majority black population in which the needs of the population in the areas of education and economic opportunity more closely hews to the needs of urban residents, may need a more robust form of governance. In any case, a system in which the elected officials have minimal power, but non-elected leaders, like the town manager and the chief of police, have inordinate power, is a recipe for the kind of unaccountable, non-representative government that controlled Ferguson's residents. Yet this precise form of government is in wide use across the country. Likewise, Missouri, like the vast majority of states, holds municipal elections in non-presidential election years, guaranteeing a significantly lower voter turnout -- although only a few states hold the primary and general election in March and April as Missouri law requires Ferguson to do. It's not that Ferguson is so different than towns across America. It's precisely because Ferguson holds up a mirror to flaws in our democratic system of government in towns across this country that the stakes are so high. Ferguson residents now have the opportunity to begin a movement for change in the other 89 jurisdictions in St. Louis County plagued by similar governance flaws, including those towns led by African-Americans. And Ferguson's example should provoke self-examination in working class suburbs across the country, where the power and effectiveness of weak elected local government is inadequate to meet the needs of the population. Change is coming to Ferguson. But the scope and breadth of that change will depend upon the ambition and discipline of activists and residents, whose passion and tenacity have already transformed the trajectory of leadership in a typical American town.

Article: Real Madrid winger Gareth Bale will be rested for Saturday's La Liga game at home to Eibar, coach Carlo Ancelotti said on Friday, meaning the Welshman joins suspended midfielders Toni Kroos and James Rodriguez on the sidelines. Ancelotti said he had not made a final decision on who would come into his starting lineup for the game at the Bernabeu, when second-placed Real will look to close the gap on leaders Barcelona, who play at Sevilla later on Saturday, to one point. Asier Illarramendi and Isco will probably play alongside Luka Modric in midfield, with Jese joining Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema up front. Gareth Bale (centre) is being rested by Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti for the Eibar clash. The Real Madrid boss is to give young players Jese and Asier Illarramendi a game on Saturday. 'All I can say is that Illarra and Jese have a very good chance of playing,' Ancelotti told a news conference. Real at least have Ronaldo available after the Spanish soccer federation (RFEF) rescinded a yellow card the Portugal forward was shown in Wednesday's 2-0 win at Rayo Vallecano which would have carried a one-match suspension. Ronaldo is the La Liga's top scorer this season with 37 goals, four ahead of Barcelona's Argentina forward Lionel Messi. Cristiano Ronaldo will play and hopes to add to his already 37 goals in La Liga, the league's highest. Karim Benzema (R) and Alvaro Arbeloa in action during a training session at Valdebebas training ground. Ancelotti said Ronaldo's Portugal team mate Pepe, a centre back, would be available both for Saturday and Tuesday's Champions League quarter-final, first leg at Atletico Madrid after a short injury layoff. Germany midfielder Sami Khedira and Portugal left back Fabio Coentrao have back and knee problems respectively and will not be in the squad for the Eibar game. The modest Basque club are playing in Spain's top flight for the first time this season but a recent poor run has left them in 14th with eight games left, in danger of dropping straight back down to the second division. Pepe (centre) is back in contention for Real's clash with Eibar and Atletico Madrid to play after an injury. 'Our thought is only to play a good match and compete, which is a word we use a lot in our dressing-room,' Eibar coach Gaizka Garitano told Marca sports daily in an interview published on Friday. 'We are not coming with any fear,' added the 39-year-old, who will be keen to avoid a repeat of the 9-1 thrashing Real dealt Granada at the Bernabeu last weekend. 'We defend well,' he said. 'We have lost quite a few games recently but nobody has scored more than two goals against us in those defeats.' Madrid are four points behind rivals Barcelona in the La Liga title race and can't afford to slip-up.

Article: Arsenal have been here before. Manchester City sniffing around with their millions, looking to prize away some of Arsene Wenger's finest talent. Jack Wilshere is the latest man linked with a switch to the Etihad Stadium, where he would follow the likes of Emmanuel Adebayor, Bacary Sagna and Samir Nasri who swapped London for the North-West as City stormed towards Premier League and FA Cup glory. But times have changed. The Gunners are now ahead of City in the table and appear to be a club on the up, while the men from Manchester must rebuild. And if £30million or more is truly on the table for Wilshere, Arsenal must consider it. Manchester CIty are considering making a move for Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere this summer. Wilshere hasn't played for the first team since injuring his ankle against Manchester United in November. Alexis Sanchez cost Arsenal £30m, while Chelsea splashed out roughly the same amount to bring in Diego Costa. Those two forwards have a combined total of 33 league goals this season. And for all Wilshere's many talents, he would not be a game changer for Manuel Pellegrini, or whoever City's manager may be next season. He was touted as a future Arsenal and England midfielder when he burst onto the scene, showing the world what he can do in a Champions League tie against Barcelona, and possesses a technical ability which wouldn't see him out of place at the Nou Camp. His quick movement, superb touch and low centre of gravity is perfect for the sharp, driving style of play manager Wenger likes at the Emirates Stadium, as Wilshere's goal of the season against Norwich last season perfectly demonstrated. He has been doubted on several occasions, partly because of his lifestyle off the pitch, in the most part because of his treacherous injury record at the age of 23. The midfielder has picked up a total of 24 knocks during his seven-year professional career. He was tipped as a future Arsenal star and England international when he broke through the ranks in 2008. Wilshere is only 23 years old but has picked up 24 separate injuries during his professional career. But even as recently as this season, Wilshere was hitting form before going off against Manchester United. He was certainly more impressive than Aaron Ramsey and Santi Cazorla in the Arsenal midfield, and impressed for England in a deep-lying role. There now seems to be little space for the Stevenage-born schemer to fit in this starting XI. Ramsey, Cazorla, Sanchez, Francis Coquelin, and Mesut Ozil played behind Olivier Giroud in the recent thumping victory over Liverpool, and that's without the likes of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Tomas Rosicky, Theo Walcott and Danny Welbeck involved. Of course, the ideal state of play would be for Wenger to build a team around Wilshere, a man who is signed on for three more years, and not to consider any bids from divisional rivals at least. But Arsenal would be foolish to dismiss anything over £30m in today's market, especially considering the kind of players Wenger can now attract to the club. Wilshere impressed in a holding role for England in an international friendly against Scotland last year. He was in form before ankle surgery, scoring a fine goal against Manchester City in September. The midfielder fired past Brad Guzan to score the opening goal against Aston Villa last season. Wilshere's effort against Norwich was voted the 2013-14 Premier League Goal of the Season. Arsenal's relationship with City, who the club have never held a firm rivalry with, could also play a part. Any interest from fellow top-four clubs Chelsea or Manchester United would probably be dismissed immediately. The current Premier League champions are looking to rebuild under Sheik Mansour and need homegrown, young players to freshen up an ageing side. Wilshere is seen as a possibility along with Jordan Henderson in midfield. Raheem Sterling and Paul Pogba have also been linked with a summer transfer, with Nasri and Yaya Toure among many names who could leave. But with Liverpool set to hand Henderson the captain's armband after Steven Gerrard's departure, his stay would seem more likely despite his contract running down at Anfield. Arsenal fans would hate to see Wilshere go and he encapsulates the style at the Emirates. However, for a man who has scored five goals in his league career, and one who would not neccessarily push on close rivals to better things, it may be worth thinking about. Jordan Henderson is also a possibility for Manchester City as the club look for homegrown youngsters.

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence.
Manchester City considering bid for Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere. Jordan Henderson is also an option for the Premier League champions. Wilshere, 23, encapsulates Arsene Wenger's style of play in north London. But the England international is not necessarily a first-team regular. Any bids in excess of £30m should be considered by Arsenal.

Article: Atlanta (CNN)A passenger on an Atlanta-bound Air Canada flight told a CNN reporter on the plane Friday that a stranger sitting behind him tried to choke him. Oliver Minatel, 22, said he was sleeping on Air Canada Flight 8623 from Toronto when he felt something around his neck. "With a rope, something that he has, he just jumped on me. That's what happened," Minatel told CNN's Paula Newton moments after the incident. She was seated four rows behind Minatel, a professional soccer player traveling with his team. The incident occurred about a half-hour before the flight landed, after the pilots had begun their descent. "I forced it (the cord) down and then other people came to help, and then I got out and he started saying that we were here to kill him," Minatel said. The man was not restrained for the rest of the trip, but the flight crew told him to stay seated with his seat belt on. The man kept trying to get out of his seat but other passengers yelled at him whenever he tried to stand up. The two-hour flight landed at Atlanta's Hartsfield airport at about 4:30 p.m.  where it was met by U.S. authorities.  The suspect was escorted off the plane. An FBI spokesman confirmed the agency responded to the incident. "The passenger, however, was transported for medical/mental evaluation under the direction and coordination of the Atlanta Police Department," Special Agent Stephen Emmett said. "While there are currently no federal charges pending, the facts of the matter are being relayed to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Atlanta." Minatel, a forward from Brazil, was traveling with his teammates from the Ottawa Fury Football Club of the second-division North American Soccer League.  They are scheduled to play the Atlanta Silverbacks on Saturday. "We're very thankful to everyone who came to the aid of Oliver and relieved that he's O.K. and ready to play in our game," Fury FC Head Coach Marc Dos Santos said in a statement posted on the team's website. Several witnesses said they saw the suspect try to choke Minatel with the cord of his headphones. Kevin Kerr says he was seated next to the suspect. "He was talking about how this soccer team was trying to kill him. I thought he was maybe a deranged fan," said Kerr. Kerr said he fell asleep and he awakened to see the suspect trying to choke Minatel. "I assisted to make sure that didn't happen," Kerr said. The Canadian businessman said he and members of the soccer team kept a close eye on the suspect as the plane landed to make sure he did not threaten other passengers.

Article: Their clubs have experienced contrasting fortunes on the pitch in recent weeks but Danny Welbeck and several of the Liverpool squad appear to share a mutual fondness for Nicki Minaj. The Gunners forward was spotted arriving at the Manchester Arena on Monday night to watch the pop star perform, two days after his side thrashed the Reds 4-1 at the Emirates. Liverpool full back Jose Enrique was also in attendance at the concert along with team-mates Alberto Moreno and Mamadou Sakho.

And while the the Liverpool players might have been enjoying Minaj's 2014 hit 'Anaconda', Brendan Rodgers would almost certainly have still been reeling from a heavy defeat that strangled the life out of the club's hopes of reaching the Champions League. Enrique, who took to Instagram to share a few snaps from the night out, was pleasantly surprised at how much he enjoyed the performance. 'Great night at #nickiminaj concert. Better than I expect it. Really enjoy it. Good night,' the Spanish defender wrote on the social media site. Mesut Ozil is congratulated by his team-mates after scoring during the 4-1 win on Saturday. Alexis Sanchez celebrates with Olivier Giroud after his stunning strike from just outside the penalty area. Hector Bellerin, Mesut Ozil, Alexis Sanchez and Olivier Giroud struck to condemn Liverpool to their second consecutive Premier League defeat as Jordan Henderson netted for the Reds.

Article: (CNN)A federal grand jury has charged millionaire real estate heir Robert Durst, a convicted felon, with unlawful possession of a firearm. In this week's indictment,  Durst, 71, is accused of possessing a.38 caliber revolver, which authorities allegedly found in his hotel room last month. He faces a maximum of 10 years in prison if found guilty of that charge, according to the indictment. The charge is the latest in a litany of accusations. A Louisiana judge ruled last month that Durst, who is charged with first-degree murder, will be held without bail at a facility near New Orleans. Durst was featured this spring in "The Jinx," a HBO documentary about him. He's accused of killing his friend  Susan Berman at her home in California in 2000. He also faces state weapons and drugs charges in New Orleans. Last month, court documents claimed that Durst had a loaded.38-caliber revolver, marijuana, his passport and birth certificate, a latex mask with salt-and-pepper hair attached and more than $40,000 cash. He also had a UPS tracking number. The package was intercepted by the FBI, prosecutors said, and it contained clothing and more than $100,000 in cash. But the bigger courtroom fight will probably unfold in Los Angeles, where the district attorney filed a first-degree murder charge against Durst last month. He awaits extradition to Los Angeles to face that charge. If convicted, he could face the death penalty. Prosecutors accuse Durst of "lying in wait" and killing Berman, a crime writer and his longtime confidante, because she "was a witness to a crime." Berman was shot in the head in her Beverly Hills home in December 2000, shortly before investigators were set to speak with her about the 1982 disappearance of Durst's first wife, Kathleen McCormack Durst. Durst has long maintained that he had nothing to do with Berman's death or his wife's disappearance. It's not the first time he has been accused of murder. He admitted killing and dismembering his neighbor at a 2003 trial, but he was acquitted after arguing that he acted in self-defense. FBI agents have also asked local authorities to examine cold cases in locations near where Durst lived over the past five decades, a U.S. law enforcement official said. Unsolved cases in Vermont, upstate New York, the San Francisco Bay Area and Southern California are among those getting a new look, the official said. Durst's attorney, Dick DeGuerin, said it's a sign that authorities are desperate. DeGuerin has said Durst has serious medical conditions. He is suffering from hydrocephalus, which required brain surgery a couple of years ago, DeGuerin said. Doctors implanted a stent on the right side of his head, the attorney said. "At the same time he was in the hospital, he had an operation on his esophagus to remove cancer. So he's got some serious health issues.... He's lost a lot of weight. He's not in good health," DeGuerin said. DeGuerin also said that Durst is "mildly autistic" and has received treatment in the past from one of the country's leading experts in Asperger's syndrome and autism.

Article: Ander Herrera says he bares his full name on the back of his shirt for superstitious reasons following his spell at Athletic Bilbao. In a short Q&A video posted on the club's Facebook page on Tuesday morning, the Manchester United midfielder revealed that he wears both his forename and surname in order to carry on his form that earned him the move to the English giants last summer. Herrera joined the Red Devils for £29million following a relatively successful three-year period at Bilbao where he reached the Copa del Rey and the Europa League finals in his debut season at the club in 2011-12. Ander Herrera says he bares his forename and surname on the back of shirt for supersitution. The Manchester United (right) midfielder cites his reasons following a good spell at Athletic Bilbao. Herrera (left) reached the Copa del Rey and the Europa League finals in his debut season at Bilbao in 2011-12. 'I'm superstitious. I started using Ander Herrera from Athletic [Bilbao] three years ago and I think I had a very good three years in Bilbao so I wanted to keep using that,' he answered following a supporter's question. After a stop-start beginning to life at Old Trafford, Herrera has forced his way into Louis van Gaal's starting line-up with a series of impressive displays that have coincided with the club's upturn in results. The 25-year-old took his tally to seven goals in all competitions this season with his double as United won 3-1 at home to Aston Villa in the Premier League on Saturday. Herrera's celebrations were both met with so much emotion - something the Spaniard has admitted it's not uncommon to him in the past. And adding in the Q&A video, he hopes to show a lot more emotion as United target silverware in the future. 'Every win, every victory make me happy but I hope the most emotional moments are coming I'm sure of that because I'm at Manchester United,' he said. The 25-year-old (left) was on target twice as United beat Aston Villa in the Premier League on Saturday.

Article: (CNN)The graffiti, written in a French chalk quarry and dating back almost 100 years, is plain and stark. "HJ Leach. Merely a private. 13/7/16. SA Australia," reads one inscription. "HA Deanate, 148th Aero Squadron, USA. 150 Vermilyea Ave, New York City," another says. "9th Batt Australians, G. Fitzhenry, Paddington, Sydney, N.S.W., 1916 July; Alistair Ross, Lismore, July," reads a third. They were World War I soldiers, four of almost 2,000, whose writings have recently been found underneath battlefields near Naours, France, about 120 miles north of Paris. Photographer Jeff Gusky, who has been chronicling details of the site, describes the inscriptions -- and the underground city in which they were found -- as "breathtaking." "This is a treasure trove," he said Monday night from his home in East Texas, where he works as an ER doctor. "Even locally, no one realized what was there." Gusky, a National Geographic photographer, has chronicled the area in a portfolio he calls "The Hidden World of WWI." The revelations of the underground city, which extends for miles in some directions, have come to light recently only because of a series of events, Gusky said. The underground city actually dates back centuries but was sealed up in the 18th century. It was rediscovered in the late 19th century. During World War I, soldiers would take refuge in the carved-out rooms and pathways. The front was sometimes mere miles away; the Battle of the Somme, one of the bloodiest in world history, was fought nearby in 1916. The land was privately owned for many years and generally off-limits to outsiders, said Gusky, but it changed hands in 2013. The rights to operate it were purchased by a consortium of villages that wanted to promote awareness of the area's history, he said. Researching the city is a painstaking task. For one thing, it's dark, so observers generally haven't realized what's in there until they've gone exploring. Moreover, the maze-like extensiveness of the site has made discovery a slow process. "They go on and on and on. They're so elaborate in some places, there are maps carved into stone so the soldiers wouldn't get lost," he said. The graffiti looks like it was written yesterday, he added. Gusky has noted 1,821 names. About 40% are Australian, with most of the others identified as British. Fifty-five are Americans, and 662 have yet to be traced. For Gusky, the graffiti provides a human connection with men who lived a century ago. In many cases, they just wanted to be remembered, he said. "Someone could be in this place one day and the next fighting at the front," he said. Leach, "merely a private," was killed a month later in battle, Gusky observed. "It could very well have been the last time he recorded his name as a living, breathing human being," he said. 7 things you didn't know about the man who started WWI.

Article: As seasons go, this one has been pretty close to perfect for Bristol City. Runaway leaders in Sky Bet League One, they became the first team in the Football League to mathematically secure promotion on Tuesday night - and in sensational style. Hitting Bradford City for six of the best in their own backyard saw them triumphantly over the finishing line, although given their free-wheeling and free-scoring form the result really came as little surprise. Aden Flint celebrates with a bottle of Sky Bet champagne following Bristol City's promotion. City players are sprayed with champagne after securing promotion from League One. And there’s more. Add to that their memorable Johnstone’s Paint Trophy victory at Wembley last month - when Walsall were comfortably beaten 2-0 in the final - and you have a truly historic campaign for Steve Cotterill’s team. The season has been a personal triumph for tall, tattooed defender Aden Flint, who has played a central role in returning City to the Championship after two seasons away. His uncompromising defensive style has been combined with a knack of scoring from set-pieces, leading to 11 goals this season. Flint was on target at Wembley, fulfilling a childhood dream in the process, and also at Valley Parade on Tuesday. The Robins stars shower each other in their isotonic drinks following victory against Bradford City on Tuesday. Flint scores his side's fourth goal of the game as City earn an impressive 6-0 at Valley Parade. ‘When the players and the manager sat down at the start of the season, we had three aims,’ he tells Sportsmail. ‘The first was to win promotion back to the Championship, the second was to go up as champions and the third was to win the Johnstone's Paint Trophy. ‘We've managed to do two of the three and hopefully on Saturday we can achieve the other.’ That’s because City need another win to make absolutely sure they will be promoted as champions. The 25-year-old defender celebrates as the Robins earned promotion to the Championship in style. City manager Steve Cotterill celebrates promotion with a commemorative bottle of champagne. They currently lead Preston North End by 10 points but the Lancashire side have a game in hand and so three points are required against Coventry City at Ashton Gate this weekend. ‘Nobody wants that runners-up medal. The aim was always to go up as champions and we’re close to achieving that,’ Flint says. ‘We’ve had that winning habit and it’s a good one to get in to. We’ve been top of the league for most of the season and to drop down to second now would be disappointing.’ Seldom does one team dominate a division in this way. The lowest City have been placed is fifth and that was after their opening day fixture. The Robins have enjoyed a memorable season which has included lifting the Johnstone's Paint Trophy. Once again, Flint (right) made a huge contribution, giving City the lead against Walsall on March 22. Flint wheels away in celebration after sending his side on their way to another memorable victory. Cotterill (left) and Jay Emmanuel-Thomas look delighted as they celebrate with the trophy at Wembley. They kicked on from there and set a ferocious pace throughout the autumn. Since September 13th, there has only been one week when they haven’t been top of the pile and they have lost just three games in all competitions since the New Year. Not that success has been reserved for the league. They reached the fourth round of the FA Cup, losing narrowly to Premier League West Ham, and claimed the Trophy too in front of over 40,000 of their fans at Wembley. Flint said: ‘I think any player dreams of scoring and winning at Wembley. There really isn't a better feeling in football. It is right up there with the highlights in my career but I would say that if we win on Saturday and go up as champions, that will push Wembley out.’ The defender’s goalscoring exploits have come as a surprise but he’s quick to credit his team-mates for the service: ‘I didn't expect to score as many as five to be honest! Flint holds the JPT with pride as he celebrates the 2-0 victory against Walsall last month. The defender was also named the Sky Bet League 1 Player of the Month for March. ‘I've just found myself in the right place at the right time to get on the end of all those set-pieces that have been delivered by the lads. ‘Aaron Wilbraham has bags of experience with him and has scored over 20 goals this season. Luke Freeman and Marlon Pack have been providing plenty of assists, not just for me but for everyone. ‘But everyone has chipped in, it has been a collective effort. The team spirit here has been the best I've ever experienced and it's been an enjoyable season.’ Promotion back to the Championship could be just the beginning of an exciting chapter in the club’s 118-year history. Aaron Wilbraham (right) has scored 18 domestic goals for the high-flying Robins this season. Billionaire owner Steve Lansdown (left) is funding a renovation of the club’s Ashton Gate home. Billionaire owner Steve Lansdown, who made his fortune in financial services, is funding a renovation of the club’s Ashton Gate home to expand the capacity to 27,000 and make it Premier League-ready. And, according to Flint, that’s precisely where the club is aiming: ‘We aim high and should be in the Championship, if not higher than that. ‘It's a massive city, I didn't realise how big it is until I moved here. It's surprising that the place hasn't got a Premier League team and maybe we can change that. ‘The chairman and the manager certainly have the ambition to achieve that. Seeing Bournemouth and Brentford doing so well in the Championship, nobody expected that and, who knows what will happen when we get there next season.’

Bristol City have earned promotion to the Championship. 25-year-old Aden Flint has been crucial to their promotion push. Flint has chipped in with an impressive 11 goals so far this season.

Article: Durham, North Carolina (CNN)President Obama's nomination of Loretta Lynch to become the country's first African-American woman attorney general is a historic pick.  Her confirmation, however, is now taking on new historical relevance as her wait for a confirmation vote by the full Senate drags into its sixth month. The period between the Senate Judiciary Committee's vote to confirm and the full Senate vote -- which in Lynch's case has not been scheduled -- has lasted longer for her than for any attorney general nominee in recent history. By the time the Senate returns from Easter recess on Monday, it'll have been longer than the eight previous nominees for the job -- combined. Lynch, currently the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, cleared the committee February 26 by a vote of 12-8, with Republican Sens. Orrin Hatch of Utah, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Jeff Flake of Arizona joining Democrats in sending the nomination to the full Senate. Obama nominated Lynch to replace Attorney General Eric Holder on November 8, after Holder had announced plans to leave the post weeks earlier. Hundreds of miles from Washington, longtime residents of Durham, North Carolina, were beaming with pride.  Lynch's family moved to the city when she was a child.  Her parents, married for 60 years, still live there.  They watched the announcement on television. "That was encouraging but I knew then that we had a fight on our hands," said Lynch's father, the Rev. Lorenzo Lynch.  "I've been in politics most of my life. I know that nothing is certain, and I know that nothing is easy." Lorenzo Lynch, 82, is a retired Baptist preacher and was active in the civil rights movement of the 1960s.  He ran, unsuccessfully, for mayor of Durham in 1973. For the next round of his daughter's "fight," he traveled to Washington in late January to attend his daughter's confirmation hearing before the Judiciary Committee. "I heard a lot at that hearing that I've heard since childhood.  That is the presupposition of the mindset," Lorenzo Lynch said.  "The dual system or the dual treatment." When asked to provide specific examples, Lorenzo Lynch deferred to the state branch of the NAACP and E. Lavonia Allison, a Durham activist who has known Loretta Lynch since the family moved to Durham. "I don't want to think about the epidermis, but some people are thinking that way," Allison said, suggesting that Lynch's confirmation vote has been delayed because Lynch is African-American. "When it has taken so long, when it has been so different from any other person who has been nominated... how else can we interpret that it is so different?" Allison said. In March, Rep. G.K. Butterfield, D-North Carolina, chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said, "I think race certainly can be considered as a major factor in the reason for this delay, but it's also the irrationality of the new Republicans." Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, evoked imagery of the segregated South in criticism of Republicans, saying Lynch had been "asked to sit in the back of the bus when it comes to the Senate calendar." Durbin was harshly criticized by Arizona's Sen. John McCain. "I deeply regret that the senator from Illinois chose to come here yesterday and question the integrity and motivation, mine and my Republican colleagues," McCain said on the Senate floor.  "It was offensive and unnecessary, and I think he owes this body, Ms. Lynch and all Americans an apology," McCain added. "I thought he should be commended," Lorenzo Lynch said.  "I think that's a poetic description of what has happened and poetry, like most language, is limited but it does have wings... to carry a point." Giuliani pushes for Lynch confirmation. Senate Republicans adamantly deny the delay in scheduling a vote on Lynch's nomination is because she is African-American. Many point out that Lynch, if confirmed, will be replacing the country's first African-American attorney general who was confirmed by an overwhelming margin. Instead, Republicans and Democrats say the delay is part of an ongoing partisan battle.  For some, it's part of a fight over a human trafficking bill that has stalled in the Senate.  For others, the delay is retaliation for President Obama's 2014 executive actions on immigration. On the eve of Holder's announcement of his plans to leave the Department of Justice, the political number crunchers at FiveThirtyEight.com predicted that whoever the President nominated would "likely face at least a moderately tough confirmation hearing in the Senate." Some of Lynch's supporters across North Carolina have organized to convince the state's two Republican senators to support Lynch's confirmation.  In March, several dozen North Carolina women, led by the NAACP, traveled to Washington to meet with their senators, Richard Burr and Thom Tillis. Reportedly, the meeting lasted nearly an hour and was very cordial. At a news conference at the Washington Press Club, the group blasted the senators for opposing the nomination. "Senator Burr and Senator Tillis, it is time for you to act like you have some sense.  It's past time.  You have embarrassed the state of North Carolina," Allison said after the meeting. For their part, Burr and Tillis released a statement after the meeting: "While we remain concerned with Ms. Lynch's stated desire to lead the Department of Justice in the same manner as Eric Holder and will not be supporting her nomination, we are grateful that the group came to Washington to talk about this issue and exchange ideas. Weeks later, the NAACP organized protests outside the senators' offices in Raleigh, Charlotte and Wilmington. "I think there is a much deeper analysis," said North Carolina NAACP Branch President Rev. William Barber II.  "I believe if she had been Clarence Thomas, she would have been confirmed." "Because of her courage, her character and her commitment to the law and to the enforcement of the laws of this land, particularly the 14th and 15th amendments to the Constitution, and because her consciousness was shaped in the crucible of the civil rights movement -- that is what they fear," Barber said. Obama turns up the heat on Loretta Lynch confirmation 'limbo' Lorenzo Lynch says he carried his daughter to several civil rights marches on his shoulders.  He admits that he did not think that much of the recent progress of African-Americans was possible when he was fighting for equal rights. Now, his small living room is filled with stacks of loosely organized newspaper stories about his daughter's nomination and photos of his visit to the White House. Lynch admits that he's never told his only daughter that he's proud of her, although he's sure she knows it.  He plans to change that, soon, regardless of the outcome of her pending nomination.

Article: Rory McIlroy was joined by Niall Horan at the Masters on Wednesday and the World's best golfer is set to return the favour by singing on stage with the One Direction star at the end of the summer. Horan fell while caddying for the Northern Irish golfer in the traditional Par-3 Contest at Augusta while he also hit a ball into the water on the ninth tee, but the Irish singer will get some payback in September. McIlroy is set to compete at the Deutsche Bank Championship which occurs a few days after One Direction play Gillette Stadium in Massachusetts on September 12 - and Horan revealed that the pair will reunite on stage in Boston. One Direction singer Niall Horan caddied for Rory McIlroy in the traditional Par-3 Contest at Augusta National. Horan had a embarrassing moment when he slipped over while carrying McIlroy's clubs on the  course. Sky Sports' cameras captured the moment when Horan suffered a slip while caddying for McIlroy. McIlroy steps aside to let the One Direction singer Horan tee off on the ninth hole at Augusta National. The Masters official Twitter account shared an image of Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods with Niall Horan. 'That was part of the deal,' Horan told the Golf Channel. 'If I went on the bag with him, he would come on stage and sing with us. 'He's playing in the Deutche in Boston at the end of the summer and we're playing in the Gillette Stadium in Foxboro in the same week, so we going to get him up. 'He said if he's allowed pick the song then he's going to do it.' Asked whether he has ever heard McIlroy in full voice, Horan replied: 'No, but apparently, he's terrible.'

Article: (CNN)Are we alone in the cosmos? Or might there be intelligent life elsewhere? Last week, NASA scientists discussed in very concrete terms the steps to discovering life elsewhere in the universe over the next decade or two. This year is the 20th anniversary of the discovery of a planet around a star like our own sun, 51 Pegasi. Since then, ground-based surveys and NASA's Kepler satellite have discovered nearly 2,000 confirmed "exoplanets," and thousands more candidates await confirmation. Many of these planetary systems are quite unlike our own solar system. Some have large planets like Jupiter that orbit their stars far closer than Mercury, the innermost planet in our solar system. But smaller rocky planets like Earth, though harder to find, appear to be even more abundant. Life on Earth developed in its oceans about a billion years after the planet formed. That suggests that rocky planets with liquid water on their surfaces might also have developed primitive forms of life. Life as we know it is carbon-based and requires liquid water. Astronomers define the "habitable zone" around a star as the region within which liquid water can exist on a planet's surface. Any closer to the star, the water will boil into vapor; any farther and the water freezes into ice. Extrapolating from discoveries to date, astronomers estimate there are perhaps 40 billion Earth-like, habitable-zone planets in our Milky Way galaxy alone. Of course, there is a difference between single-celled organisms -- which developed 3.8 billion years ago and remained the most sophisticated form of life for another billion years or so -- and mammals, which appeared about 200 million years ago. And then the humans, who have existed for only 200,000 years. Intelligent life that can communicate via radio waves with other intelligent life is less than 100 years old here on Earth. So while planets that develop simple forms of life may be a dime a dozen, the number that have sentient beings with whom to converse -- even assuming they evolved as humans did, with ears and spoken language, or eyes and written language -- is likely to be tiny. And life that can use radio waves has existed on Earth for only 0.000002% of the planet's history -- 100 years out of 4.5 billion. If the half dozen or so rocky, Earth-like exoplanets now known are similar, the odds of discovering humanlike life on them are about the same as, well, winning your state lottery with one ticket. Of course, if there are 40 billion Earth-like planets out there, the odds improve quite a bit. If they all have histories like the Earth's, there might be 1,000 planets in the Milky Way that could support communicative beings. But before you start composing your first letter to an alien, think about this: The chance that those beings evolved on exactly the same time scale is minuscule. Another planet's 100 years of brilliance might have occurred a billion years ago, or it might happen a billion years in the future. A lot depends on how long communication capabilities last. Civilizations that can build huge telescopes and broadcast stations also have the technology to destroy their planet. So the duration of the Communication Age on a planet could be short. Not to mention: The average light-travel-time to such a planet could be tens of thousands of years, so unless humans evolve to be ageless, we're not exchanging IMs with aliens anytime soon. If advanced civilizations can maintain their capabilities for millions of years or more, the chances of communicating with them are not negligible. But in that case, they are likely to be far more sophisticated than we are (since they developed the capability far earlier than we did) -- so if they wanted us to know they exist, wouldn't they simply tell us? The SETI project has been listening for such broadcasts for more than 30 years in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Probably the most likely form of life on exoplanets is far more primitive. Astronomers have found signatures of organic molecules, the building blocks of life, in the interstellar material that permeates the space between stars in our galaxy. Possible signatures of living organisms on distant exoplanets include an oxygen-rich atmosphere, such as that created by the first bacteria on Earth, or perhaps methane or carbon dioxide. NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, to be launched in 2018, will look for evidence of life in the atmospheres of rocky, habitable exoplanets. NASA's rovers have shown that Mars was once much more habitable. It had fresh-water lakes and streams of water running along its surface. Some water still remains, and there may yet be life discovered on Mars. New missions plan to look at Europa and Ganymede, moons of Jupiter that have liquid water below their icy surfaces. Life elsewhere in the universe, and even elsewhere in our own Milky Way galaxy, is practically inevitable. Signs of life on exoplanets orbiting nearby stars will probably be discovered in the coming decades with advanced telescopes. But the chance of talking to those little green men will probably have to wait for another few hundred million years.

Article: Real Madrid winger Gareth Bale will be rested for Saturday's La Liga game at home to Eibar, coach Carlo Ancelotti said on Friday, meaning the Welshman joins suspended midfielders Toni Kroos and James Rodriguez on the sidelines. Ancelotti said he had not made a final decision on who would come into his starting lineup for the game at the Bernabeu, when second-placed Real will look to close the gap on leaders Barcelona, who play at Sevilla later on Saturday, to one point. Asier Illarramendi and Isco will probably play alongside Luka Modric in midfield, with Jese joining Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema up front. Gareth Bale (centre) is being rested by Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti for the Eibar clash. The Real Madrid boss is to give young players Jese and Asier Illarramendi a game on Saturday. 'All I can say is that Illarra and Jese have a very good chance of playing,' Ancelotti told a news conference. Real at least have Ronaldo available after the Spanish soccer federation (RFEF) rescinded a yellow card the Portugal forward was shown in Wednesday's 2-0 win at Rayo Vallecano which would have carried a one-match suspension. Ronaldo is the La Liga's top scorer this season with 37 goals, four ahead of Barcelona's Argentina forward Lionel Messi. Cristiano Ronaldo will play and hopes to add to his already 37 goals in La Liga, the league's highest. Karim Benzema (R) and Alvaro Arbeloa in action during a training session at Valdebebas training ground. Ancelotti said Ronaldo's Portugal team mate Pepe, a centre back, would be available both for Saturday and Tuesday's Champions League quarter-final, first leg at Atletico Madrid after a short injury layoff. Germany midfielder Sami Khedira and Portugal left back Fabio Coentrao have back and knee problems respectively and will not be in the squad for the Eibar game. The modest Basque club are playing in Spain's top flight for the first time this season but a recent poor run has left them in 14th with eight games left, in danger of dropping straight back down to the second division. Pepe (centre) is back in contention for Real's clash with Eibar and Atletico Madrid to play after an injury. 'Our thought is only to play a good match and compete, which is a word we use a lot in our dressing-room,' Eibar coach Gaizka Garitano told Marca sports daily in an interview published on Friday. 'We are not coming with any fear,' added the 39-year-old, who will be keen to avoid a repeat of the 9-1 thrashing Real dealt Granada at the Bernabeu last weekend. 'We defend well,' he said. 'We have lost quite a few games recently but nobody has scored more than two goals against us in those defeats.' Madrid are four points behind rivals Barcelona in the La Liga title race and can't afford to slip-up.

Article: (CNN)It took prosecutors months to present 131 witnesses to support their claim that former NFL star Aaron Hernandez killed semi-pro player Odin Lloyd. On Monday, Hernandez's defense gave its side of the story, wrapping up its witnesses in less than a day. Hernandez, 25, is on trial for the shooting death of Lloyd, whose body was found in a Massachusetts industrial park in June 2013. Now that the defense has rested, it won't be long before the jury begins deliberating. Much of the evidence in the former New England Patriots' case is circumstantial. Here are some key points jurors will have to consider after each side makes closing arguments on Tuesday:. As news spread that Hernandez was under investigation in June 2013, Patriots owner Robert Kraft called in the tight end for a meeting two days after Lloyd's death. "He said he was not involved," Kraft testified last week. "He said he was innocent, and that he hoped that the time of the murder incident came out because he said he was in a club." There's only one potential problem with that claim: The time Lloyd was killed hadn't been made public yet by the time Hernandez met with Kraft. So how could Hernandez have known when Lloyd was killed? "What a great, great witness for the prosecution," CNN legal analyst Mel Robbins said. "Basically what happened is Aaron Hernandez lied to his boss. And the only way you rebut it is if you put him on the stand." When questioned by a defense attorney, Kraft said that he'd never had any problems with Hernandez and that the player was always respectful to him. Hernandez's fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins, revealed for the first time last week that Hernandez told her to dispose of a box from the couple's home that she said reeked of marijuana. She also said she didn't know what was in the box. That revelation may contradict the prosecution's contention that the weapon used in the killing was in the box. The murder weapon in the case has not been recovered. During cross-examination by the defense, Jenkins testified that she suspected marijuana because the box smelled "skunky." Earlier, she told prosecutors during direct examination that she didn't know what was in the box. She said Hernandez never told her, and she never looked. After concealing the box with her daughter's clothing, Jenkins said she threw it away in "a random dumpster" but could not remember exactly where. Much testimony has focused on the shoes Hernandez wore the night Lloyd was shot. A Nike consultant testified that Hernandez was wearing Nike Air Jordan Retro 11 Lows. About 93,000 pairs of that shoe were made, significantly fewer in a size 13. The shoe's sole makes a distinct impression, said Lt. Steven Bennett of the Massachusetts State Police. The consultant testified under questioning from defense attorney Jamie Sultan that other Nike shoes -- more than 3 million -- make the same impression. Yet Bennett, who works in crime scene services, testified that the footprint left near Lloyd's body was "in agreement" or consistent with the Air Jordan Retro 11 Lows size 13. Although he did not have the shoes that Hernandez wore that night, he used an identical pair to make his determination. Bennett did so by creating a transparency of the sole and laying it over a photo of the footwear impression. Jurors watched as he drew lines showing how the sole aligned with the impression. What may have been a key moment for the prosecution was quickly derailed by defense attorney Jamie Sultan. Sultan questioned the science behind analyzing footprints. He introduced a March 2014 investigative report written by Bennett saying the partial footwear impression lacked certain detail and quality to be able to make a comparison. Prosecutors used grainy footage from Hernandez's home security system to suggest he was holding a.45-caliber handgun -- the same kind of gun police said was used to kill Lloyd. Hernandez could be seen on camera pulling into his driveway minutes after Lloyd was shot to death in an industrial park about a mile from Hernandez's home. "In my opinion, the firearm shown in the video stills is a Glock pistol," Glock sales manager Kyle Aspinwall testified. The video is time-stamped minutes after workers in a nearby industrial park describe hearing loud noises like fireworks -- the moment prosecutors say Lloyd was gunned down after getting out of a car Hernandez was driving. Hernandez's lawyers then showed a different part of the video time-stamped a few seconds earlier with Hernandez holding what appeared to be a shiny object in one hand, suggesting it may be an iPad. "Glock pistols don't have white glows to them, do they?" defense attorney James Sultan asked. "No, they do not," Aspinwall answered. Sultan then displayed a soft-pellet gun similar in shape to a Glock, suggesting it could also be the object Hernandez is holding. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty in Lloyd's death. But already, his arrest has led to deep consequences, including his release from the New England Patriots and the loss of millions of dollars in expected earnings. So what might make a young man who had signed a $40 million contract risk everything? Prosecutors have said Lloyd might have done or said something that didn't sit well with Hernandez. They claimed Hernandez rounded up some friends and orchestrated a hit to settle the score. Hernandez's co-defendants, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, also pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. But the case gets more complicated. Evidence collected in Lloyd's death investigation led to two more murder charges against Hernandez in a separate case in Boston. Hernandez is also accused of shooting Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado, allegedly over a spilled drink at a nightclub. That double shooting took place in July 2012, almost a year before Lloyd was killed. Prosecutors have said in pretrial hearings that Hernandez may have been mad at himself for possibly showing Lloyd the spot where that double murder happened. During trial, prosecutors suggest a text written by Hernandez the day before the murder saying he was "buggin" for showing Lloyd "the spot" may have played a role in plotting to kill Lloyd. The judge has banned any mention of the double murder in Lloyd's trial, ruling it is prejudicial. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty in those deaths as well. But when the Lloyd trial ends, that murder trial awaits him. CNN's Jason Hanna, Lawrence Crook, Laura Dolan and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.

The flamboyant Brazilians all played their part in helping the Catalonian side return home with all three points, following Jeremy Mathieu's winning goal. Neymar took to Instagram after his side returned to the summit of La Liga: 'We got home...important victory...Congratulations guys!!! Vamo to top.' Dani Alves (from left), Adriano and Neymar were delighted with their hard-fought victory over Celta Vigo. Dani Alves, who's being linked with a move away from the Nou Camp, also posted a similar picture of the trio. He said: 'A great day at work, a little trairagem in the picture lol Return to home with my brothas @neymarjr @adriano21c. Joy, joy, one is that every day.' Game winner Mathieu admits his side were poor and puts it down to the international break. The three Brazilians all started for Barcelona and played a crucial role in the win which saw them go top. 'Celta played well for the whole 90 minutes, but there are games that are won on little details,' the centre-back told the club's official website. 'It was a tough game.

Article: (CNN)Saturday at the Masters, like any PGA tournament, has been dubbed 'Moving Day'. It's the day after the fat has been cut and the big dogs make their move up -- or occasionally down -- the leader board. Players rose and players fell away on Moving Day at the 2015 Masters. Rory McIlroy went out in 32 and briefly raised the crowd's hopes that he had a sniff of completing an improbable Grand Slam on Sunday night. But he dropped two shots late on in the round to finish six under par. Woods comeback? A rejuvenated Tiger Woods showed touches of his old class mixed with the ragged unpredictability that has marked his new game to finish six under too. A huge improvement, but still a long way from him wearing the green jacket again. "It could have been a super low today," a disappointed Woods said after his round. "All in all. It should have been two shots better." Phil Mickelson powered around the course, threatening to challenge too, finishing on eleven under. As did a late Justin Rose surge, where he fired four birdies in a row to finish twelve under and in second place. In the end, there was lots of moving, but no one could move quick enough or far enough to trouble Jordan Spieth. Infallible. The 21 year old has been nothing short of a sensation at Augusta. His infallible first two rounds gave the 21 year old from Dallas, Texas a five shot lead going in to the third round. That has happened only three times at Augusta before, and on all three occasions the leader has gone on to win. Spieth's 15 birdies are just 10 away from Phil Mickelson's Masters mark set in 2001. He could also break Tiger Woods 270 set in 1997. As it happened, Spieth played a steady, almost conservative round. When he made the occasional mistake, like the bogey at 15, he hit back straight away with a birdie next hole. As his third round came to a close the birdies flowed, his putting impeccable. The only nerves on show came during the last two holes with a double bogey at the 17. Echos of 1996? When reminded of some of the great Augusta comebacks, including Nick Faldo's 11 shot swing in 1996, Tiger Woods still believes anything is possible. "It really is," he said. "We saw what happened in 1996. You never know. It depends on the conditions." He is, of course, right. As Greg Norman knows only too well, anything can happen on the final day. But that kind of crescendo also depends on Spieth experiencing a Greg Norman-style meltdown. Spieth's double bogey on the 17th and wobble on the 18th will give the chasing pack some hope. Yet, for all the movement of Mickelson, Woods, Rose and McIlroy, they made just a one shot dent into Spieth's second round lead. He will begin Sunday four shots ahead.

Article: John Carver admits Newcastle United need to look at the 'DNA' of their dressing-room this summer. The Magpies were beaten for the fifth successive time in Tyne-Wear derbies during Sunday's 1-0 defeat at Sunderland. Head coach Carver says the club's hierarchy have already spoken about addressing their shortcomings during the close-season, and concedes that character is one issue they have to consider. Newcaslte boss John Carver admits the club need to look at the 'DNA' of their dressing-room this summer. Newcastle players train at the club's training complex on Thursday ahead of Monday's clash with Liverpool. Newcastle trio Moussa Sissoko, Vurnon Anita and Massaido Haidara take a breather during training. Ryan Taylor attemps to bend the ball around some dummies and hit the target during Thursday's session. 'There is something in the DNA,' said Carver. 'We've had different managers but the same group of players (keep getting beat). There aren't many Ws (wins) next to their names. 'It's something we need to look at. We struggle when we have to compete. We have talked about addressing that in the summer. 'We are going to invest in the summer so there will be new players around to take us forward.' Newcastle failed to show at the Stadium of Light and Carver later admitted he was 'embarrassed' by the performance. Jermain Defoe (centre) connects beautifully with a left-footed volley to score the winner for Sunderland. Newcastle players look dejected following Sunday's 1-0 defeat to rivals Sunderland at the Stadium of Light. And he added: 'A lot of people in the dressing-room know they didn't perform and didn't do themselves justice. 'I brought them in on Monday when they were meant to be off, I wasn't accepting that. 'Monday was one of my darkest days. It just was not good enough. 'You can do all your preparation you want but it doesn't matter if you don't perform on a Saturday. I don't want training-ground players.' Carver admits he was embarrassed by the performance against Sunderland as Newcastle failed to show. United are nine points clear of the relegation zone and travel to Liverpool on Monday. Carver, though, is taking nothing for granted with regards survival. 'There is only nine points in it,' he said. 'That could be six points if we get nothing at Liverpool. We need points. I'm not interested in how we play, we just need points. 'We have a seven-game season now. These next seven games could define the players. There are a few in there who are out of contract.'

Article: (CNN)A Delaware father is in stable condition and improving as his two boys remain in critical condition after they became sick -- perhaps from pesticide exposure, federal officials say -- during a trip to the U.S. Virgin Islands. Steve Esmond, his teenage sons and the teens' mother fell ill more than two weeks ago in St. John, where they were renting a villa at the Sirenusa resort. The family has confidence in their medical professionals and is hopeful for a full recovery, according to a statement released Monday from the family's attorney, James Maron. The teens' mother, Theresa Devine, was treated at a hospital and released, and is in occupational therapy, Maron said. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Friday that the presence of a pesticide at the rented villa in St. John may have caused the illnesses, which were reported to the EPA on March 20. Paramedics were called to the villa, which the family was renting. Esmond was found unconscious; the boys and their mother were having seizures, Maron said. The lawyer did not say who called the paramedics. Elias Rodriguez, an EPA spokesman, said the agency's preliminary test results "do show that there was a presence of methyl bromide in the unit where the family was staying." Exposure to methyl bromide can result in serious health effects, including central nervous system and respiratory system damage, according to the EPA. The use of the pesticide is restricted in the United States because of its acute toxicity. It's not allowed to be used indoors. Only certified professionals are permitted to use it in certain agricultural settings. For example, the pesticide is injected into the soil of some U.S. strawberry fields, said Judith Enck, an EPA regional administrator. "We trust that the strawberry producers are making sure that there's not excess pesticide residue on strawberries," Enck said. "You definitely want to wash them really good. "This is a pesticide that's been around for a long time, and ironically because of its impact and damage to the ozone layer, it's being phased out because of the air impacts of this fumigant," Enck added. Field workers at a Connecticut nursery were poisoned by the chemical in 1990, according to the Journal of Industrial Medicine. In 2011, warehouse workers in California fell ill after exposed to grapes imported from Chile fumigated with methyl bromide, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, said many parts of the world banned the chemical, a neurotoxin. The agent is to be used only outdoors. The chemical is also odorless and colorless, Gupta said. "It's not something that you would have any warning of," Gupta said. The chemical is often mixed with tear gas so people can be aware of its presence, he added. The EPA said it is working with local government agencies to investigate whether the family was made ill after a fumigation at the resort on March 18 and whether any environmental regulations or laws were violated. Enck, the EPA regional administrator, said paramedics were called early on March 20. Sea Glass Vacations, which acts as a rental agent for several units at Sirenusa, said the unit directly below the one where the family stayed was recently treated for pests, but that the family's unit was not treated. The company said it licensed an outside company, Terminix, for the pest control services. On Monday, it ended its contract with Terminix. In an email to CNN before the termination, a spokesman for Terminix wrote that the company is "committed to performing all work... in a manner that is safe for our customers, employees, the public and the environment" and is "looking into this matter internally, and cooperating with authorities." The U.S. Department of Justice has initiated a criminal investigation. "Many questions remain why an odorless pesticide of this level of toxicity could be manufactured, distributed and applied in a residential area resulting in this family's injuries," Maron said. The attorney added: "The family is confident that the responsible parties will be brought to justice and held accountable." CNN's Rob Frehse, Jean Casarez, Sara Ganim, Jason Hanna, Laura Ly and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.

Article: Gary Caldwell admitted his first taste of management was 'crazy' following Wigan's battling 2-2 draw against Fulham. The Latics may be heading for relegation but they proved they are ready to go down fighting after twice coming from behind to snatch a point at Craven Cottage. Caldwell, at 32 the youngest boss in the league, only replaced the axed Malky Mackay on Wednesday and must have feared the worst when his side conceded after just three minutes to Ross McCormack's strike. Gary Caldwell admitted his first taste of management was 'crazy' following Wigan's battling 2-2 draw. Wigan's Jason Pearce (right) is congratulated by Pennant (left) as he scores the second equaliser for his side. A stylish Jermaine Pennant free-kick hauled Wigan level, only for a stunning long-range effort from Matt Smith put Fulham back in front. But Jason Pearce's 69th-minute effort, when he tucked in a corner at the far post, earned the Latics a point. 'I have just said to the players that I feel very proud of them considering we only had two days to work,' said former Latics skipper Caldwell. 'It's crazy, absolutely crazy. An all-consuming job. But I loved every minute of it and can't wait for the next one. I've had a lot of managers texting me saying 'welcome to the madhouse' and I can see what they mean.' A point lifted Wigan above Millwall, who they face on Tuesday, on goal difference but both teams are seven points adrift of safety. Matt Smith scores Fulham's second goal to restore their lead against Wigan at Carven Cottage on Friday. Smith slides to his knees as he celebrates putting the home side back in front in the Championship match. Caldwell has not been put in charge to perform a miracle, but he still insists there is plenty to play for. 'We'll try to win every game,' he added. 'There's 12 points to play for and we'll try to win every one and see what happens. 'It's going to be a long process to get the club to where we want it to be. But tonight was the way we want to play, that's how this club got success.' Fulham should now be safe, having edged nine points clear of the drop zone, but they were booed off by sections of the home support. Boss Kit Symons' honeymoon period seems to be over, as his decision to take off goalscorer Smith after an hour was met with a chorus of 'you don't know what you're doing'. Fulham captain Scott Parker (right) is hassled for the ball by Wigan's Gaetan Bong (left) at Craven Cottage. The ever industrious Parker (left) dribbles away from the challenge of Wigan's Kim Bo-Kyung (right) 'Matt was shattered,' he explained. 'He's had a lot of football recently and we needed some fresh legs.' Symons has the air of a manager who cannot wait for the season to come to an end. 'It's glass half full, glass half empty,' he added. 'We're a point closer to safety and come the end of the season it might be the point that keeps us in the division. 'It's been a tough season, to put it mildly, and realistically it was probably always going to be like that. When we stay up I certainly won't be doing cartwheels, but I'll breathe a sigh of relief.'

Article: (CNN)Recently, a New York judge issued an opinion authorizing service of divorce papers on a husband completely via Facebook. What exactly is "service of process"? Serving people with legal papers is an industry and its own body of law premised on one guiding principle: if you are going to sue someone, you should at least let them know about it. Sounds simple, right?  In theory it is.  In practice, it turns out people don't like being sued.  It also turns out that, to many defendants, procrastination of a lawsuit is a viable defense. Just as you may avoid bad news in life, defendants tend to avoid process servers.  Once a defendant has been served, that means the judicial proceedings begin.  Unfortunately, that means defendants have an incentive to go "off the grid". Although every state is different, the law of service of process has evolved this way: the ideal and fairest way to notify a person of a lawsuit is to have another human hand the papers to the defendant in person, and have some proof that the person was the defendant. In-person service is not always possible, for obvious reasons.  So, the law had to develop methods of alternate service, but carefully balance a defendant's right to have notice of a lawsuit, against a diligent plaintiff's access to court if a defendant is avoiding the inevitable. As reliable as the U.S. mail is, regular mail is not a reliable form of serving papers.  Not because the postmen can't be trusted; they can. Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night, will keep them from delivering those papers.  Instead, it's defendants -- no wait, all of humanity -- that can't be trusted.  Every one of us has ignored mail or even pretended we didn't get it.  Defendants are no different. One form of alternate service is "nail and mail" service.  This means that you take a hammer and nail, and nail the papers to the defendant's front door.  The problem with that is that many defendants are nomadic by nature.  Just because you find a house that a defendant stayed at, doesn't mean he'll be back there anytime soon. Another, even odder form of "service" is service by publication.  This is an almost laughable legal fiction.  If you can't find a defendant, a judge might let you serve by publication.  That means that a plaintiff can take out an ad in five point font for a week in an obscure publication, on the off chance you are reading the classified ads of the Secaucus Law Journal looking for lawsuits against you.  As laughable as serving someone by tweeting it sounds, it's at least more rational than this antiquated method. At first blush, the idea of service by Facebook seems to offend traditional notions of ensuring notification of a defendant of a case against him.  When it comes to serving papers, however, "traditional" doesn't necessarily mean "good."  Service by publication or nailing paper to the door of an empty apartment is hardly reliable; it's just service of last resort. For those people who are concerned that being served papers will become a Facebook announcement in a news feed, along with the photos of dinner or kittens, to be "liked" by all your gawking "friends," we're not quite there... yet. While the older forms of alternate service were public, most electronic service takes the form of email.  Where email isn't available, it is Facebook private messaging, which should be as private as email.  That's the form of service authorized by the court here.  So for now, we're not quite putting lawsuits on Instagram... but I wouldn't rule it out in the future. Online service may be a new frontier, but it's not unheard of. Most of us exist more online now than we "live" in a particular condo, or Mom's basement. Virtually everyone has a phone or access to the Internet.  Not everyone has a lease or a mortgage.  Plus, online service has the added benefit of tracking.  Believe me, somewhere, some computer has already logged the fact that you read this article, how long you read it, and even how far down you scrolled before you got bored and bailed on the article (thanks for still being here, by the way).  In a way, maybe online service is long overdue.  You can outrun a process server for a while, but sooner or later, all of us have to go back online -- and no human can outrun an email.

Article: Whatever you call them, it's always something of a surprise when a game between the biggest and best teams in any country actually turns out to be a footballing classic. Real Madrid and Barcelona attract viewers, but the cynicism on the pitch can drown out the quality in El Clasico. Borussia Dortmund are not consistently good enough to make Der Klassiker a regular spectacle. English football's closest equivalent, Liverpool taking on Manchester United, is now merely a battle for the top four. But, on Easter Sunday, Marseille and Paris St Germain played out a game that not only had a huge bearing on the Ligue 1 title race, but also easily lived up to it's billing as Le Classique. Paris St Germain players celebrate their win in the dressing room after the game, after twice coming from behind to beat rivals Marseille. Andre-Pierre Gignac gets up above Marquinhos to power home the opening goal for Marseille after half an hour. Blaise Matuidi is congratulated by his team-mates after bringing PSG level with a superb curling effort from the edge of the box. Gignac fires home his second goal past Salvatore Sirigu after a mistake from Marco Veratti gave him a clear run on goal, to make it 2-1. Marquinhos jumps for joy after slamming the ball into the roof of the net to make it 2-2 after Zlatan Ibrahimovic's mis-hit free kick. Ibrahimovic put pressure on Jeremy Morel to force an own goal just two minutes later, as PSG went ahead for the first time in the game. Marseille: Mandanda, Romao, Fanni, Morel, Lemina, Dja Djédjé, Mendy, Payet, Thauvin (Ocampos 63 mins), Gignac (Batshuayi 71), Ayew (Alessandrini 72) Subs not used: Aloe, N'Koulou, Samba, Tuiloma. Goals: Gignac 30, 43. Booked: Romao, Fanni, Ayew, Gignac. PSG: Sirigu, Marquinhos, Thiago Silva, David Luiz (Van der Wiel 34), Maxwell, Verratti, Motta, Matuidi, Pastore (Rabiot 82), Ibrahimovic, Cavani (Lavezzi 59),. Subs not used: Douchez, Cabaye, Bahebeck, Digne. Goals: Matuidi 35 Marquinhos 49, Morel OG 51. Booked: Veratti, Pastore. In the end it was PSG who ran out winners, but they twice had to come from behind to see off their fierce rivals in a game that had passion, quality, and goals aplenty. The game was decided by a 130-second burst soon after the half-time break, in which the visitors came from 2-1 down to go 3-2 ahead, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic, predictably, involved in both goals, though not perhaps, in the way that would be expected. First the Swedish star slipped as he struck a free kick at goal, only to see his nothing effort land at the feet of Brazilian defender Marquinhos, who slammed the ball into the roof of the net from close range. Just two minutes later Ibrahimovic might have been on hand to tap home Javier Pastore's low cross, but in the end his presence was enough to force defender Jeremy Morel to divert it past his own goalkeeper. It felt harsh on Marseille, who were the better side for large periods, but they were let down by defensive frailties and an inability to really punhish the PSG backline. Despite the hosts dominance of possession, the champions could easily have won this by three or four goals, such were their chances. Ibrahimovic had several excellent opportunities, the last of which saw Steve Mandanda pull off a remarkable save, while Pastore should have scored at least once, and Mandanda also did well to deny Matuidi late on. All of that without considering the chances the visitors missed before falling behind in the first half, with Ibrahimovic denied a penalty following a clumsy tackle by Morel, Pastore firing wide when clean through, and the woefully out of form Edinson Cavani scuffing a volley straight at the keeper after being picked out by a beautiful chipped pass. Zlatan Ibrahimovic (left) challenges for the ball against Jeremy Morel in the crucial top of the table clash in Ligue 1 on Easter Sunday. Dimitri Payet gets a shot away under pressure from Marco Veratti of PSG in the Stade Veledrome as Marseille looked to take home advantage. On the other hand it is difficult to remember Salvatore Sirigu making too many meaningful saves in the second half, although he did acrobatically tip a Gignac header over the bar shortly before the break to deny the striker a hat-trick. With Lyon having briefly gone top of the table by beating Guingamp earlier in the weekend, it was a game both sides really needed to win to keep up their title challenges. The result puts Laurent Blanc's men top of Ligue 1 again, and is a serious dent to Marseille's hopes. It all looked so different at half time, when an Andre-Pierre Gignac double had his side 2-1 up. The local-born hero first rose above Marquinhos at the back post to head past Sirigu on the half-hour, before slotting past the Italian shortly before half time to restore the lead. Both goals had an element of fortune, with Gignac climbing all over his defender to convert Dimitri Payet's cross, and Marco Veratti gifting him possession through on goal for the second, but nonetheless he took both well. In between was the pick of the goals, a stunner from Blaise Matuidi, who cut inside beautifully, before curling in from the edge of the box, via the fingertips of Mandanda and the inside of the post. PSG's win was marred only by an injury to David Luiz, withdrawn in the first half with what looked like a hamstring pull. But a win over their fierce rivals, and the return to the table's summit, will soften that blow. David Luiz is brought down, and the Brazilian defender was forced off soon after with a hamstring injury which looked serious. Marseille took the lead twice in the first half, but on both occasions they were unable to stay ahead for too long. Gignac celebrates his second goal, and the Marseille striker was only denied his hat-trick by an acrobatic save from Sirigu. Ibrahimovic looks on unimpressed during a difficult first half for the French champions, but his side kept responding to going behind. Marquihos wheels away after scoring his goal, which made the score 2-2 early in the second half, and changed the momentum of the game. The fiery atmosphere bubbled over late on, as Ezequiel Lavezzi was targeted with missiles and laser pointers while trying to take a corner. The home fans produced a passionate atmosphere in the cauldron of the Veledrome as they pursued the French title against their rivals.

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence.
Andre-Pierre Gignac puts Marseille ahead on half-hour with powerful back-post header from Dimitri Payet cross. Blaise Matuidi equalises five minutes later with a stunning strike from the edge of the box. Gignac capitalises on terrible PSG defending to restore Marseille's lead before half time. Marquinhos brings PSG level again, before Jeremy Morel own goal puts champions ahead moments later.

Article: (CNN)The commissioner-general of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency will make an emergency visit to the Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp in Syria on Saturday, a spokesman says. Commissioner-General Pierre Krähenbühl will assess the humanitarian situation in the camp and speak with individuals about ways to relieve the suffering of the people who remain there. "The visit is prompted by UNRWA's deepening concern for the safety and protection of 18,000 Palestinians and Syrian civilians, including 3,500 children," agency spokesman Christopher Gunness told CNN's Paula Newton.  "Yarmouk  remains under the control of armed groups, and civilian life continues to be threatened by the effects of the conflict." Krähenbühl will meet with senior Syrian officials, U.N. and relief agency staff members, and displaced people from the camp itself. The Yarmouk refugee camp, which sits just 6 miles from central Damascus, has been engulfed in fighting between the Syrian government and armed groups since December 2012. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says the militant group ISIS and the al Qaeda-affiliated Al-Nusra Front control about 90% of the camp.  The organization also claims that the Syrian government has dropped barrel bombs on the camp as recently as Sunday in an effort to drive out armed groups. Yarmouk was formed in 1957 to accommodate people displaced by the Arab-Israeli conflict and is the largest Palestinian refugee camp in Syria. The U.N. relief agency estimates that there were 160,000 people in the camp when the conflict began in 2011 between forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad and opposition fighters. That number has dropped to about 18,000, according to estimates. Yarmouk has been largely cut off from aid since November 2013.  There have been widespread reports of malnutrition and shortages of medical care. "We will not abandon hope," Gunness said.  "We will not submit to pessimism, because to abandon hope would be to abandon the people of Yarmouk. ... We cannot abandon the people of Yarmouk, and we will not, hence this mission."

Article: Tony Pulis has discussed pre-season plans with Saido Berahino in an indication he plans to keep the striker beyond the summer transfer window. Berahino is likely to be away with Gareth Southgate’s England under 21 side in the Czech Republic until late June so Pulis has begun his preparations early. West Bromwich Albion were open to bids of £20million for Berahino in January and the 21-year-old has said he would leave to fulfil his desire to play in Champions League football. West Brom manager Tony Pulis has talked pre-season plans with Saido Berahino in an indication the England under 21 striker will remain at The Hawthorns beyond the summer. Berahino has been linked with a move away from West Brom after saying he wants to play European football. Pulis said: ‘Hopefully he's away with the under 21s so I have had a chat with him about pre-season and the time he'll have off but I haven't spoken about anything else to him. ‘I think the kid is happy here, he has played that way and certainly worked that way. We're more than happy to have him here because he has been very good.’ Berahino shares the same agent as Raheem Sterling, Aidy Ward, who was criticised by Brendan Rodgers over the Liverpool player’s contract stand-off. Pulis said: ‘Agents can have a massive influence on players in lots of respects. My argument to that is in the same in life, you get good agents and you get bad agents. Berahino is likely to be included in the England under 21 squad for this summer's European Championships. Berahino scored a vital goal in England's under 21 play-off with Croatia back in October. 'Professional footballers have been given a gift and they have a lifespan of about 10-12 years. We should never forget that. To be the best is what they should be aiming for. ‘If I had an agent I'd just say, 'Look after the money, make sure when I finish this job I have enough to look after my family'. I wouldn't be talking to my agent about football.’ Pulis added: ‘I can’t speak for Sterling and I can't speak for the agent as I haven't dealt with that but the one thing I have said about Saido, he has been fantastic here. ‘There's been a real change in his attitude, his commitment to everything we've tried to do has been brilliant.’

Pulis has spoken with his striker about pre-season plans. Berahino is expected to be involved with England at under 21 Euros. 21-year-old has made no secret of desire to play in Champions League. Berahino shares same agent as Liverpool winger Raheem Sterling.

Article: London (CNN)It wasn't messrs Clooney, Pitt and their nine accomplices who sailed down an elevator shaft and cracked open dozens of safety deposit boxes at a London vault during the Easter weekend. But last weekend's raid in the heart of the city's jewelry  district feels like it has been taken from a movie like "Ocean 11" given its daring and planning. Such robberies are rare: the gang didn't follow the current criminal trend of manipulating digits in cyber space but instead went back to basics and committed their burglary in a way not seen in London for more than 40 years. In September 1971, the staff of a bank in Baker Street, central London, arrived at work to find that thieves had dug a 40-yard tunnel from a shop they had rented, hauled in a thermic lance and explosives and opened the strong room. The gang got away with a haul worth around £30 million (the incident later formed the basis of the movie "The Bank Job.") But how are such heists organized? Roy Ramm, a former commander of specialist operations at London's Scotland Yard for 27 years, explains. In the UK burglaries and robberies are often committed by working-class people, people who would otherwise have blue collar jobs. In more than 25 years as a Scotland Yard detective, I never met a Raffles- or a Thomas Crown-style criminal from a middle-class background who had then turned to the hard side of crime. Sophisticated heists like the Hatton Garden raid are generally not a natural progression for burglars who began with smaller domestic break-ins. Many neighborhood criminals commit burglaries to feed drugs habits and acquire long strings of convictions that mean they are always on the police radar.  Occasionally, they steal things they can't sell and end up dumping valuable paintings or antiques when they are not able to sell them on quickly. More specialist criminals -- those, for example, who target museums or country houses -- will be very specific and steal only what they know they can quickly convert to untraceable cash. Many of those who commit the bigger crimes or run major criminal enterprises combine high IQs with a kind of raw street intelligence. One of their skills is the ability to recognize a criminal opportunity when it presents itself, possibly from a source of inside information. Probably the biggest difference between any heist you'll see in a movie and its real-life equivalent is the motive. I've never encountered any criminal who committed a high value crime just for the challenge or to prove that it could be done. The only reason has been for the money, often to support a certain lifestyle and to fund other criminal enterprises. Inside information is one way of identifying a criminal opportunity, using people who are able to provide that crucial detail or who will participate in some small way to facilitate the crime. The Brinks MAT robbery in 1983 -- a case which I was involved in at the time -- saw a criminal gang escape with gold bullion worth more than £28 million (around £88 million -- or $130million -- adjusting for inflation) from a warehouse at London's Heathrow Airport. The Knightsbridge safety deposit robbery of 1987 saw a gang make off with tens of millions of pounds in cash and valuables from an upscale London neighbourhood (the true amount will never be known). Both were made possible by inside information: it's an angle that London detectives investigating last weekend's heist will be looking at very closely. The planning behind the Hatton Garden raid will have been meticulous. The target will have been observed, perhaps for months, and the thieves will have decided on the right time to commit the crime.  A long weekend or a public holiday are occasions when more time may be available, also perhaps when regular staff are away. Sometimes the mastermind behind the raid will need a larger team of criminals to do a specific job. Usually they will already be known directly to each other, perhaps because they worked on other jobs together. Possibly a specialist can be brought in by another team member -- but they have to be able to trust each other and trust comes from understanding, so gangs in the UK tend to come from the same social and ethnic group, maybe even limited to one relatively small geographic area. Even though there is more diversity in society, it would be unusual to find a broad ethnic or social mix in the team put together for a major crime. Vehicles will have been obtained, stolen or purchased for cash and their identities cloned or changed. Equipment will have been sourced. Everything will have been cleaned, cleaned and cleaned again to remove forensic traces. They will plan routes that avoid CCTV and timings that attract the least attention. They will have untraceable disposable phones and an outside team to warn the inside men of any problems. They will have planned their getaway, their clean-up and how and when they are going to dispose of anything that might link them to the crime scene -- and of course how they are going to sell on the proceeds of their crime. What criminals steal doesn't vary that much. Cash is probably first choice, followed by anything that can quickly and easily be converted to cash, like gold, jewellery and watches. The conversion of stolen goods to cash is risky and expensive: the Brinks MAT bullion that was traced was because it had been clumsily smelted and then sold on. Fine paintings and rare antiques are less desirable for experienced criminals -- unless they are stealing to order -- because they are so identifiable and because the black market is so much smaller. A painting may sell at an international auction for millions of dollars but it will only fetch a fraction of its true value from a dishonest collector. London detectives investigating the Hatton Garden heist will be looking very closely at the possibility of inside involvement. But police enquiries won't stop there. They will look at every aspect of how the target business operates, then try to think like criminals to identify the weaknesses in physical and operational security that the gang may have been informed about or else spotted and then exploited. The forensic assault on the crime scene will be immense. In recent years forensic science has made major advances in identifying trace evidence and investigators will look for any scrap of evidence that might yield the DNA of a criminal. CCTV footage from street cameras and from inside private premises will be analyzed and vehicle movements logged and cross-checked. Rewards for information will be offered. Witnesses will interviewed. In the police's criminal intelligence branch, the movements of known criminals will be analyzed and the networks of sources -- informers -- will be tasked to report what they hear. The details of any identifiable goods which have been stolen will be circulated to known markets, both in the UK and internationally. The detectives investigating these major crimes in the UK see them as an exciting challenge to their professionalism. They don't admire the criminals but they have less contempt for a gang that builds a sophisticated plan and causes no personal harm to anyone than say for a violent robber. But the investigation will still be relentless.

Article: There looked to be so much bend on Leo Messi’s shot on the half hour at the Nou Camp on Wednesday night that if there had been no net to stop the ball it would kept on curling until it ended up back at the great man’s feet. The Argentine scored his 33rd league goal of the season against Almeria and with Marc Bartra heading in either side of two Luis Suarez goals - the first of which was almost a match for Messi's strike - Barcelona ran out comfortable 4-0 winners. Messi's opener was one of those fantasy football goals that have become so common place they are now being taken for granted. Barcelona star duo Luis Suarez (right) and Lionel Messi embrace as Barcelona take a seven-point lead in La Liga. The Barcelona No 10 loses his markers in the Almeria penalty area before finishing with a trademark curled strike. Barcelona talisman Messi wheels away after opening the scoring  at the Nou Camp during a 4-0 victory over Almeria. Suarez followed Messi's lead by scoring a similar left-footed strike to double the Catalans lead with the first of his two goals. Barcelona defender Marc Bartra stuffs the ball under his shirt after netting a third with a headed goal on 75minutes. Barcelona (4-3-3): Bravo; Alves, Bartra, Mascherano, Adriano; Sergi Roberto, Xavi, Rakitic; Messi, Suarez, Pedro. Subs: Ter Stegen, Montoya, Mathieu, Pique, Iniesta, Rafinha, Neymar. Booked: Mascherano. Scorer: Messi 33', Suarez 55', Bartra 75', Suarez 90' Almeria (4-2-3-1): Julian; Ximo Navarro, Marin, Trujillo, Casado; Partey, Corona; Wellington Silva (Soriano), Espinosa (Mane), Edgar (Zongo); Bifouma. Subs: Ruben, Jurado, Azeez, Hemed. Booke: Casado. Some grumbled that Almeria’s defence could have done more as he ambled in from the right touchline and sent his shot past Julián Cuesta in the visitors’ goal. Other defences might have gone chasing the Barça number 10 and been left on the seats of their shorts, Almeria’s rearguard tried to hold a line just in front of the six-yard box but Messi’s left foot shot whipped past them and bulged the back of Cuesta’s net. Not to be outdone, Suarez first goal of the night was similar drifting in from the right on to a Dani Alves pass and finding Cuesta’s top right-hand corner just as his team-mate had before the break. Defender Bartra added a third and Suarez scored his second with the last kick of the game as Barcelona stayed clear at the top with now just eight matches to play. Suarez deserved his second half goals having been the brightest light for the home side early on. When a Rakitic through-ball put him in he should have scored. Perhaps surprised by the fact that the flag had not been raised his shot was smothered by Cuesta. Almeria were playing their first game under the management of Sergi Barjuan who played over 400 games for Barça and coached in their youth academy when his opposite number Luis Enrique was in charger of the B-team. They almost scored with a Wellington Silva cross-shot that just crept past Claudio Bravo’s far post after Pedro got a touch to it. They were breaking quickly with the pace of former West Brom loanee Thievy Bifouma always a threat. Barcelona responded with Sergio Roberto finding Messi in space on the right but after he accelerated into the area he gave possession away with an uncharacteristically heavy touch. Pedro wrapped a cross-shot just wide of Cuesta’s goal but still there was no breakthrough. It should have come on 24 minutes. Almeria keeper Julian Cuesta uses any means necessary to keep the ball away from former Liverpool forward Luis Suarez (left) Barcelona stalwart Xavi (right) watches on as team-mate Messi tries a rare attempt using his head. Spain international Pedro (centre) was given an opportunity after Neymar was dropped to the bench to cope with hectic schedule. Everyone on the pitch can only watch as Messi's stunning left-foot strike curls into the bottom corner of the net. Brazil full-back Dani Alves rushes to congratulate team-mate Messi after he gives Barcelona a first half lead. The Argentina phenomenon celebrates scoring his 33rd league goal of the season so far. Barcelona were without Neymar, resting on the bench alongside Gerard Pique, but Messi, Suarez and Pedro should have linked to score on 24 minutes. Messi weaved in from the right flank, Suarez got the better of Angel Trujillo and pulled the ball back across the face of the six-yard box but Pedro failed to anticipate the pass and it ran to safety. It looked as if Barcelona would reach half-time without the breakthrough then Messi broke through and Almeria’s resistance was broken for good. Thievy raced away and Mascherano risked a straight red by barging him off the ball as he looked like leaving the Argentine and the covering Sergi Roberto behind. He was shown a yellow and Almeria wasted the free-kick but they offered little going forward after the break. When Suarez scored 10 minutes into the second half only Barcelona’s unwillingness to go up through the gears kept the score down. Bartra headed in goal number three with what was Barcelona’s 14th set-piece goal of the season before Suarez made it four. With set-piece strikes Coach Luis Enrique and his assistant Juan Carlos Unzue have managed to add a new weapon to the Barcelona armoury. If they don’t do you with the magic of Messi and Suarez then they do you from a dead ball. Almeria had succumbed to all three threats. Former France and Barcelona defender Eric Abidal (centre) was at the Nou Camp to watch his old team.

Article: (CNN)Fans of the late actor Paul Walker knew that watching him in "Furious 7" would be bittersweet. Even so, many moviegoers said the final scenes of the new film, which earned a record $146 million over the weekend, still packed an emotional wallop. "Not gonna lie, I shed a few tears at the end of Furious 7. The tribute to Paul Walker was very well done," one woman said Monday on Twitter. Hers was just one of a flood of messages on social media from people who said they got choked up during scenes featuring Walker, who died at 40 in a car crash in November 2013, before filming on "Furious 7" was completed. To finish Walker's scenes, the makers of the movie used body doubles, computer-generated images and even the actor's brothers. But it was the ending that really got to moviegoers. In finishing "Furious 7," the film's producers sought to retire Walker's character, Brian, while paying homage to his role in the blockbuster "Furious" action franchise. But they felt that killing him off might appear exploitative. "If they had gone down the other path, I think I would have refused to finish making this movie," director James Wan told BuzzFeed. Instead, the movie's makers chose to "retire Paul's character in the most sincere and elegant way (they) could," Wan said. Their idea was to have Brian retire from his dangerous, high-octane lifestyle out of a sense of responsibility to his growing family with girlfriend Mia, who is pregnant with their second child. A scene late in the movie shows him and Mia playing on a beach with their son while the crew looks on -- essentially saying goodbye. Then his longtime buddy Dom reminisces about their years together, leading to a montage of Walker scenes from the first six movies. The song that plays over the montage is  "See You Again," a collaboration between Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth. Co-star Vin Diesel shared the video for the song late Sunday on his Facebook page, where it has more than 1.5 million likes. Fans on Twitter and Facebook mostly praised the movie's ending as a fitting tribute -- and an emotionally wrenching one. "Man I don't care how tough u are or how gangsta u claim to be....the last five minutes had me choked up in the movie theater... I saw it 3 times in one day......the ending is the deepest ending I've ever seen," one man wrote on the movie's Facebook page.

Article: Tim Visser wants to end his Edinburgh career lifting European silverware at the ground he will call home next season. The final of the European Challenge Cup is now tantalisingly within reach for Alan Solomons’ side after their heroic quarter-final triumph over London Irish. Only Newport Gwent Dragons stand in their way in what will be a tough semi-final at BT Murrayfield in a fortnight. Should the Scots prevail, they will head for Twickenham Stoop - home of Harlequins for whom winger Visser signed a two-year deal this month. Tim Visser was a key player in Edinburgh's dramatic win over London Irish at the Madejski Stadium. ‘The Stoop is going to be my future home ground and it would be great to get to know it by playing a final there,’ he said. ‘For that to be one of my final games for Edinburgh and to pick up silverware would make things pretty special, really emotional and a great end to my time at the club. ‘Helping Edinburgh bring the first major trophy back home would be the perfect way to give back something to the club, to repay them for all they have done through the years, all the good friends I have made, all the good memories.’ Scotland cap Visser was one of Edinburgh’s key men in the dramatic win at the Madejski Stadium. He played a crucial role in a mighty rearguard action when he joined the scrum as a flanker following the sin-binning of prop John Andress. VIsser is hopeful he can end his Edinburgh career at the ground he will call home from next season. And it is the strength of character shown in those closing minutes that has convinced him the season will end with silverware and a top-six spot in the Pro12. ‘That was an unbelievable win and you can’t under-estimate its significance,’ he said. ‘I was at the scrum in the end and the way Dicko (Alasdair Dickinson) held up their player when he went over the line in that final minute showed the desire we had to come away with a win. ‘The way we defended in those final moments shows the fight of the boys to get underneath the ball at the end and keep them out. Edinburgh will have to see off Newport Gwent Dragons if they are to reach the final at the Stoop. ‘The Edinburgh of old would have probably let that through and we would have lost. ‘We work hard for each other. That is exactly what you saw at the end of the game. Our aim is to finish in the top six and to lift the European Challenge Cup. Both are definitely on.’

Tim Visser has agreed to join Harlequins next season. Edinburgh one win away from European Challenge Cup final at the Stoop. And Visser wants to crown his time with the club before he leaves.

Article: (CNN)Tejano star Selena, who died 20 years ago, is coming back in a big way: with a hologram-like figure. Billboard reports that the singer's family is creating a version of the singer that will be "walking, talking, singing and dancing digital embodiment" of her persona. "By no means is this something that's creepy or weird," her sister, Suzette Quintanilla, told Billboard. "We think it's something amazing. A lot of the new fans that did not get to experience what Selena was about hopefully will be able to get a sense of her with this new technology that's going to be coming out." Selena: 20 years after her death. The technology is being handled by Acrovirt LLC, a Nevada-based tech company. "Using detailed individual personalized functions spanning the mind, brain and body, the individual's Digitized Human Essence will autonomously learn and react on behalf of its human counterpart's," the company explained. The project is being called "Selena the One." Twenty years after she was killed by her fan club president, Selena remains incredibly popular, with her Facebook page recording 2 million likes and fans continuing to post videos and tributes. Selena will be the first figure to use the Acrovirt technology, Quintanilla said. "I'm excited at the fact that she will be the first ever, and the fact that she's a Latina makes it even more awesome," she said. "It's not about replacing Selena in any shape, way or form; it's just something to help her legacy continue growing." The family intends to expand her legacy in another way: with some new music. Selena the One "will release new songs and videos, will collaborate with current hit artists, and aims to go on tour in 2018," said a statement on Selena's Facebook page. Selena isn't the first performer to try the virtual route. A Michael Jackson hologram appeared at the Billboard Music Awards in 2014, and a hologram of Tupac Shakur performed at Coachella in 2012. But the new technology is a step forward, Quintanilla said. "People don't realize how fast technology is moving," she told Billboard. "This is something that we're building for another two to three years, so when 2018 comes around they'll be like, 'Oh, OK, we get it.' " Fans can join an Indiegogo campaign, www.selenatheone.com, to support the launch. The campaign, which hopes to raise $500,000, begins April 16. The commemorative Fiesta de la Flor in Corpus Christi, Texas -- which celebrates her life -- is scheduled for April 17 and 18. CNN's Katia Hetter contributed to this story.

Article: (CNN)A judge this week sentenced a former TSA agent to six months in jail for secretly videotaping a female co-worker while she was in the bathroom, prosecutors said. During the investigation, detectives with the Metro Nashville Police Department in Tennessee also found that the agent, 33-year-old Daniel Boykin, entered the woman's home multiple times, where he took videos, photos and other data. Police found more than 90 videos and 1,500 photos of the victim on Boykin's phone and computer. The victim filed a complaint after seeing images of herself on his phone last year. Boykin plead guilty to unlawful photography, aggravated burglary and violation of the computer act, the Nashville District Attorney's Office said. Police said the incident happened in a TSA-only restroom, and that there was no evidence public restrooms were targeted. A TSA official tells CNN that Boykin worked in an administrative capacity and didn't engage in public security screening. Assistant District Attorney Amy Hunter said this case was one of the worst invasion of privacy cases she's seen. "We are thankful that the sentence includes periodic confinement so that the sentence will hopefully make an impression on this defendant and others," Hunter said in a statement. The judge, Randall Wyatt, on Friday called the invasion of privacy "egregious." His sentence also includes five and a half years of probation, which will include GPS monitoring. Boykin was terminated last year when the investigation began.

Article: (CNN)Five young Chinese feminists, whose detention has provoked an international outcry, may face up to five years in prison over their campaign for gender equality. The women were among detained on March 6 and March 7 in three Chinese cities -- Beijing, Guangzhou and Hangzhou -- shortly before events they had planned for International Women's Day on March 8. Wang Qiushi, the lawyer for one of the women, Wei Tingting, said police had recommended on April 6 that prosecutors press charges of "assembling a crowd to disturb public order." Wang told CNN that prosecutors had to decide whether to pursue the charges within seven days of the submission -- by Monday. "We hope that the prosecutors will not approve a formal arrest warrant, following the laws and standing up to pressure," he said. "But nobody knows what to expect till Monday; we can do nothing but wait." The five were initially held on suspicion of "picking quarrels and provoking trouble." Wang said he didn't know why the charge against the women changed. "Neither should constitute a crime," he said. Campaign group Amnesty International said the new charge was less serious but still carried a maximum jail term of five years. "The women were doing nothing wrong, nothing illegal. They were simply calling for an end to sexual harassment," William Nee, China researcher at Amnesty International told CNN. "Everything they were doing was in line with China's own laws and policies." Wang said that Wei had been subject to lengthy cross examinations during her detention but was well the last time they met on March 31. Two of the women are said to be in poor health. He added that the charges relate both to the activities the women planned for International Women's Day and earlier campaigns against domestic violence and for more public toilets for women. The five -- who are members of China's Women's Rights Action Group -- had planned to hand out stickers printed with slogans saying "stop sexual harassment, let us stay safe" and "go police, go arrest those who committed sexual harassment!" on women's day. The detention of Wei, along with Wu Rongrong, Li Tingting, Wang Man and Zheng Churan has drawn harsh criticism from the international community. Protests have taken place in several cities, including Hong Kong, that urge Chinese officials to "free the five." A social media campaign also uses the phrase as a hashtag. On Monday, Hillary Clinton, former U.S. secretary of state, tweeted that the activists' detention was "inexcusable." Her comment drew a rebuke from Chinese authorities, who said public figures should respect China's sovereignty and independence. Maya Wang, China researcher at Human Rights Watch, said the activists were best known for their "performance art" style protests -- occupying public toilets to highlight long lines at women's restrooms, donning blood-spattered wedding gowns to protest domestic violence and shaving their heads to protest against barriers to higher education for women. "These activists epitomize the spirit of the times. They are young, confident, ready to challenge established norms," Wang said. As China prepares to mark the anniversary of landmark UN Fourth World Conference on Women in September, it will be hard for authorities to justify detaining the activists, she added.

Article: Rangers boss Stuart McCall  ordered his side to end their stuttering away form at Dumbarton on Saturday to ramp up the pressure on play-off rivals Hibs. The Ibrox boss watched his side drop two points against bottom side Livingston in West Lothian but insisted the 1-1 draw — with Myles Hippolyte and Marius Zaliukas trading goals — could end up being crucial in the quest to finish second. Rangers have only won once in their last five away matches and McCall insists nothing less than a victory will do at the Bet Butler Stadium this weekend as his side aim to go four clear in second while Hibs face Falkirk in the Scottish Cup semi finals. Stuart McCall wants his side to put their away-day blues behind them at Dumbarton on Saturday. ‘We could be four ahead on Saturday night so that might be a very important point for us tonight,’ said McCall on a night when Rangers fans let off a series of fireworks in the Energy Assets Arena. ‘It’s still in our hands — but we have got to go and win on Saturday! ‘Of course I’m disappointed not to win the game. We didn’t deserve any more but this wasn’t a case of us blowing hot and cold. We’ve no divine right to come here and win. ‘I said before the game this would be a tough place to come. OK, we didn’t play as fluently as we would have liked but Livvy were fighting for their lives. They are a physical side and Hibs and Queen of the South have still to come here. Rangers dropped two points at Championship bottom side Livingston in their bid for promotion. Myles Hippolyte gave Livingston the lead early in the second half and threatened to upset Rangers. ‘It was a game that panned out the way I expected on a tight park, dry and bumpy. It was a fair result. You can’t stop a free kick like that (by Hippolyte).’ Meanwhile, Mark Burchill was left ruing a first half ‘goal’ by Hippolyte that was chalked off after a supposed foul by Jordan White on Cammy Bell. But the Livvy boss was also left lamenting his team’s dire defending 120 seconds after taking the lead through Hippolyte’s fine freekick. ‘I think everyone here knows it should have been a goal by Myles in the first half,’ he sighed. Marius Zaliukas equalised a couple of minutes later for Rangers at the Energy Assets Arena. ‘I’m just really disappointed. It was a terrible goal for us to lose. If you go ahead in a match you really want to do better than that. When you’ve taken the lead that’s your most vulnerable time as a team. And I just feel if we had weathered that then Rangers would have run out of ideas. ‘It was not the best we have played but I felt we more than matched Rangers tonight. I watched them on Sunday against Raith and I thought we could get three points from them and I’m disappointed we never managed to do that.’

Rangers held to a 1-1 draw by bottom side Livingston on Wednesday. The draw means Rangers have won just one of  last five away matches. The point was still enough for Rangers to move second above Hibs. Rangers face Dumbarton away from home on Saturday.

Article: (CNN)Those poor fish must have been wondering what the heck was happening to them. The Oregon Parks and Recreation Department has reported that a section of a fiberglass boat 20 or 30 feet long was spotted off the state's coast this week and has been towed into harbor. The debris is suspected to be from the earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan on March 11, 2011. The boat fragment was found this week and towed to Newport, Oregon, where it is moored at a marina. Inside were found -- more than four years and 4,000 miles later, if officials' suspicions are correct -- some specimens of a variety of yellowtail jack fish normally found in Japanese waters. Biologists with the Oregon Coast Aquarium and Oregon State University's Hatfield Marine Science Center inspected the debris while it was still at sea and determined that the ecological threat posed by invasive species was small. The remnants of the boat will be dried out, inspected further and taken to a landfill. But for the yellowtail jack fish, the journey is not over. They'll be taken to the Oregon Coast Aquarium.

Jeff Teague added had 17 points as Atlanta never trailed while ending the Nets' season-best six-game winning streak. Bojan Bogdanovic led Brooklyn with 19 points. The Hawks topped their previous season high of 130 points on John Jenkins' 3-pointer with 54 seconds remaining. Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer has given his starters generous rest since the team clinched first place in the Eastern Conference playoffs. The Hawks returned to a normal rotation against the Nets and looked ready for the postseason while racing to a 66-48 halftime lead. The teams could meet in the playoffs, but Budenholzer said before the game 'We can't hold anything back. We're just going to play.' Paul Millsap left the game early after picking up a shoulder injury in the first half. Millsap's injury was the only bad news of the first half for the Hawks. Atlanta shot 7 for 12 on 3-pointers in the half and also had stirring jams from Horford and Teague. Reggie Jackson scored 15 of his 29 points in the fourth quarter, including the winning layup with 5 seconds remaining, and the Detroit Pistons rallied to beat the Miami Heat 99-98. Andre Drummond had 11 points and 17 rebounds for his 44th double-double, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope scored 19 points and Anthony Tolliver added 15 for the Pistons. Detroit rallied from 15 down in the fourth and closed with a 21-6 run over the final 5:36 to get the win. Dwyane Wade scored 24 points and Goran Dragic had 21 for the Heat. Luol Deng added 13 points and Hassan Whiteside had 13 points and 12 rebounds. The Western Conference leading Golden State Warriors beat the Dallas Mavericks in Texas. Marcus Smart celebrates his winning basket as the Boston Celtics beat the Toronto Raptors in overtime. Marcus Smart hit a buzzer-beating layup in overtime and the Boston Celtics beat the Toronto Raptors 117-166 and moved into the playoff berths. With 2.6 seconds left and Boston trailing by one, Smart took a pass from a driving Isaiah Thomas and sneaked behind the collapsing Toronto defense to score the winning basket, silencing the sellout crowd of 19,800. Thomas scored 25 points, Tyler Zeller had 20 and Evan Turner added 18 points and 10 assists for the Celtics, who moved one-half game ahead of Miami in the race for the final Eastern Conference playoff berth after the Heat's loss at Detroit. Klay Thompson scored 21 points and the Golden State Warriors clinched home-court advantage throughout the playoffs with their 12th straight victory, beating the Dallas Mavericks 123-110. The Los Angeles Clippers were far too strong for the Denver Nuggets in a 107-92 victory. The Warriors (63-13) need one more victory to assure finishing with the best record in the NBA for the first time since 1975-76. They hold the tiebreaker on Atlanta for the top overall seed. Stephen Curry scored 11 points while big men Andre Iguodala and Maurice Speights got into the long-range fun mostly reserved for Splash Brothers Curry and Thompson. Both finished with 18 points. Dirk Nowitzki had 18 points to lead the Mavericks. Also Saturday, the Los Angeles Clippers had a 107-92 win over the Denver Nuggets, the Orlando Magic beat the Milwaukee Bucks 97-90, the Charlotte Hornets edged the Philadelphia 76ers 92-91 and the Washington Wizards topped the Memphis Grizzlies 92-83.

Article: (CNN)Two Alabama college students are accused of gang raping a woman while on spring break at Florida's Panama City Beach. Ryan Calhoun and Delonte Martistee, students at Troy University, were arrested and charged with sexual battery by multiple perpetrators, according to a statement from the Bay County, Florida, Sheriff's Office. The Troy, Alabama, Police Department found video of what appeared to be a Panama City gang rape during the course of an investigation into an unrelated shooting. The video was turned over to the Bay County Sheriff's Office. The Bay County Sheriff's Office Criminal Investigations Division has identified the victim in the video but said state law prevents the office from releasing any information about her. She was a visitor in Panama City. "We are not releasing her location or any additional information on victim to protect her from further trauma," said sheriff's spokesman Tommy Ford. After interviewing witnesses, Bay County investigators determined the alleged rape took place sometime from March 10, 2015, to March 12, 2015, behind Spinnaker Beach Club, a popular bar and dance club for spring breakers. A statement from Troy University confirmed the two men are current students. "The students have been placed on temporary suspension from school per the university's standards of conduct and disciplinary procedures. Martistee, a member of the track and field team, has also been removed from the team." The investigation continues and more arrests are expected, the Bay County Sheriff's Office said. Calhoun and Martistee will have their first court appearance Saturday morning, a Bay County deputy said. CNN could not determine if the men have attorneys.

Article: British No 2 Aljaz Bedene has booked a quarter-final place at the Grand Prix Hassan II event in Casablanca. The world No 99, who switched allegiance from Slovenia to Britain last month, knocked out fellow qualifier Arthur De Greef, of Belgium, 6-2, 6-3 in just 70 minutes. London-based Bedene, 25, will now face third seed Jiri Vesely, who was given a far tougher test as he progressed to the last-eight. British number two Aljaz Bedene, pictured in June 2013, defeated Arthur De Greef in just 70 minutes. Bedene represents Great Britain after switching allegiance from Slovenia in March. Czech Vesely claimed his first victory of the year on clay, but only after saving a set-point against former world top-10 player Mikhail Youzhny to progress 7-6 (9/7), 6-3. Top seed and defending champion Guillermo Garcia-Lopez, though, suffered a surprise defeat, bowing out 6-3, 6-3 against Morocco's world number 313 and wild card entry Lamine Ouahab. Ouahab next faces Spaniard Daniel Gimeno-Traver, who held a 6-1, 4-1 lead against seventh seed Mikhail Kukushkin, before he was forced to retire.

Article: Irbil, Iraq (CNN)ISIS claimed it controlled part of Iraq's largest oil refinery Sunday, posting images online that purported to show the storming of the facility, fierce clashes and plumes of smoke rising above the contested site. The group said it launched an assault on the Baiji oil refinery late Saturday. By Sunday, ISIS said its fighters were inside the refinery and controlled several buildings, but Iraqi government security officials denied that claim and insisted Iraqi forces remain in full control. CNN couldn't independently verify ISIS' claim. It wouldn't be the first time that militants and Iraqi forces have battled over the refinery, a key strategic resource that has long been a lucrative target because the facility refines much of the fuel used by Iraqis domestically. If an attack damaged oil fields or machinery, it could have a significant impact. The refinery is just 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the northern Iraqi city of Tikrit, which Iraqi forces and Shiite militias wrested from ISIS less than two weeks ago. CNN's Jennifer Deaton and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.

Article: Everton defender John Stones was the shock name on Barcelona’s shopping list of central defenders last summer. Barcelona ended up signing 31-year-old Jeremy Mathieu from Valencia for £14.5m and 29-year-old Thomas Vermaelen from Arsenal for £15m but influential voices at the Catalan club urged then sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta to bid for 20-year-old Stones instead. According to El Pais, Barcelona were desperate for defensive reinforcements at the end of last season. The former Barnsley defender  moved himself up the list of possible targets with performances for Everton that saw the youngster on the stand-by list for England’s World Cup campaign in Brazil. Everton defender John Stones was on Barcelona's list of defensive transfer targets last summer. Barcelona were desperate for reinforcements and Stones' performances  caught the eye of the Catalans. His ability to play at right-back as well as centre-back played in his favour with the club preparing for the likely departure of Dani Alves currently in the final year of his contract and Barcelona's preference for central defenders with the mobility and technique to play at full-back. In the end Barcelona coach Luis Enrique insisted on the signing of Mathieu – another who can also fill-in at full-back - and Stones signed a new £30,000-a-week five-year deal keeping him at Everton until 2019. The contract was seen as a rebuff to Chelsea who were following Stones but it now also seems to have been in response to interest from La Liga leaders Barcelona. Stones signed a new £30,000-a-week five year deal keeping him at Everton until 2019. French defender Mathieu has been a success at the Camp Nou but Vermaelen is yet to start a game for Barcelona. The Belgian arrived with a hamstring injury sustained at the World Cup and never played more than a friendly against an Indonesian XI before having an operation in Finland in December to remedy the problem. He is now training with team-mates but still some way off match fitness and while he could be available for the last month of the season Barcelona have no margin of error in the league and he may have to wait until next season to make his first start. With Vermaelen struggling to regain fitness and both Mathieu and Javier Mascherano having reached 30, Barcelona – who cannot sign anyone until January 2016 because of a Fifa ban – have not forgotten about Stones, who turns 21 at the end of May. Barcelona ended up signing Valencia defender Jeremy Mathieu who netted against Celta Vigo on Sunday. Thomas Vermaelen also moved to the Nou Camp from Arsenal but is yet to start a game for Barcelona.

Article: Havana, Cuba (CNN)All eyes are going to be on the new kid finally allowed to play and the big kid who for so long wanted nothing to do with him -- Cuba and the United States in the same diplomatic playground. Cuba pulled off a diplomatic coup by marshaling the support of other regional countries to insist on their attendance at the Summit of the Americas. And for the first time since 1962, the U.S. has not blocked Cuba's attempt to join. Now it's time to see how they play and who they play with -- especially Venezuela, which often falls out with Washington for crushing dissent at home and supplying Havana with billions of dollars in oil. Cuba is trying to re-establish itself at the two-day summit in Panama, arriving with more than 100 government officials, diplomats, small business people and artists. But Cuba's attempts to rebrand itself as an open, diverse society stumbled Wednesday when government supporters and anti-Castro supporters brawled in the streets of Panama. Video of the incident showed Cuban government officials exchanging punches and insults with dissidents until Panamanian police in riot gear broke up the melee. With the historic thawing in relations between the U.S. and Cuba, Washington now has urgent business to discuss with Havana. "We have really big issues with the Cubans that do need to be solved," said Ambassador Vicki Huddleston, who served as the chief of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana. She added "The Cubans are typical of their negotiating style. You think it's going to be easy because we have said 'We are going to have good relations with you' and they say, 'That's not exciting for us and it is for you.' So they are hard negotiators as they always have been." The forum could provide the opportunity to push forward an agreement to re-establish formal relations and re-open embassies after nearly four months of negotiations. While President Barack Obama is not scheduled to meet Cuban leader Raul Castro, U.S. officials said there will be opportunities for "interaction" between the two leaders. The first time the two heads of state met was in 2013 at Nelson Mandela's funeral. Their brief handshake captured the world's attention and lit up social media. Few people then knew that the two countries were secretly involved in negotiations to thaw five decades of deadlocked Cold War-era relations. Obama had said he had hoped a U.S. Embassy would reopen in Havana before the summit, but Cuban officials have said they cannot imagine a full restoration of diplomatic ties until Cuba is removed from the U.S. State Department list of countries that support terrorism. "It would be difficult to explain that diplomatic relations have been resumed while Cuba has been unjustly listed as a state sponsor of international terrorism," said Josefina Vidal, the general director of U.S. affairs at the Cuban Foreign Ministry and lead negotiator in the talks. Cuba was added to the list in 1982, which includes Syria, Iran and Sudan. The designation carries financial sanctions which Cuban officials say further damages their already ailing economy. The State Department has sent a recommendation to the White House that Cuba be removed, paving the way for the White House to announce its intent to de-list Cuba as early as this week, two administration officials told CNN. Removal from the list "does not relate to whether or not we agree with everything a country does or whether we agree with its political system, or its foreign policy," Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said on a conference call with reporters Tuesday. "It's a very practical review as to whether or not a government is sponsoring terrorism." Rhodes also dialed backed rhetoric on Venezuela, saying the country did not pose a national security threat to the United States, despite a recent declaration to that effect. The designation was meant to allow officials to target seven allegedly corrupt Venezuelan officials, but it ignited a firestorm, particularly in Cuba, which has close ties to Venezuela. Deceased Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez was a friend and admirer of former Cuban leader Fidel Castro. Chavez's successor Nicolas Maduro continues to send Cuba tens of thousands of barrels of oil each day, despite his country's own economic turmoil. In exchange, Cuba sends doctors, military advisers and sports trainers to Venezuela. In Cuba's state-run media, criticism of U.S. policy towards Venezuela has overshadowed the improvement in U.S.-Cuba relations. In March, Fidel Castro published a letter criticizing the U.S.' "brutal plans towards" Venezuela and the Cuban government promised "unconditional aid" to help defend against American threats. Its remains to be seen how much Cuba will risk its warming relations with the United States to back up ally Venezuela. But apparently there is little doubt among the Cuban people on what their government should do. A poll of 1,200 Cubans released on Wednesday found that 97% of the people surveyed by Miami-based polling firm Bendixen & Amandi on behalf of The Washington Post and Univision Noticias/Fusion supported improved U.S.-Cuban relations.

Article: Chelsea's Eden Hazard and Arsenal's Santi Cazorla are set to reach a Premier League milestone this weekend when they each make their 100th appearance. Both players have been hugely influential since they moved to London in the summer of 2012, but who has been the most exciting import to watch? Here, Sportsmail's reporters choose the player they most enjoy seeing in action. Eden Hazard (L) and Santi Cazorla are both set to make their 100th Premier League appearance this weekend. Lee Clayton. Cazorla has wonderful balance. So does Hazard. Cazorla scores important goals. So does Hazard. Cazorla is two-footed. So is Hazard. Cazorla dances past opponents. So does Hazard. So, while there is not a lot to choose between them and Hazard is likely to get the most picks in this article, I am going for Cazorla. It's a personal choice. He is a wonderful footballer. I have paid to watch them both (and I will pay to watch them both again), but the little Spanish magician edges it for me. VERDICT: CAZORLA. Cazorla, pictured in action against Burnley, has been an influential part of Arsenal's midfield this season. Ian Ladyman. I remember when Manchester City baulked at paying Hazard's wages when the Belgian was up for grabs in 2012. Back then City thought the young forward had a rather high opinion of his own worth for a player who was yet to play in a major European league. In the early days of his time at Chelsea, it looked as though City may have been right. He showed flashes of brilliance but also looked rather too easy to push off the ball. Roll forward to 2015, however, and the 24-year-old has developed in to one of the most important players in the Barclays Premier League. Brave, strong and ambitious, Hazard plays on the front foot and with only one thought in this mind. Rather like Cristiano Ronaldo, he has also developed in to the type of player ever defender hates, simply because he gets back up every time he is knocked to the ground. He would get in every team in the Premier League and is one of the reasons Chelsea will win the title this season. VERDICT: HAZARD. Hazard controls the ball under pressure from Stoke midfielder Stephen Ireland at Stamford Bridge. Dominic King. It has to be Hazard. I saw him play for Lille twice in the season before he joined Chelsea – once against St Etienne, the other was what proved to be his final appearance against Nancy. He scored two in the first match, a hat-trick the latter and played a different game to those around him. He hasn't disappointed since arriving here and I love the nonchalance with which he takes a penalty, his low centre of gravity and the way he can bamboozle defenders. If there is such a thing as £32million bargain, it is Hazard. VERDICT: HAZARD. Hazard celebrates after scoring a fine individual goal in Chelsea's 3-2 win against Hull in March. Nick Harris. Now this is a tricky one because while Eden Hazard will frequently embark on a dribble or dink in a pass that will make you nod in appreciation, he'll also miss a penalty and make you groan. Whereas the older Cazorla, less flashy but no less of a technical master, is to my mind more of a fulcrum, more important relatively to the sum of Arsenal's parts than Hazard is to Chelsea. You'll gasp at Hazard but Cazorla's wow factor is richer. That's not to dismiss either: both are brilliant footballers, contributing goals, assists and flair. Any neutral would bite your hand off to have either playing in your team. Forced to pick though, it's Cazorla, for his consistency and crucially doing it in the biggest games. Exhibit A would be Manchester City 0 Arsenal 2 in January; goal, assist, all-round brilliance, against a big team, at an important time. VERDICT: CAZORLA. Cazorla scores from the penalty spot in Arsena's 2-0 away win at Manchester City in January. Riath Al-Samarrai. Eden Hazard for me. Cazorla is an utter delight, a little pinball of a man who is probably the most two-footed player I've seen. Put him in a tight space and then you see what makes him rare among the best. But Hazard is the top player in the Premier League, in my opinion. This is the sixth of his eight seasons as a professional where he has reached double figures and yet he offers so much more than goals (36 in 99 in the Premier League for Chelsea). He can beat a man and, better still, you sense he likes doing it. Technically, his passing and shooting are excellent and he also has a mind capable of sussing out the shapes and systems in front of him. That intelligence, more specifically his speed of thought, is probably what makes separates the good from the brilliant. A complete player who doesn't yet seem to have the complete ego. VERDICT: HAZARD. Hazard gets away from Manchester City duo Fernando (left) and Martin Demichelis at Stamford Bridge. Laurie Whitwell. Has to be Hazard for me. The way he carries the ball through ever tightening spaces and emerges the other side is a joy. Like one of those Indiana Jones impossible escapes from a sliding door or rolling boulder. And his penalties are mesmeric. I could watch them again and again not working out how he does it. VERDICT: HAZARD. Belgium international Hazard scores a header past West Ham goalkeeper Adrian at Upton Park. Sami Mokbel. Both are marvellous players, but I could watch Santi Cazorla all day. When he first arrived in England I remember, whilst sitting in the Upton Park press box, trying to work out whether he was left or right footed. He was wonderful that day as Arsenal cruised to a 3-1 win; it was one of the most complete performances I've seen live. In truth, I've still got no idea whether he's left or right footed. He's that natural on either. Hazard is a phenomenon, but aesthetically no on can touch Cazorla in the Premier League. VERDICT: CAZORLA. Cazorla grins after scoring Arsenal's fourth goal against Aston Villa at the Emirates in February. Jack Gaughan. From a purely artistic sense, Santi Cazorla is probably the most graceful individual on the ball in the entire Premier League. But Eden Hazard provides moments to really stick in the memory. He glides past opponents effortlessly and regularly chips in with important goals - plenty of them stunning in their execution. Worth the ticket alone. The one blot from Cazorla's point of view is that his genius can be fleeting. VERDICT: HAZARD. Sam Cunningham. Jose Mourinho has told him to add more goals to his game to move on a par with Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo and, three years younger than the Argentine and six than the Portuguese, he is not far from doing that. I've watched Hazard countless times at Stamford Bridge this season and he makes the game seem like an art form with his movement, dribbling and passing. Cazorla can excite at times, but he is nowhere near consistently reaching Hazard's level. For me there is no contest between the pair. VERDICT: HAZARD. Hazard tucks home yet another penalty during Chelsea 2-1 win against Stoke City last weekend. Craig Hope. I would far rather have Hazard in my team, but I can't help but feel the excitement has been stripped from him under Jose Mourinho. Efficient, technically brilliant, effective and hard-working he most certainly is - and he will be crowned PFA Player of the Year - but he is no longer the daring dribbler of whom we heard so much about during his teenage years in France. He is, though, arguably a better player for Mourinho's influence. Cazorla, meanwhile, would never thrive under Mourinho, there is too much of Juan Mata about him. But there is no doubt he is thrilling to watch on his day - it's just a shame those days aren't as frequent as they should be for a player of his calibre. VERDICT: HAZARD. RESULT: HAZARD 7-3 CAZORLA. Hazard has been voted as a more exciting player than Cazorla in Sportsmail's survey.

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence.
Chelsea star Eden Hazard is set to make his 100th top-flight appearance. Santi Cazorla should hit the same milestone when Arsenal meet Burnley. Both players have impressed since moving to the Premier League in 2012. Hazard has more goals this season but Cazorla has one more assist. Sportsmail's reporters choose the player who has excited them the most.

Article: (CNN)Getting caught napping on the job is never good.  Getting caught napping on the job in the cargo hold of a plane takes it to a whole different level. Alaska Airlines Flight 448 was just barely on its way to Los Angeles from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on Monday afternoon when the pilot reported hearing unusual banging from the cargo hold. "There could be a person in there so we're going to come back around," he told air traffic control. The banging in the cargo hold did come from a person and he turned out to be a ramp agent from Menzies Aviation, a contractor for Alaska Airlines that handles loading the luggage, the airline said.  The man told authorities he had fallen asleep. It appears he was never in any danger. The cargo hold is pressurized and temperature controlled, the airline said. The plane was also only in the air for 14 minutes. The passengers knew something wasn't right, almost as soon as the plane took off. "All of a sudden we heard all this pounding underneath the plane and we thought there was something wrong with the landing gear," Robert Higgins told CNN affiliate KABC. The pounding grew louder. "At that point, we started hearing yelling, screams for help, very, very faint," Jamie Davis said.  "That's when we notified the flight attendant that there was somebody underneath us." As the banging continued, a federal air marshal sprang into action. "At some point, the marshal kind of made himself known," said Troi Ge.  "He started banging back, and he yelled really loud and said, 'We're getting ready to land, hold on to something.'" The emergency landing spooked the folks aboard Flight 448. Affiliate KOMO spoke to Marty Collins, another one of the passengers. "We just took off for L.A. regular and then... about five minutes into the flight the captain came on and said we were going back and we'd land within five to seven minutes, and we did," Collins said. "When we landed was when all the trucks and the police and the fire trucks surrounded the plane." "I think it's scary and really unsafe, too," Chelsie Nieto told affiliate KCPQ. "Because what if it's someone who could have been a terrorist?" The ramp agent appeared to be in OK after the ordeal. He was taken to an area hospital as a precaution, the airline said. He passed a drug test and was discharged. The employee started work at 5 a.m. and his shift was scheduled to end at 2:30 p.m., just before the flight departed. "During a pre-departure huddle, the team lead noticed the employee was missing. The team lead called into the cargo hold for the employee and called and texted the employee's cell phone, but did not receive an answer. His co-workers believed he finished his shift and went home," the airline's blog said. Alaska Airlines said it's investigating.  The man had been on a four-person team loading baggage onto the flight. All ramp employees have security badges, and undergo full criminal background checks before being hired, according to the airline. After the delay, the flight with 170 passengers and six crew members on board made it to Los Angeles early Monday evening. CNN's Greg Morrison contributed to this report.

Article: Arsene Wenger has challenged his squad to put any dreams of a late charge for the Barclays Premier League to bed and focus instead on the cold reality of winning at Burnley on Saturday. Arsenal head to Turf Moor in search of what would be an eighth straight league victory, following on from last weekend's 4-1 triumph over Liverpool. Despite their superb run, which has seen confidence grow after some 15 wins in the last 17 through all competitions, the title remains Chelsea's to lose, as the leaders currently hold a seven-point advantage and also a match in hand. Nacho Monreal, Theo Walcott, Hector Bellerin and Olivier Giroud appear in good spirits during training. Mesut Ozil shares a joke with Monreal at Arsenal's training HQ while Alexis Sanchez has his shorts rolled up. Santi Cazorla is set to make his 100th Premier League appearance while Abou Diaby is back from injury. While some Gunners fans may have allowed themselves a little bit of fantasy football results over the run-in, which will see Chelsea come to the Emirates Stadium on April 26 and also play both Manchester United and Liverpool, Wenger remains very much focused on the job in hand. 'I have enough experience to know that I have to live with reality and reality is points and the next game,' he said. 'The dreams are for everybody - we all have dreams at night, but when I wake up in the morning I have to come here and make sure we give everything to win the next game.' Wenger continued: 'Chelsea have a difficult schedule, we have a difficult schedule, but what we can only do is master our own schedule. 'What we want is to go as high as we can until the end of the season, give our best and we are also in the semi-final of the FA Cup. 'So we are at an important moment of the Premier League season and it is a period where you show your quality by focusing on the next game and maintain the quality. 'Of course we want to continue to progress and improve - we can learn from victory as well and everything was not perfect in our last game.' Mathieu Flamini, Ozil and Sanchez are pictured at Arsenal's London Colney base on Friday. Laurent Koscielny is put through his paces on Friday as he bids to return to full fitness. Jack Wilshere hasn't played since November but is in line to feature at Burnley on Saturday evening. Arsenal's injury problems look to have finally eased, with midfielders Mikel Arteta, Jack Wilshere and Abou Diaby all having stepped up their rehabilitation from injury, along with full-back Mathieu Debuchy. England international Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, though, continues to be hampered by an inflamed groin, while centre-half Laurent Koscielny will face a fitness test on his thigh problem ahead of Saturday's match. Burnley continue to scrap at the other end of the table, currently second bottom, but only two points from safety. With Manchester City having gone down 1-0 at Turf Moor last month and Tottenham then held to a goalless draw, Wenger is not taking the trip to Lancashire lightly. He said: 'You shouldn't look at the table because they started slowly, but recently they have played very well against all the big teams in the league and are quite efficient at home. 'You have to be at their level of physical performance, because they will be there. 'On the rest, you want to produce the quality of performance that is expected from us on the technical side, but you have first to fight with them physically, that's for sure. 'We have to make sure we produce the expected performance on the commitment, on the focus and on the quality of our game.'

Article: (CNN)One year after it was perpetrated, the kidnapping of nearly 300 schoolgirls by a jihadist group in Nigeria remains a crime almost too horrifying to comprehend: Hundreds of teenaged girls, just finishing school, destined perhaps for significant achievement -- kidnapped, never to be seen again. "This crime has rightly caused outrage both in Nigeria and across the world," the country's President-elect, Muhammadu Buhari, said Tuesday in marking the anniversary. "Today is a time to reflect on the pain and suffering of the victims, their friends and families. Our thoughts and prayers, and that of the whole Nigerian nation, are with you today." The girls were abducted on the night of April 14-15, 2014, in the town of Chibok, in northeastern Nigeria, about a two-hour drive from the border with Cameroon. The Government Girls Secondary School had been closed for a month because of the danger posed by Boko Haram militants, who are opposed to Western education, particularly for girls. But students from several schools had been called in to take a final exam in physics. The militants stormed the school, arriving in a convoy of trucks and buses and engaging in a gun battle with school security guards. Then they forced the girls from their dormitories, loaded them into trucks and drove them into the forest. Most have never been seen since, except in a photograph in which they sat on the ground in a semi-circle, clad in Islamic dress. They were between 16 and 18 years old. Police said the militants kidnapped 276 girls in all. About 50 managed to escape soon after they were abducted. Those who did not, it is feared, may have been raped, brutalized, enslaved and forced to convert to Islam. Their parents were stricken with grief. The world was appalled. On Twitter, a hashtag began trending and spread around the world: #BringBackOurGirls. On Tuesday, Malala Yousafzai, the 17-year-old Pakistani girl who was shot in the face for speaking out in favor of girls' education, sent a message to the kidnapped girls. "I am one of the millions of people around the world who keep you and your families foremost in our thoughts and prayers," she wrote. "We cannot imagine the full extent of the horrors you have endured. But please know this: We will never forget you." One year later, a few things have changed. Each of the missing girls has had a birthday in captivity. Each is now a year older. Nigeria's current president, Goodluck Jonathan, was defeated in his campaign for re-election, in part, it is thought, because he failed to effectively combat Boko Haram. Buhari, the incoming president, has pledged an aggressive effort to wipe out the group. But much remains unchanged, as well. Boko Haram still controls swathes of northeastern Nigeria. According to UNICEF, 800,000 children have been forced to flee their homes because of the conflict between the Nigerian military, civilian self-defense groups, and Boko Haram. Amnesty International says women and children continue to be abducted. And it says Boko Haram continues to kill in large numbers. Beyond that, more than 200 schoolgirls who had gathered one year ago to take their science exam are still missing.  Their families are still bereft. And Tuesday on Twitter, a hashtag was still trending: #BringBackOurGirls.

Article: Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has confessed his academy players are not ready to step into his first-team squad, hinting that City may look to cherry-pick the best youngsters from their top-flight rivals. In the week that Liverpool’s Raheem Sterling spoke about his unwillingness to agree a new contract at Anfield, Pellegrini’s comments suggest that City may look to invest heavily in other teams’ homegrown talent this summer. Premier League regulations require clubs to carry at least eight homegrown players, which can include youngsters who have spent three of their formative years at an English club. FA chairman Greg Dyke is pushing for the figure to be raised to 12. Manuel Pellegrini says the academy players at Manchester City are not ready for the first team. Pellegrini's assertions may mean City buy English players like Raheem Sterling to reach homegrown quotas. Everton's England international midfield player Ross Barkley has also been linked with City. But the lack of suitable candidates emerging from Patrick Vieira’s academy means City’s only option will be to buy in the bulk of their quota, with the defending league champions also linked with Arsenal’s Jack Wilshere and Ross Barkley of Everton. City’s current group of home-grown players will be reduced in the summer when Frank Lampard departs and it could be further depleted if James Milner, who wants guarantees of more regular first-team football, opts to leave. Coincidentally, Liverpool is Milner’s most likely destination should he leave but the prospect of Sterling moving in the opposite direction has been increased to the point that bookmakers rate City his most likely destination next season. City’s youth system has come under fire in recent seasons for its lack of productivity. Belgian defender Dedryck Boyata, who has started nine league games in nearly six years at City, is the only former academy player anywhere near first-team contention. Pellegrini said: ‘We must be patient with the academy. Young players are important. Maybe it’s not so easy for young players, especially at big clubs, to play in the first team, with the professional squad. But I’m sure in the future we will have very important players coming from the academy. James Milner could leave City in the summer with Liverpool a potential destination. Arsenal midfield player Jack Wilshere has also been linked with a transfer to City. Defender Dedryck Boyata (right) is City's only academy player near first-team contention. ‘But it’s important to have years of working the same way. But you never know. Maybe some talented young players can do it soon.’ Sterling would fit the bill, if his impasse at Liverpool proves unsolvable, although Pellegrini refused to comment directly about the Liverpool and England forward. Pellegrini said: ‘I think it’s important for big clubs to bring in the best players, that’s the most important thing. If they’re all good players, of course I agree with the quota. All the big leagues — especially the Premier League — need the best players to play.’ City’s homegrown quota is made up of Boyata, Lampard, Milner, Joe Hart, reserve keeper Richard Wright and Gael Clichy, who qualifies from his years spent with Arsenal. They are joined by four academy players — Thierry Ambrose, George Glendon, Jose Angel Tasende and Jose Angel Pozo, although Spaniard Pozo is the only one to have been near the first team this season. A number of young City professionals, including John Guidetti at Celtic, PSV’s Karim Rekik and Marcos Lopes with Lille, are on loan and may be brought back to plug some of the holes next season, although a big investment in English talent via the transfer market seems the only option. Frank Lampard helps make up City's homegrown quota but is leaving for New York at the end of the season. Patrick Vieira is overseeing the City academy's production of youth and homegrown players. Striker John Guidetti is on loan at Celtic but could return to meet quota regulations next season. Meanwhile, Pellegrini is not in action until Monday, when he takes his team to Crystal Palace, and with Chelsea in an apparently commanding lead at the top, the City manager admits his side face eight cup finals. He said: ‘I hope we can do it. We have to play eight finals from now until the end. We will see the way we play. I hope the way we finish against West Brom is the way we must continue. ‘It is not easy to make a clear analysis because they play with one player less. I hope in these eight games we continue playing that way.’

Manuel Pellegrini believes his youth players are not ready for the first-team. His homegrown quote will be depleted when Frank Lamapard leaves. Pellegrini may lose James Milner, forcing him to invest in home talent.

Article: (CNN)A hooded angel with black wings appeared on Tuesday near the spot where Walter Scott was shot and killed by a police officer in North Charleston, South Carolina, on Saturday. Since then, it's been taken up as an icon of the Black Lives Matter movement. When protesters held the winged figure at a Wednesday morning rally outside North Charleston's City Hall, the artwork was widely photographed. Creator Phillip Hyman grew up in the neighborhood where Scott, an unarmed black man, was shot in the back several times by a white police officer on Saturday. Hyman now lives in another part of the city and couldn't stop thinking about it. He woke up about 3 a.m. a couple of days after Scott was killed and began searching for materials. "Art is really about that moment. I just couldn't take it any longer," he said. Hyman dug into the trash and found a piece of wood that was the perfect size. Then he picked up a can of black house paint and started making the reclaimed wood into a work of art. The 56-year-old said he crafted the artwork as a way of mourning with the family. "That's who all this should really be about, not about the propaganda and making it your own story," said Hyman, who talks quickly and passionately about his subject material. "Shooting him in the back and just the indignity of it all." The figure, painted black in mourning for the family, has wings because it's going to heaven, Hyman said. The man depicted in Hyman's piece is dressed in a hooded sweatsuit, though that's not what Scott was wearing when he was killed. Hyman said he prefers not to say too much about who the black angel figure is. People can look at the art and make their own interpretations, he said. "It's a statement of where we are in America today. It's relevant in Charleston, Ferguson, Florida, anywhere now." After Hyman put the piece up on Tuesday near where Scott was killed, he got a call from a local protester with the Black Lives Matter movement, which has staged protests around the country in the wake of high-profile deaths at the hands of police. The group asked for permission to use his artwork in its demonstrations at the North Charleston City Hall. Hyman was happy to oblige. Each day, the protesters call Hyman and he either carries the angel-winged artwork to the protest, or the protesters come over to his home to pick it up. "It's taken a life of its own, so I'm letting it do what it's supposed to do now," he said. Freelance photographer Joel Woodhall spotted the artwork and wondered where it came from. Woodhall, who lives in nearby Charleston, said the artwork made him feel sorrow for a life ended too soon. "It was very emotionally moving. It's beautiful," he told CNN. This isn't the first time Hyman has used artwork to effect change: He restored a local theater to its former glory. He commemorated Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday by painting a mural in a bad neighborhood that needed light. Hyman's wife, Kay, says her husband always paints from the heart. "To see this recognized, he just goes into tears because it's very special to him."

Article: Arsenal should target Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech if he leaves Stamford Bridge at the end of the season, insists Carlo Cudicini. Cech has made just five Barclays Premier League appearances this season as Thibaut Courtois remains manager Jose Mourinho's first-choice goalkeeper. But Cudicini feels the 32-year-old Czech Republic international would be a good fit under Arsene Wenger instead of Wojciech Szczesny at Arsenal. Petr Cech, in action for Czech Republic against Latvia last week, is poised to leave Chelsea in the summer. Cech, who joined Chelsea in 2004, has made just five Premier League appearances this season. Chelsea want at least £10million for Cech, and they would have to sell to a direct rival for the goalkeeper to end up at the Emirates. Prompted on TalkSport by Ray Parlour who said Arsenal 'have to get' Cech, Cudicini added: 'I agree. 'Arsenal have had a few problems with goalkeepers after [David] Seaman and [Jens] Lehmann. 'Szczesny is still struggling to impose himself as number one, so if a goalkeeper like Petr Cech is available in the summer, obviously he should be a big target for Arsenal.' Cech revealed last week he does not want to spend another season as understudy to Courtois.

Article: (CNN)For more than four days, police say, a 21-year-old quadriplegic with cerebral palsy was left lying in the woods of Philadelphia's Cobbs Creek Park with only a blanket and a Bible. The person responsible is the man's mother, who on Sunday faced a host of charges after allegedly abandoning her son and catching a bus to Maryland to see her boyfriend, said Philadelphia police Lt. John Walker. Low temperatures reached the mid-30s during the week, and rain was reported in the area Wednesday and Thursday. The man is unable to communicate how he came to be in the park, but Walker told reporters that the man's mother, whom he did not identify for CNN, left him there Monday morning. "Sometime at 11 a.m., the mother went to visit her boyfriend down in Maryland, over in Montgomery County, and we believe she placed the child into Cobbs Creeks Park," Walker said at a news conference. Walker told CNN the man was transported to Presbyterian Hospital, but CNN affiliates reported he was being treated at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. He suffered eye problems, dehydration, malnutrition and a cut to the back that has raised infection concerns, the lieutenant told reporters. "This kid's obviously a fighter," Walker said during a Saturday news conference. "It's just unbelievable how we found him out there last night. To see that kid laying there, it's heartbreaking to see another human, especially a mother, can treat someone like that." Officials at Philadelphia's School of the Future, which the man attends, became concerned when he didn't show up for classes and tried to contact his mother but eventually reached an aunt, CNN affiliate WPVI reported. When police tracked down the mother, she told them her son was with her, Walker said. "She indicated to both family members and the police officers that the child was with her down with her boyfriend in Maryland," he said. The boyfriend was not aware of what happened, Walker told CNN affiliate KYW-TV. The mother now stands charged with aggravated assault, simple assault, reckless endangerment of another person, neglect of a care-dependent person, unlawful restraint, kidnapping and false imprisonment, the station reported. Walker told reporters she bore "clear criminal liability in this case." Maryland police took her into custody on Sunday, and she will face the charges in Philadelphia following an extradition hearing, WPVI reported. There was no reason for the man to suffer, Walker told philly.com, because the mother had sisters willing to take care of him. Two of his aunts, who have tried to obtain guardianship of him, were staying with him at the hospital, police told the website. The mother has another child, a 16-year-old, who is also being taken care of by family members, WPVI reported. The mother's arrest was only the beginning of the investigation, Walker told reporters. Authorities are interested in learning more about "how this kid was cared for, and what actions were taken and providing of services by different agencies." CNN's Carma Hassan contributed to this report.

Article: Stuart McCall expects Shane Ferguson to be fit and ready to aid Rangers’ play-off push towards the Premiership. The Northern Ireland international finally joined up with his Ibrox team-mates this week, more than two months after he was one of five Newcastle players sent north on loan to the Championship side. Ferguson has not played since his country’s 2-0 European qualifier win over Greece in Athens in October and the 23-year-old’s knee injury had been expected to keep him out for the season. Rangers manager Stuart McCall takes a training session at Murray Park on Tuesday morning. But McCall revealed: ‘Shane’s been out for five months but the good thing about him is his mental state. I spoke to him on Monday and I was really impressed. Do I get the impression he is he is here to play? Yes, definitely. ‘I liked the way he was talking, he wants to get straight into it. He’s a naturally fit lad and he seems really focused too, so that was pleasing. ‘He trained really hard on Monday and on Tuesday and he’s on his way to a quick recovery, which would be positive news for us. ‘If our Under-20 game (against Dundee United on Tuesday) had not been on astro turf, he might have got an hour under his belt. ‘But if you’ve been out that long you’re going to need four to six weeks to get back on track. So he certainly won’t be ready in the next two weeks but hopefully he will play his part in the back end of the season.” Newcastle United loanee Shane Ferguson takes part in the training session. Rangers were controversially loaned players from Newcastle in January, when St James’ Park and Sports Direct supremo Mike Ashley was still calling the shots in the Ibrox boardroom ahead of the Dave King-led takeover. Then-manager Kenny McDowall sensationally revealed he had been ordered to play all five when fit. But with Rangers believed not to have carried out medicals, Kevin Mbabu and Ferguson have not featured through injury and fitness, while Gael Bigirimana is believed to have a blood disorder. Defender Remie Street went off injured after 44 minutes of his debut and has not been seen since,. Only Slovenian Haris Vuckic has been a success, scoring six goals in his last seven games. But McCall now hopes he can call on a player who impressed last summer in friendlies for Northern Ireland against Chile and Uruguay. ‘I’ve spoken to a couple of lads like Dean Shiels, who know Shane from Northern Ireland, and it’s all positive,’ said McCall. ‘I also spoke to Northern Ireland manager Michael O’Neill about him. He’s filled in at left-back for them but probably his best position is one up on the left. He’s certainly a good crosser of the ball, he’s shown that in the sessions we have done. Ferguson (right) finally joined up with the Rangers squad in Glasgow this week. ‘I went through his Wikipedia last night and I think he’s played 23 games for Newcastle in the Premier and 30 for Birmingham. You don’t play that number unless you’ve got something about you.’ Rangers must pay Newcastle an extra £500,000 over and above wages for the loan players if they go up through the play-offs but McCall would be delighted if that happens. ‘It was a surprise to everyone when the news about that came out, because it’s quite a lot of money, especially when only one of the (loan players) is playing,’ said McCall. ‘But if it was me - and it’s not because it’s not my money - I’d love to give Newcastle £500,000 because that means we have got promotion.’ Defender Darren McGregor echoed his manager’s views and insisted that promotion was all that mattered after what has been a roller-coaster season. Rangers defender Darren McGregor trains as the club look to claim promotion to the Scottish Premiership. ‘A lot of fans would accept it has been a bad year and all the boys will hold their hands up and say it has not been good enough,’ said the 29-year-old. ‘But if we do get promoted, it would be seen as a successful season. I know that’s quite hard to comprehend but from where we were a couple of months ago, to actually get up would be good. ‘Winning the league would have been great but the aim was always to get promotion. And the way the season has panned out for us, it will now need to be through the play offs.’ Hibs and Rangers are currently locked on 61 points, with Wednesday's match at Livingston representing the Ibrox side’s game in hand. The Easter Road club have a better goal difference of +2 but McGregor is happy that Rangers remain in control of their destiny with Dumbarton away and Falkirk at Ibrox their remaining two matches after their visit to the Energy Assets Arena on Wednsday. Rangers players prepare for the trip to bottom-of-the-table Livingston on Wednesday night. ‘We know our goal difference is short at the moment, but we also know if we keep winning game it’s in our hands to finish second,’ said McGregor. ‘If we beat Livingston, we are three points clear. ‘We want to finish second because that would give us one week more preparation for the play-offs. So we want to win every game until the end of the season. ‘We’ve shown a glimmer of what we are capable of lately and we need to bottle that and take it to Livvy.’

Newcastle  loanee Shan Ferguson finally joined up with Rangers this week. Ferguson has not played since Northern Ireland beat Greece last October. Ibrox boss Stuart McCall checked Ferguson's Wikipedia page on Monday. Rangers travel to take on bottom-of-the-table Livingston on Wednesday.

Article: (CNN)What would you do if a complete stranger asked you for $100, or offered you an apple in a parking lot without explanation? These are only two of the 100 challenges Chinese-born, American-based Jia Jiang put himself up to when he decided to blog about "100 Days of Rejection", a project he launched after he quit his comfortable six-figure job to follow his dreams of being an entrepreneur at the age of 30, just weeks before his first child was born. After his tech start-up was declined investment, Jiang decided to confront his fear of rejection head-on. This led to his writing his book called Rejection Proof, part self-help and part motivational/autobiography, which is being released this week. Famously, in 2012 on his third day of the project, Jiang asked Austin, Texas, Krispy Kreme manager (Jackie Braun) to make him five interlinked donuts to mimic the Olympic symbol. To his surprise, she rose to the challenge and his rejection request faltered. He shared his video and it went viral on Reddit. Before long, Jiang (and Braun) were invited on talk shows and Jiang was being asked to speak at events across the US. Jiang was even offered jobs as his project continued and his fame grew. That wasn't the goal of the project though. "I'm really just a person trying to overcome my own fears," explained Jiang. The project started out to help "fix my own problems, and now I'm helping others fix theirs," he said. "The fear of rejection really holds people back. I'm trying to demystify the idea of rejection." Jiang, who as a child dreamed of being Bill Gates and has been viewed 7 million times on YouTube, has found his entrepreneurial dream in a different role for the moment. "My goal is to turn rejection into opportunity. I always thought it was something to run away from, but if we can embrace it, we can turn it into a lot more than an obstacle." 8 top tips in making rejection work for you:. 1 - The fear of rejection holds us back a lot more than actual rejection. By putting ourselves out there, the world will usually open itself up to you. Though the world can seem cruel and cold, actually humans have a hard time saying no. So open yourself up, don't be afraid to ask for something. If you fail, remember it's not about you. 2 -  Rejection is more or less a numbers game. Sometimes the most far-fetched idea gets a yes. If you talk to enough people, somebody will say yes to you. J.K. Rowling went through 12 rejections to get her yes for Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. 3 - You cannot use rejection to measure the merit of an idea. Sometimes if you really want to change the world, getting rejection is a must. Rejection is a human interaction with two sides. It often says more about the rejector than the rejectee, and should never be used as the universal truth and sole judgment of merit. 4 - Don't run away after a no. The most common thing we do when we're rejected is we want to run because rejection is painful - you're hurt, angry and you lose confidence. But actually if we know how to handle it, we can often minimize the chance of rejection. Be confident, engaging, collaborate. I used all of these traits to maximise getting a yes. 5 - Ask why? When you get rejected you have to find out why. Then spend time to find solutions to solve that why. Sometimes through this process you learn there is something else you can ask for. Ask for an intermediate position rather than the top position. 6 - Set a number of how many no's you can take. In his book, Jiang helps his wife set out to get her dream job at Google. He tells her that instead of thinking about getting a job, she needs to prepare herself for how many no's she can take.  In the end, she was offered a job at Google. 7 - Be invincible. By the end of his project, Jiang said he felt he could ask anything from anyone and not have the pain of rejection. It was a gradual process - gradually my comfort zone expanded. It's like a muscle, I could become stronger and stronger. 8 - Stand tall and remember rejection is an opinion. People are who they are. A lot of people will reject you because of their mood, their education, their upbringing, and you can't change who they are. But you can stand confidently. Innate confidence comes across.

Article: It seems that scoring stunning volleys in Tyne-Wear derbies is not the limit of Sunderland striker Jermain Defoe's limits as he shows off his impressive keepy up skills with a tennis ball. Fresh from his heroics on Sunday when he struck a brilliant volley to earn his side victory against Newcastle at the Stadium of Light, Defoe was the first player to take part in Sunderland's keepy up challenge. The former Tottenham forward set an impressive score of 76 for his team-mates to beat before taking the second part of the challenge - keepy ups with a Creme Egg. Tyne-Wear derby hero Jermain Defoe takes on the Sunderland keepy up challenge. The former Tottenham and West Ham striker is the first Sunderland player to take the challenge. Defoe eventually sets an impressive score of 76 for his team-mates to attempt to beat. Defoe was unable to replicate the high score achieved with the tennis ball but managed to post a respectable-looking nine with the Easter treat. Defoe was overcome with emotion in the wake of his brilliant blast, and admits the joy it brought to a sold-out Stadium of Light was too much to take in. 'I have said many times that I missed the Premier League and it's because of games like this,' he said. 'Games like this are why I came back. Being at a club like this, they just love football. I was told before that if I come here and work hard and score goals, they won't ask for anything more. Sunderland striker Jermain Defoe celebrates after scoring a stunning volley against Newcastle. Defoe's superb first-half strike was enough to secure a 1-0 win for Sunderland in the Tyne-Wear derby. Newcastle goalkeeper Tim Krul was completely helpless as Defoe's shot found its way into the top corner. 'And I just love scoring goals, the fans deserved it. It's been really difficult for them in the last few weeks but they always turn out. 'It was the whole occasion really that got to me. It was great to be the person that made so many people happy. I was just thinking, "Why me?". 'As the whistle went for half-time and as I was walking down the tunnel I thought, "I'm crying and I'm on the telly", but I didn't care. For the fans and everyone it was just a special day.' The 32-year-old not only wrote his name into Sunderland folklore with his derby winner at the weekend but boosted Dick Advocaat's side survival hopes. The North East club moved three points clear of the relegation zone with seven games to play as the Dutch manager earned his first win since taking charge.

Article: (CNN)It was like a scene out of "Make Way for Ducklings" on Tuesday on a rainy street in Washington. CNN Situation Room correspondent Brian Todd and photojournalist Khalil Abdallah were on their way to interview a legal analyst on L Street NW when they happened on a brood of baby ducks causing a stir. Abdallah reports the ducklings and their mom had crossed heavily trafficked street, and some restaurant patrons stopped on the sidewalk to corral them. A man gave up his umbrella for the cause "while the mom was going crazy." "One duckling tried to run back to the street but they caught it in time," Abdallah said. The mother duck followed the umbrella while pedestrians stopped cars on L street for them to safely cross the road. The Washington Post reports the pedestrians took the bird family to "a more enclosed grassy area" at 16th and L streets NW. (Yes, baby ducks warrant two national news stories.) "We thought it was an extraordinary situation," Todd said. "You see pigeons, you see squirrels, you see the occasional raccoon in the D.C. area, and... you  see deer...

Article: (CNN)Police added attempted murder to the list of charges against the mother of a quadriplegic man who was left in the woods for days, Philadelphia police spokeswoman Christine O'Brien said Tuesday. Nyia Parler cannot be extradited to face the charges in Philadelphia until she completes an unspecified "treatment," Maryland police said Monday. When she does arrive, she will be charged with aggravated assault, simple assault, recklessly endangering another person and related offenses, in addition to the attempted murder count, O'Brien said. The Montgomery County (Maryland) Department of Police took Parler, 41, into custody Sunday after Philadelphia police reported that she left her 21-year-old son in the woods while she hopped a bus to see her boyfriend in Maryland. A man walking through the woods found him Friday "lying in leaves, covered in a blanket with a Bible and a wheelchair nearby," Philadelphia police say. Citing federal health care privacy laws, Montgomery County police spokesman Capt. Paul Starks said he could not divulge why Parler was receiving treatment, but he said she had to complete it before she could be extradited. She remained in treatment as of Tuesday morning, Starks told CNN. If she chooses not to challenge her extradition, she will be transported to Philadelphia once the treatment is complete, he said. For more than four days, police say, the quadriplegic man, who also suffers from cerebral palsy, was left lying in the woods of Philadelphia's Cobbs Creek Park. Low temperatures reached the mid-30s during the week, and rain was reported in the area Wednesday and Thursday. The man is unable to communicate how he came to be in the park, but Philadelphia police Lt. John Walker told reporters that the man's mother left him there the morning of April 6. Starks identified the mother as Parler on Monday. "The mother went to visit her boyfriend down in Maryland, over in Montgomery County, and we believe she placed the child into Cobbs Creeks Park," Walker said at a news conference. Walker told CNN the man was transported to Presbyterian Hospital, but CNN affiliates reported he was being treated at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. He suffered eye problems, dehydration, malnutrition and a cut to his back that raised infection concerns, the lieutenant told reporters. "This kid's obviously a fighter," Walker said during a Saturday news conference. "It's just unbelievable how we found him out there last night. To see that kid laying there, it's heartbreaking to see another human, especially a mother, can treat someone like that." Officials at Philadelphia's School of the Future, which the man attends, became concerned when he didn't show up for classes last week and tried to contact his mother but eventually reached an aunt, Philadelphia police said. "The aunt was in contact via text message with Nyia throughout the week and when she expressed her concerns about the complainant, Nyia replied, 'We're OK,' which the aunt believed meant that the victim was with Nyia in Maryland," according to a police news release. When police tracked down the mother, she told them her son was with her, Walker said. "She indicated to both family members and the police officers that the child was with her down with her boyfriend in Maryland," he said. The boyfriend was not aware of what happened, Walker told CNN affiliate KYW-TV. Walker told reporters she bore "clear criminal liability in this case." There was no reason for the man to suffer, Walker told philly.com, because the mother had sisters willing to take care of him. Two of his aunts, who have tried to obtain guardianship of him, were staying with him at the hospital, police told the website. Parler's sister told police that Parler has another child, a 16-year-old. The mother's arrest was only the beginning of the investigation, Walker told reporters. Authorities are interested in learning more about "how this kid was cared for, and what actions were taken and providing of services by different agencies." CNN's Chuck Johnston and Carma Hassan contributed to this report.

Article: Bayern Munich's treble ambitions are put to the test on Wednesday in the German Cup quarter-final when their injury-hit side travel to in-form Bayer Leverkusen. The Bavarians, runaway leaders in the Bundesliga and through to the Champions League last eight where they face Porto later this month, are eager to repeat their 2013 treble-winning campaign as the season enters its final stretch. A 1-0 league victory at Borussia Dortmund on Saturday despite a string of absences was crucial to boost their confidence ahead of the Cup game, goalkeeper Manuel Neuer said. Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer celebrates after the 1-0 win against Borussia Dortmund on Saturday. Neuer made a spectacular in injury time from a Marco Reus free kick to ensure the three points. 'The 1-0 victory was a very good sign for us,' Neuer, who made a spectacular save in stoppage time to protect their slim lead, said. 'We have to try to carry this momentum to our game at Leverkusen.' Bayern were without wingers Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben as well as David Alaba, who tore a knee ligament and will be out for about two months. They were also missing defender Holger Badstuber, forcing coach Pep Guardiola to overhaul his team and play a new-look midfield with captain Philipp Lahm, Xabi Alonso and Bastian Schweinsteiger. 'I would have liked to have played differently but I have to adapt the system to my players,' said Guardiola. Neuer advances from his line to beat Reus to the ball during the clash at Signal Iduna Park. Manager Pep Guardiola is having to content with a number of injuries ahead of the German Cup quarter-final. Guardiola, in his second season in charge after winning the domestic double last year, will have the chance to slightly alter his system again with midfielder Thiago Alcantara making a comeback on Saturday after more than a year out injured. The addition of the skilled Spain international is undoubtedly a major asset ahead of Leverkusen, who crushed Hamburg SV 4-0 in their league game on Saturday. Ribery could also be back in time for Wednesday's game, providing Guardiola with more punching power. Leverkusen, eager to remain in the top four to secure yet another Champions League campaign next season, have won their last five Bundesliga games without conceding a goal as they hit top form. Former Barcelona midfielder Thiago Alcantara made his first appearance for a year against Dortmund. 'We want to advance but we know it will be hard,' Leverkusen's Gonzalo Castro said. 'We know what we can do and we can play with confidence. Our counter attacks are extremely fast and good. After our 4-0 win and five straight victories our confidence is very high.' In another all-Bundesliga clash Borussia Dortmund, finalists last season, take on Hoffenheim on Tuesday eager to edge closer to the final and a possible European spot after a dismal league showing this season. VfL Wolfsburg face Freiburg and Borussia Moenchengladbach take on third-tier Arminia Bielefeld in the other two quarter-finals.

Bayern Munich won 1-0 in Dortmund in the Bundesliga on Saturday. A Bundesliga, Cahmpions League and German Cup treble is on for Bayern. Pep Guardiola's side face Bayer Leverkusen in the Cup quarter-final. Manuel Neuer looking for Bayern to build momentum in cup on Wednesday.

Article: (CNN)After a Russian fighter jet intercepted a U.S. reconnaissance plane in an "unsafe and unprofessional manner" earlier this week, the United States is complaining to Moscow about the incident. On Tuesday, a U.S. RC-135U was flying over the Baltic Sea when it was intercepted by a Russian SU-27 Flanker. The Pentagon said the incident occurred in international airspace north of Poland. The U.S. crew believed the Russian pilot's actions were "unsafe and unprofessional due to the aggressive maneuvers it performed in close proximity to their aircraft and its high rate of speed," Pentagon spokesman Mark Wright said. Russian state news agency Sputnik reported the U.S. plane was flying toward the Russian border with its transponder switched off, according to a Defense Ministry spokesman. Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said the Russian jet flew around the U.S. plane several times to identify it and get its tail number. An official with the U.S. European Command said the claim that the transponder was off was false. Wright said the Pentagon and State Department will "file the appropriate petition through diplomatic channels" with Russia. This is not the first time the U.S. has complained about an incident involving a RC-135U and a SU-27.  A year ago, a Russian jet flew within 100 feet of a RC-135U over the Sea of Okhotsk in the western Pacific, according to U.S. officials who called it "one of the most dangerous close passes in decades." The Pentagon complained to the Russia military about that incident. Russian and U.S. aircraft often encounter each other, both in Northern Europe as well as the area between the Russian Far East and Alaska. CNN's Steve Brusk and Jamie Crawford contributed to this report.

Article: Chelsea goalkeeper Thibault Courtois insists he has not lost any sleep over his high-profile errors of recent weeks. The Belgian was exceptional for the Blues in their win over Queens Park Rangers on Sunday. It was a far cry from his displays in Chelsea's previous two matches, however. Thibaut Courtois (centre) was in phenomenal form as Chelsea beat rivals Queens Park Rangers on Sunday. Courtois (centre) has struggled in previous weeks and his error led to a  goal for Hull on March 22. Courtois cut a despondent man against Hull (left) but was back on form against QPR on Sundat. His poor touch allowed Abel Hernandez to score in Chelsea's 3-2 win over Hull on March 22 before Stoke's Charlie Adam beat him from 66 yards last weekend. But Courtois says his confidence levels have not waned as a result. 'I never doubted that I can't catch the ball. Against Hull, I just tried to make the best solution,' he said. 'It was not the best control, but in the second half I showed that I am mentally strong and I saved the team. 'Against Stoke, if you want to play high as a team, you as a goalkeeper have to play high as a team as well. Charlie Adam did a good strike and that can happen. 'But I showed against QPR that if you play high, you can go get the ball from the midfield. If I'm on the 16 yard box, I can go get it there. For me it's not a problem. Courtois has also faced criticism for failing to keep out Charlie Adam's 66-yard strike against Stoke. Courtois (right) said he never doubted himself during his indifferent spell of form for Chelsea. 'I continue. I never doubt myself. That's my strength. I helped the team with two good saves against QPR and I'm happy. 'The most important thing is the team and against Hull and Stoke we still won. 'I'm 22 and still learning. These were moments which I could learn from.'

Thibaut Courtois went into the QPR game in inconsistent form for Chelsea. He had been criticised for his performances against Hull and Stoke. But he excelled at QPR and said he never doubted his form would return. CLICK HERE for Neil Ashton's match report from Loftus Road.

Article: Michael Vaughan, who is favourite to become England’s cricket supremo, was quick to condemn the openers after West Indies got them both out early on. With Jonathan Trott out without scoring in the first over and captain Alastair Cook failing again Vaughan said: ‘Their footwork and their mindset has been about looking to survive rather than getting on top.’ Geoff Boycott was also critical of the pair, saying: ‘Opening batsmen are supposed to face the new ball when it’s doing a little bit. If you can’t play that, you’re in the wrong job.’ Michael Vaughan criticised the footwork and mindset of England's top order for just looking to survive. Jonathan Trott was out for a duck on his return to the Test match side in Antigua. Alastair Cook was clean bowled by Kemar Roach for 11 as England struggled on the first morning. Former fast bowler Bob Willis said: ‘England’s top three looked constipated and need a good dose of syrup of figs.’ West Indies’ early success after putting England into bat appeared at that stage to make a mockery of the comment by Colin Graves, the new England and Wales Cricket Board chairman, who labelled the opposition ‘mediocre’.

Article: (CNN)A new Kansas law banning a common second-term abortion procedure is the first of its kind in the United States. The law, signed by Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback on Tuesday, bans what it describes as "dismemberment abortion" and defines as "knowingly dismembering a living unborn child and extracting such unborn child one piece at a time from the uterus." Supporters of the measure described it as a groundbreaking step, while opponents warned it was dangerous and among the most restrictive abortion laws in the country. The law does not spell out a specific time frame that limits when an abortion can occur, but it bans the dilation and evacuation abortion procedure commonly used during the second trimester of pregnancy. The law allows for the procedure if "necessary to protect the life or health of the mother," according to a statement on Brownback's website. On Twitter, Brownback, a Republican, said he was proud to sign a law "protecting life at its most vulnerable stage." Planned Parenthood Advocates of Kansas and Mid-Missouri sharply criticized the move, which it described as the latest in a series of "extreme political measures aimed at denying women access to health care and at undermining their decision-making ability." "Kansas is now not only the sole state with this atrocious law; it also now has more restrictions on abortion than any state in the U.S.," the advocacy group said in a Facebook post. Both sides appear to be prepared to take their battle over such measures to other states -- and to court. Carol Tobias, the president of National Right to Life, said in a statement that the Kansas law was the first of what her organization hopes "will be many state laws." "This law has the power to transform the landscape of abortion policy in the United States," she said. Julie Burkhart,  CEO of Wichita-based South Wind Women's Center, said on Twitter that the signing of the law marked a sad day for Kansas and the United States. "This law puts women at risk and ties doctors' hands," she said. "We'll continue to fight!" CNN's Sam Stringer contributed to this report.

Article: North vs South - it's perhaps the fiercest argument between the people of England and this week we've started a fresh debate based on football. We have assembled two dream teams - one featuring players from the Premier League clubs in the South of England and the other featuring Northern-based stars. On Monday, Rob Draper revealed who he'd select in the Southern XI and on Tuesday, Joe Bernstein did likewise for the North. We then sent the All-star teams to our friends at Football Manager, who have simulated the match. Here's what happened... So, now we know: the South has the edge over the North for footballing talent. Alexis Sanchez and Harry Kane were the heroes as the Southern All-Stars came out on top in our simulated clash between the Premier League's best players from the North and South. Despite falling behind less than a minute into the game to a stunning finish from Sergio Aguero, who was supported up front by Wayne Rooney, the Southern XI were able to mount a fightback with a brace from Sanchez either side of Harry Kane's second-half goal. SCROLL DOWN TO WATCH A VIDEO OF THE SIMULATED MATCH. Alexis Sanchez of Arsenal (left) starred in our simulated All-Star game, while Spurs striker Harry Kane (right) also scored in the match. Manchester City hotshot Sergio Aguero gave the Northern combined XI the lead after less than a minute, but his team were still beaten. The Southern All-Stars boasted Harry Kane up front while the Northern side was led by Sergio Aguero and Wayne Rooney. The Southerners saw less of the ball and created fewer chances but were more clinical in front of goal than the Northern All-Stars, who twice hit the woodwork. After Aguero's early strike, the South battled back and went close through Morgan Schneiderlin and John Terry. Their pressure was rewarded when Sanchez linked up with Kane and buried his shot  from inside the area. Kane added his name to the scoresheet in the second half with a well-taken finish following some lovely build-up play by Eden Hazard, Santi Cazorla and Schneiderlin. Sanchez then rounded off the victory with a clinical, powerful effort 20 minutes from time. The Northern team were made to rue missed opportunities after creating three clear-cut chances to the South's two but didn't convert them. Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez is the stand-out in Football Manager's player ratings with 6.1 while Martin Skrtel was least effective for the North. The Northerners enjoyed marginally more possession than their rivals and won 13 corners but failed to kick on after Aguero's opener. The Southerners’ manager Rob Draper will be delighted by his team's smooth transitions from defence to attack, and their elaborate passing play in the middle of the park. It could well have been a different story, however, had Joe Bernstein's Northern side been able to convert their chances. Martin Skrtel will be unhappy with his performance in the centre of defence too. The men in red looked threatening on the flanks, particularly through Raheem Sterling, but far too often they failed to capitalise on his excellent service. Aguero conspired to miss from six yards out when unmarked in injury-time to sum up their profligacy. That meant a comfortable margin of victory by two goals for the Southern All-Stars and bragging rights over their Northern neighbours. But, somehow, we suspect the old debate over which half of England reigns supreme will continue. MATCH HIGHLIGHTS (SCROLL DOWN TO WATCH A VIDEO OF THE SIMULATION) 1st minute: GOAL!!! The pre-match hype is immediately justified as Sergio Aguero picks up a short pass from James McCarthy, dribbles past Jose Fonte and curls the ball past Thibaut Courtois to make it 1-0 to the Northern All-Stars. Aguero (centre, in red) slots home the opening goal in the very first minute of the All-Stars clash. 8th minute: A Santi Cazorla corner finds the head of John Terry but his effort is fractionally too high. Santi Cazorla's pinpoint corner finds captain John Terry at the near post but the Chelsea legend's header clears the crossbar. 10th minute: Raheem Sterling forces Courtois into a decent save with a powerful effort from the edge of the area. 20th minute: A well-worked move by the Southern All-Stars culminates in a Morgan Schneiderlin volley from 25 yards that whistles over Joe Hart’s crossbar. 21st minute: A Cazorla free-kick is deflected out for a corner. The delivery from the Spaniard is poor and the Northern All-Stars break with Sterling. After beating two defenders, he elects to try and curl one in from the 18-yard mark but his effort drifts wide of the goal. 29th minute: GOAL!!! A misplaced pass from Aguero gives away possession when the Northern All-Stars look threatening. The Southern All-Stars take full advantage with a direct move down the right flank. The ball finds its way to Kane, who plays a pinpoint pass to Sanchez to calmly slot the ball into the bottom corner and level the match. Sanchez (top, in blue) slots past Joe Hart in the Northern XI's goal to score the equaliser. 36th minute: Some clever interplay between Rooney and Aguero opens up the Southern All-Star defence. 39th minute: More good play from Aguero and Rooney creates a half-chance for the Northern All-Stars but the Argentina striker drags his shot wide. Southampton midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin attempts an ambitious volley from 25 yards but it meets the same fate as Terry's header. HALF-TIME: Southern All-Stars 1-1 Northern All-Stars. Substitution: Michael Carrick is replaced by Yaya Toure. 46th minute: The Northern All-Stars very nearly take the lead straight from kick-off after more good work on the right from Sterling. He slips the ball into Rooney, whose shot is turned onto the post by Courtois. 57th minute: Substitution: David Silva makes way for Ashley Young. 60th minute: Substitution: Phil Jones replaces Ryan Shawcross after the Stoke man takes a knock from a robust Alexis Sanchez challenge. The Northern All-Stars have used all their substitutions. 66th minute: Double Substitution: Nathaniel Clyne and Nemanja Matic are subbed off for Branislav Ivanovic and Fabian Delph. Following the substitutions, the Northern All-Stars push forward with Toure giving the team more purpose in the middle of the park. Toure's raking through ball is met by Sterling who thinks he has made it 2-1 only for the linesman to raise his flag. 68th minute: GOAL!!! Courtois sends the resulting free-kick long and the Southern All-Stars work the ball to Schneiderlin on the edge of the area. His through ball to Kane is weighted to perfection and the striker races onto it before slotting home to put his team in front. Kane (second right, in blue) raises his arm in celebration after putting the Southern All-Stars in front for the first time. 72nd minute: GOAL!!! The Southern All-Stars wrap up the match with Sanchez’s second goal. More intricate build-up play in the midfield allows Sanchez to lose his man, take a touch and hit a powerful effort that beats Hart. Sanchez (bottom right, in blue) notches his second goal of the game to settle the contest at Wembley. 81st minute: From a throw-in on the left, Young feeds Aguero, who has acres of space ahead of him and men arriving in the box. He chooses to go it alone but Courtois makes a comfortable save down to his right. Aguero storms into the box and ignores support on his inside to take a shot from a tight angle, but it's easily saved by Thibaut Courtois. 83rd minute: A corner from the Northern All-Stars is only half cleared to Young but his shot is blasted into the side netting. 88th minute: The Northern All-Stars work an opening from a free-kick but Rooney’s effort is poor and straight at Courtois. 90+2: The simplest chance of the match falls to Aguero in injury-time after a superb low cross from Sterling. The Manchester City star is unmarked six yards out but can only hit the post. Rooney collects the ball and gets another shot away but Courtois palms it out for a corner. Aguero blows his chance to make the scoreline a little more respectable late on when he hits the upright after low cross from Sterling. 90+3: The resulting corner amounts to nothing and the referee blows the final whistle. FULL TIME: Southern All-Stars 3-1 Northern All-Stars.

Article: (CNN)The killing of an employee at Wayne Community College in Goldsboro, North Carolina, may have been a hate crime, authorities said Tuesday. Investigators are looking into the possibility, said Goldsboro police Sgt. Jeremy Sutton. He did not explain what may have made it a hate crime. The victim -- Ron Lane, whom officials said was a longtime employee and the school's print shop operator -- was white, as is the suspect. Lane's relatives said he was gay, CNN affiliate WNCN reported. The suspect, Kenneth Morgan Stancil III, worked with Lane as part of a work-study program, but was let go from the program in early March due to poor attendance, college President Kay Albertson said Tuesday. On Monday, Stancil walked into the print shop on the third floor of a campus building, aimed a pistol-grip shotgun and fired once, killing Lane, according to Sutton. Stancil has tattoos on his face. Sutton said investigators are looking into whether he is part of a white supremacist gang. He has no previous criminal record, authorities said. Sutton said Stancil fled on a motorcycle after the shooting and ultimately abandoned it in a highway median. Then, Stancil continued on to Daytona, Florida, but authorities don't know how he traveled, Sutton said. He was arrested just after 1 a.m. Tuesday, after he was found sleeping on a beach, about 550 miles (885 kilometers) from Goldsboro. Volusia County Beach Patrol had approached him for violating the city's ordinance against sleeping on the beach. He had a knife, police said. He was taken into custody without incident. Authorities in North Carolina expect to bring him back to face charges. Wayne Community College, a two-year school, has a student population of 3,837, according 2013 figures from the National Center for Education Statistics. Slightly more than half the students are part-time. Crime statistics from the center's website show no killings, assaults, robberies or motor vehicle thefts between 2011 and 2013. There were three arrests for illegal weapons possession in 2012 and three in 2013.

Article: The omens are looking good. After taking the big race on the opening day of the Grand National festival, AP McCoy repeated the trick on Don Cossack to the delight of a huge Ladies’ day crowd. McCoy, who will ride hot favourite Shutthefrontdoor in the Crabbie’s Grand National on Saturday, struck on day one in the Doom Bar Aintree Hurdle with Jezki. If the trend continues, McCoy will be celebrating another victory in the biggest race of all. And if he wanted a further sign that the cards are falling in his favour, the last time he won the Melling Chase – on Alberta’s Run in 2010 – he followed up the next day in the Grand National on Don’t Push It. AP McCoy celebrates after winning the Melling Chase race at Aintree on Friday. McCoy rode Don Cossack to victory as he prepares for his final Grand National on Saturday. There may have been some fortune attached to Jezki’s victory as favourite Arctic Fire fell at the last flight when poised to challenge. Here, though, there was no luck involved. Don Cossack was mighty impressive in running away with The Grade One Betfred Melling Chase, prompting his trainer Gordon Elliot to talk of a challenge for the Cheltenham Gold Cup next year. This was one of the more straightforward successes in McCoy’s career, as once he took up the running three fences from home the result was never in doubt. Don Cossack ridden by McCoy (second left) leads the field on the way to victory at Aintree. McCoy jumps the final fence on Don Cossack as he rides to victory in the Melling Steeple Chase. In the end, there was a yawning 26-lengths back to second placed Cue Card, with John’s Spirit back in third. Elliott, who won the Grand National in 2007 with Silver Birch, said: ‘The horse is the apple of my eye. I was delighted to see him sent on when he was, as we know that he stays. It is nice having a winner for AP, as well. He is a genius. He has ridden a good few winners for me over the years.’ This has been a memorable meeting for Elliott, who saddled a first day double with Clarcam and Tagliatelle. He saddles Cause of Causes in the big one and hopes are high of a bold show. ‘When I won the National last time, I didn’t really appreciate it, ’said Elliott. ‘We are looking forward to tomorrow (Saturday).’

Article: (CNN)Former Australia cricket captain and legendary broadcaster Richie Benaud has died at the age of 84. Benaud, whose witty one-liners from the commentary box resonated far beyond Australia's shores, said last year he was being treated for skin cancer. "After Don Bradman, there has been no Australian player more famous than Richie Benaud," Cricket Australia said on its website. "Benaud stood at the top of the game throughout his rich life, first as a record-breaking leg-spinner and captain, and then as cricket's most famous -- and most impersonated -- broadcaster." A veteran of 64 Test matches, Benaud was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1985. While many regarded his voice as the soundtrack to an Australian summer, Benaud was equally revered by the cricketing public on the other side of the world where he spent more than four decades with the BBC taking the game into millions of British living rooms. But whether you were sitting in Sydney or in South London, there were plenty of "marvelous" Richie moments from the box to savor:. "And Glenn McGrath dismissed for two, just ninety-eight runs short of his century." "From our broadcasting box you can't see any grass at all. It is simply a carpet of humanity." "Captaincy is 90% luck and 10% skill. But don't try it without that 10%." News of his passing quickly generated a wave of condolences, including from Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott. "To most Australians Richie Benaud was cricket. He personified its traditions and its values," Abbott said in a written statement Friday. "While many Australians only know Richard Benaud as the voice of cricket, we should not forget that in his day he was a cricketer with few equals. It was why he was so insightful as a commentator. "As a player his record has withstood the test of time.  He led the Australian side from 1958/59 through to 1963/1964, never losing a series in his 28 Tests as captain. "As captain, he was first to lead a full Australian tour to India and Pakistan in 1959/60. He was the first cricketer to reach a Test double of 2,000 runs and 200 wickets. "Given the special place Richie Benaud has in our national life, I have asked that on the day of his funeral flags fly at half-mast. I extend my condolences and the condolences of the Australian people, to his wife Daphne and his family and friends. Current Australian captain Michael Clarke posted an image of Benaud on Instagram with the message: "What a man. Extremely sad day. You were a lot more then just a cricketer Richie. RIP." Clarke's former teammate Shane Warne also took to Instagram to post a touching letter to the late commentator. He wrote: "Dear Richie, I've known you & Daphne for close to 30 years & to everyone you were a legend on all levels & rightly so too. "As a cricketer, commentator & as a person, you were the best there's ever been & to top it off, an absolute gentleman... For me it was an honour & a privilege to call you a close friend & mentor, we had so many wonderful times together, talking cricket & in particular, our love & passion of leg spin bowling. "I will cherish our entertaining dinners & all the fun times we shared over a long period of time. I would also like to thank you & Daphne for all your support & time you made for me as a young cricketer & leg spin bowler trying to make his way as an 18 year old, your tips & advice along the journey meant so much!!! "Richie, you were loved by everyone, not just the cricket family, you were the godfather of cricket & you will be missed by all... R.I.P my friend." Benaud, who was born in 1930 in Penrith, New South Wales, lead Australia into an era of world dominance as a player. But it was after he hung up his spikes that his legendary status was confirmed. Writing in a column in The Australian, cricket writer Gideon Haigh wrote "television was Benaud's calling, suiting his captain's spontaneity and intuition. "He was authoritative but not pedantic, dignified but not pompous, and never spoke unless he had something to say. He was so popular that many humorists strove to imitate him, so distinctive that none ever quite got him right." The BBC's cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew agreed. "He was quite simply peerless. Nobody else had his authority, popularity and skill," Agnew said in a column on the BBC website. "If you speak to any broadcaster from any sport, they will point to Richie as the standard-bearer." Australian national team coach Darren Lehmann said Benaud set "an incredibly high standard on and off the field." "The fact that Australia never lost a series under his captaincy says so much and those standards were just as high when he turned his attention to calling the game," he told cricket.com.au. "We loved listening to him commentate when the team was together in the dressing room. When he was on air, we always had the TV volume turned up because his comments were so insightful." Benaud's passing also drew messages of sympathy on social media from beyond his native Australia. Imran Khan, the former captain of Pakistan and now a leading politician there, tweeted: "Saddened by the death of Richie Benaud, one of the greatest cricketing brains." While Kumar Sangakkara, the current captain of Sri Lanka's Test team, posted: "So sad to hear about the passing of Richie Benaud. The great voice of cricket is no more. He defined an era with conviction and sincerity." British Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted: "I grew up listening to Richie Benaud's wonderful cricket commentary. Like all fans of the sport, I will miss him very much." CNN's Pierre Meilhan and Azadeh Ansari contributed to this report.

Article: Despite Arsenal winning their eighth Premier League game in a row on Saturday, the club's chief executive Ivan Gazidis says he is 'not happy' that the club are not going to win the title. With top spot set to elude Arsenal again, Gazidis says the club will 'keep pushing' Chelsea, but he admitted winning the championship is unlikely. And Gazidis fears Arsenal will find it harder in future just to maintain their perennial place in the top four Champions League qualification places due to a surge in television cash. Aaron Ramsey smashes the ball home in the win over Burnley, Arsenal's eighth victory in a row in the league. Francis Coquelin wins the ball off George Boyd as the Gunners moved four points clear in second place. Gazidis says the Premier League is 'going to become more competitive which is going to be more challenging for clubs like us.' The Gunners haven't won the league since 2004 and their first eight-game winning run since then has propelled them to second. Earlier setbacks, though, for Arsene Wenger's team helped Chelsea to establish a commanding lead. 'we are not happy but we are going to keep pushing to the end and see how far we can go,' said Gazidis. Ivan Gazidis says he is not happy with second place, and says the club may struggle in the near future.

Article: (CNN)Irish betting company Paddy Power is backtracking after tweeting that "Newcastle have suffered more Kop beatings over the last 20 years than an unarmed African-American male." The tweet, a pun on the name of the famous home end at Liverpool Football Club, alluded to recent controversial incidents in the United States in which unarmed African-American men have been killed by police. Paddy Power -- well-known for its use of publicity stunts -- used it to link to a piece showing statistics for games between Liverpool and Newcastle United ahead of their English Premier League match on Monday. A Paddy Power spokesman told CNN before Liverpool's 2-0 victory at Anfield: "It was a joke, and no offense was meant." The tweet has since been deleted, but its removal -- along with the statement -- did little to placate social media users who condemned the organization, with some calling for the person who wrote the tweet to be sacked. In January, Paddy Power attracted headlines after backing David Ginola's failed candidacy for the presidency of world football's governing body. The former Paris Saint-Germain and Tottenham player could not persuade enough FIFA football associations to back his bid. He needed five to have any chance of unseating Sepp Blatter. Paddy Power started the funding for the candidacy, but its penchant for publicity stunts quickly led many people to dismiss Ginola's bid as another attempt to grab headlines. Paddy Power, the son of one the company's founders and its marketing spokesman, explained: "We've been known for some mischievous activity around the world. This is not that. This is for real." Last year, the company generated anger when it promised "money back if he walks" in relation to the trial of disgraced South African Paralympian Oscar Pistorius. Monday's win put Liverpool fifth in the table, four points behind defending champion Manchester City, which holds England's final European Champions League qualification spot with six games left to play this season. Young England forward Raheem Sterling, who has turned down a new contract, scored a fine solo goal in the first half, and midfielder Joe Allen's 70th-minute strike condemned 13th-placed Newcastle to a fifth successive league defeat. Newcastle, which had France international midfielder Moussa Sissoko sent off in the 83rd minute, has not won at Anfield since a 1-0 victory in the League Cup in November 1995.

Article: (CNN)Desperate migrants from Africa and the Middle East keep heading to Europe, with 978 rescued Friday in the Mediterranean Sea, the Italian Coast Guard said Saturday via Twitter. The migrants were picked up 30 miles off the coast of Libya, said European Parliament member Matteo Salvini, the leader of Italy's far-right Northern League. In the first three months of 2015, Italy registered more than 10,000 migrants arriving, the International Organization for Migration said, and about 2,000 were rescued at sea during the first weekend of April in the Channel of Sicily. Most migrants recorded this year come from countries in West Africa as well as Somalia and Syria, the IMO said. They use Libya as a country of transit. At least 480 migrants have died while crossing the Mediterranean since the beginning of the year, often because of bad weather and overcrowded vessels used by smugglers, the IMO said. Sometimes the captains and crews abandon the ships, leaving passengers to fend for themselves. At this time last year, there were fewer than 50 deaths reported, the IMO said. Most of the migrants are asylum seekers, victims of trafficking or violence, unaccompanied children and pregnant women.

Article: Washington (CNN)President Barack Obama says he is "absolutely committed to making sure" Israel maintains a military advantage over Iran. His comments to The New York Times, published on Sunday, come amid criticism from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of the deal that the United States and five other world powers struck with Iran. Tehran agreed to halt the country's nuclear ambitions, and in exchange, Western powers would drop sanctions that have hurt the Iran's economy. Obama said he understands and respects Netanyahu's stance that Israel is particularly vulnerable and doesn't "have the luxury of testing these propositions" in the deal. "But what I would say to them is that not only am I absolutely committed to making sure they maintain their qualitative military edge, and that they can deter any potential future attacks, but what I'm willing to do is to make the kinds of commitments that would give everybody in the neighborhood, including Iran, a clarity that if Israel were to be attacked by any state, that we would stand by them," Obama said. That, he said, should be "sufficient to take advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see whether or not we can at least take the nuclear issue off the table," he said. The framework negotiators announced last week would see Iran reduce its centrifuges from 19,000 to 5,060, limit the extent to which uranium necessary for nuclear weapons can be enriched and increase inspections. The talks over a final draft are scheduled to continue until June 30. But Netanyahu and Republican critics in Congress have complained that Iran won't have to shut down its nuclear facilities and that the country's leadership isn't trustworthy enough for the inspections to be as valuable as Obama says they are. Obama said even if Iran can't be trusted, there's still a case to be made for the deal. "In fact, you could argue that if they are implacably opposed to us, all the more reason for us to want to have a deal in which we know what they're doing and that, for a long period of time, we can prevent them from having a nuclear weapon," Obama said.

Article: (CNN)There's an old saying which states the Cape Verde Islands are home to a greater number of musicians per square kilometer than any other country in the world. In truth, such a definitive claim may be nigh on impossible to prove. But there is a certain factual accuracy behind the legend: the important and proud relationship the Atlantic island country of just 500,000 people has with music. Situated roughly 350 miles off the west coast of Africa, Cape Verde has long been a mesh of cultures, history and races. The former Portuguese territory was once a key location for the transatlantic slave trade, a target for 16th century pirates and a refuge for exiled Jews. From this diverse melting pot were born the unique sounds of the batuque, morna, funana and other distinct musical styles. Now, Cape Verde is seeking to tap-into the spoils of this rich cultural heritage in a bid to help its economy flourish. Bereft of oil, gas, gold, diamonds or the conventional natural resources that have fueled growth in many other African countries, Cape Verde has had to look for alternative sectors to aid its development. And what's more alternative than a jiving, swinging, musical economy? "Besides fish, it is pretty common (for Cape Verde) to say 'our biggest richness is in music and culture,'" said Christine Semba of Womex, an international networking platform for the world music genre. The economic potential of music has been also acknowledged  by Cape Verde's prime minister, Jose Maria Neves, while the country's ministry of culture is run by Mario Lucio de Sousa, himself a popular musician. "The future of our country lies in our capacity to create, our capacity to innovate," Neves said in reference to the music and the arts at a World Trade Organization conference in 2013. Other elements of the creative economy include handicrafts, fashion and visual arts to name but a few. However, a 2013 report from the UN Conference on Trade and Development noted that Cape Verde's creative sector remained a relatively small part of its economy with much room for improvement and long term planning. But that doesn't mean there hasn't been some promising early signs that music has the potential to play a key role in the future. One early musical success has been the Kriol Jazz Festival. The event, which is celebrating its seventh edition, took place in the capital city of Praia this past weekend. Artists including Grammy-winning U.S. singer Esperanza Spalding have been invited to perform, as have acts from the likes of Luxembourg, Brazil and, of course, Cape Verde. According to Harold Taveres, a liaison to the mayor of Praia involved with promoting the festival, "KJF has become one of the most spectacular events in Cape Verde. "We breathe the music in Cape Verde, we live with the music," he added. "Now the festival has brought people from every corner in the world (to share in this)." During the festival, bars, hotels and restaurants are full to the brim while taxi drivers are seldom unable to find a fare during what locals refer to as "the week of party." It's a lucrative trade, for sure. Yet in order to take full advantage of this bustling scene the country's ministry of culture, alongside some enterprising private sector figures, thought a deeper relationship with the music business was required. Enter the Atlantic Music Expo, a three-year-old conference and networking event that seeks to help Cape Verdean artists secure international exposure. This year's AME took place in the days before the Kriol Jazz Festival. Delegates, local musicians and their management teams were exposed to roundtables, workshops and talks on the intricacies of the global music business. "We try to invite lots of producers and a lot of journalists from around the world to see the festival and the musicians from Cape Verde," said Jose Da Silva, long time manager of the late Cape Verdean songstress Cesaria Evora. Da Silva is one of the driving forces behind AME as well as being the founder of the Lusafrica and Harmonia record labels that aim to discover a new generation of artists from Cape Verde. He hopes that by exposing musicians to a range of experienced industry professionals and top-level musicians, they will become equipped with the tools and ambition to take the music of Cape Verde across the globe. Not only will this help launch the careers of artists and musicians (with all the respective behind the scenes business structures such developments require) but it will garner valuable attention for the country. This is where the greatest potential economic benefits lie. Tourism is expected to account for 20% of the country's GDP by 2024, according to research from the World Travel and Tourism Council. Getting Cape Verde's name out on the world stage through recognition of its rich musical culture is therefore increasingly important. "Economically it's beneficial for the country because the money we would have to spend on the market to give the country this exposure in the world would be too big," Da Silva said. "This way it costs less money." Semba agrees with this, and highlights the joined up thinking of the government and private sector actors like Da Silva for special praise. "In the long term, the whole country is behind this event," Semba said, adding "this is a very innovative approach which we would like to see in many more countries." It must be noted, however, that few countries have the same natural resources for music as Cape Verde. More from Marketplace Africa.

The point for the Seagulls ended a run of three successive defeats, but their goal drought continues and they are now without a goal from one of their own players for nine hours and 20 minutes. Albion are still not out of danger towards the bottom of the table and are seven points above the drop zone with three games left. Brighton's Beram Kayal (left) and Huddersfield's Jacob Butterfield battle for the ball at the Amex Stadium.

Birmingham's highly-rated winger Demarai Gray was on target for the second successive game as his strike rescued a point in City's 2-2 draw against Blackburn at St Andrew's. The hosts twice came from behind to salvage a share of the spoils in the Sky Bet Championship fixture with Gray following up his winner against Wolves last weekend with another classy piece of finishing in the 78th minute. Blackburn captain Matt Kilgallon had put Rovers ahead after just eight minutes with his first goal in over a year. A stirring second-half fight back from Birmingham saw them draw level when full-back Jonathan Grounds grabbed a 64th-minute equaliser. The ever reliable Jordan Rhodes looked to have earned Blackburn only their second win in their last five Championship games with his 18th goal of the season four minutes later. Birmingham City's Jonathan Grounds heads home his side's first goal against Blackburn Rovers. Demarai Gray nets Birmingham's second equaliser during their 2-2 at St Andrew's on Tuesday night. But Gray popped up to ensure Birmingham extended their unbeaten home record to seven games, while Rovers have now not been beaten in eight league and cup matches on the road. Adam Le Fondre's seventh goal of the season rescued a point for Bolton and ensured Charlton's third successive SkyBet Championship draw. The on-loan Cardiff marksman netted for a second successive game after 78 minutes when it seemed Charlton were comfortably protecting Frederic Bulot's ninth-minute opener. Wanderers had goalkeeper Adam Bogdan to thank for keeping it at 1-0 before Le Fondre drew level with Craig Davies at the head of the Trotters' goal charts to salvage a 1-1 draw for Neil Lennon's men. Charlton's Frederic Bulot celebrates with his manager Guy Luzon after opening the scoring against Bolton.

Article: (CNN)"Hamlet." "Romeo and Juliet." "A Midsummer Night's Dream." For centuries, these plays and three dozen more by William Shakespeare have formed history's most heralded literary canon. But now they may have to make room for an addition to Shakespeare's famous oeuvre. New research indicates that "Double Falsehood," a play first published in 1728 by Lewis Theobald, was actually written more than a century earlier by Shakespeare himself with help from his friend John Fletcher. The findings were published this week by two scholars who used computer software to analyze the writings of the three men and compare it with the language of the "newer" play. "The match between the 'Double Falsehood' play and Shakespeare was a landslide. It was shockingly clear," said Ryan L. Boyd, a researcher at the University of Texas at Austin. The study, co-authored by Boyd and UT colleague James W. Pennebaker, was published in the journal Psychological Science. "There's very little wiggle room to interpret the numbers any differently." Boyd said he and Pennebaker analyzed 33 plays by Shakespeare, nine by Fletcher and 12 by Theobald to create a "psychological signature" of each author based on word choices, phrase patterns and other factors. They compared those profiles to the language in "Double Falsehood" and determined that the play's first half was almost entirely written by Shakespeare, though the second half appeared to be split evenly between Shakespeare and Fletcher. Only tiny traces of Theobald's signature were found. "We're certainly not suggesting that Theobald didn't make edits," Boyd told CNN. "But he clearly did not write it." "Double Falsehood," also known as "The Distressed Lovers," is based on the "Cardenio" section of Don Quixote, the classic 17th-century novel by Miguel de Cervantes. Set in Spain, the play revolves around the romantic entanglements of two brothers: one virtuous, one sinful. Theobald said he based the play on three original manuscripts he had discovered, all of them written by Shakespeare. But many scholars have long dismissed the play as a fake, suspecting that Theobald tried to pass the Bard's work off as his own. Shakespeare, who died in 1616, wrote most of his published plays between 1590 and 1612. British publishers Arden Shakespeare published "Double Falsehood" in 2010 -- for the first time in 250 years -- amid renewed claims by experts that it was Shakespeare's work. But the new study by Boyd and Pennebaker, the first to analyze the writings from a psychological perspective, may settle the matter once and for all. Shakespearean scholar Brean Hammond, professor of modern English literature at Nottingham University in the UK, praised the Texas study for its scientific approach. Hammond said Boyd and Pennebaker "have got no dogs in the fight. They're not literary scholars, (so) their work could be seen as more objective than some of the literary studies." Hammond studied "Double Falsehood's" authorship from a literary perspective five years ago and found Shakespeare's DNA evident in the play. But he doubts the new research will put the matter entirely to rest. "Those people who don't believe the play was written by Shakespeare aren't going to just lay down and die," he said.

Article: Nairobi, Kenya  (CNN)Kenya froze dozens of accounts linked to suspected terror supporters after militants massacred 147 people last week at a university in Garissa. The government is tracking the finances of people suspected of ties to Al-Shabaab, the militant group that claimed responsibility for the Thursday attack. So far, the government has frozen 86 accounts, but that number could go up, said Mwenda Njoka, a spokesman for the  Interior Ministry. The government has tracked supporters of the terror group since 2011, and efforts to freeze their assets have gone on since then. It has a list of suspects from various parts of the country, but mostly in Nairobi and Mombasa, he said. Kenyans mourned the victims of the attack Tuesday night at Nairobi's Uhuru Park, where hundreds gathered. Organizers unloaded 147 crosses, some draped with the nation's flag, as candles flickered in the dark. Of the fatalities, 142 were students at the university, and the rest were security forces and campus security. "I can't even look at pictures of the people killed without crying," said Mary Wambui, 32, who lives in Nakuru, hundreds of miles from Garissa. "They were just children. They were trying to make a better life for themselves. Some were first to go to college in their communities. They died trying to get an education." Using the hashtag #147notjustanumber, Kenyans used social media to talk about the lives of the victims. They shared pictures of beaming faces, full of life and energy, in happier days. They talked about parents too shocked to speak after identifying their children's bodies. Some students remain unaccounted for, and wailing relatives alternate their searches between hospitals and morgues. Kenyan authorities have not released the names of the victims. Kenyan authorities had prior intelligence that a university in Garissa could be attacked, yet the country's rapid response team was stuck in Nairobi for hours after the massacre awaiting transport, a police source said Monday. The frozen accounts is the latest in a series of actions as the government faced heavy criticism for the siege, which lasted hours. A spokesman for President Uhuru Kenyatta said authorities "got the job done" and saved lives. The university had about 800 students. "With the benefit of hindsight, you can always say things could have been done better,"  Manoah Esipisu said. Kenya also launched airstrikes Monday targeting Al-Shabaab's training camps in Somalia, according to a military source, who said they were not retaliation for last week's massacre. "The latest attack of Al-Shabaab bases by the Kenya military is part of the ongoing operations that started in 2011,"  the source said Monday. Kenya has also offered 20 million Kenyan shillings, or about $215,000, for information on the whereabouts of Mohamed Mohamud, who allegedly organized the attack. Mohamud is a senior Al-Shabaab leader known by the aliases Dulyadin and Gamadhere, authorities said. Al-Shabaab is based in Somalia, and its violence has spread to Kenya before.  In 2013, militants attacked Nairobi's upscale Westgate Mall, leaving 67 people dead. The terror group has intensified attacks in Kenya since the country sent troops to Somalia four years ago to help battle the militants. CNN's Joseph Netto reported from Nairobi, and Faith Karimi reported and wrote from Atlanta.

Article: (CNN)Jodi Arias was sentenced to life in prison Monday for the gruesome 2008 murder of her ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander. Maricopa County Judge Sherry Stephens could have sentenced Arias to life with the possibility of early release after 25 years, but decided the convicted killer should spend the rest of her life behind bars. Before her sentence was handed down, Arias expressed remorse for her actions. "To this day I can't believe that I was capable of doing something that terrible," Arias said. "I'm truly disgusted and repulsed with myself. I'm horrified because of what I did, and I wish there was some way I could take it back." Earlier, Travis Alexander's sisters gave their victim impact statements. Hillary Alexander said she's trying to block her brother from her life. "I don't want to remember him anymore, because it hurts too much to remember him alive.... I remember how he was brutally taken from us and I can't handle it. This is what I've had to do so I can cope," she said through tears. Arias, 34, was found guilty of first-degree murder in May 2013. The jury that convicted her found the murder was especially cruel, making Arias eligible for the death penalty. However, that same jury was unable to reach a unanimous decision on whether she should live or die. A new jury was empanelled in October 2014 to decide Arias' fate, but they, too, were unable to reach a unanimous decision. Because a second jury was deadlocked in the penalty phase of Arias' case, the death penalty was taken off the table, leaving Arias' sentence up to the judge. Arias will serve her sentence at the Lumley Unit in the Arizona State Prison Complex-Perryville near Goodyear, Arizona.

Article: (CNN)Last month Wu Rongrong was taken into custody for planning to protest on International Women's Day against sexual harassment in China. Since then, the Chinese authorities have formally detained her and four other activists for "creating disturbances." They also briefly detained some of the activists' supporters, raided a prominent nongovernmental organization that called for their release, and have at points denied some of the women access to medical treatment, lawyers and adequate rest. The fate of the five will be revealed by April 13, as their case reaches the legal time limit when they must either be released or "formally arrested," which almost always leads to conviction in China's legal system. The timing of the detentions of China's most inventive women's rights activists is ironic: Not only did they take place on the very day that marks women's achievements and their struggle for equality, but they also come in a year in which Beijing would have won praise for its role in promoting women's rights. It appears poised to adopt its first and long-awaited anti-domestic violence law, which is expected to get a reading before the National People's Congress Standing Committee this summer. This year also marks the 20th anniversary of the influential Fourth World Conference on Women hosted in Beijing, during which Hillary Clinton famously declared that "women's rights are human rights." I first met Wu at a conference several years ago, at a time when there were very few women in China's weiquan  or "rights defense" movement. It was common back then for male colleagues to publicly address them  as "babes" or "little sisters,"  even in professional—and ostensibly progressive—settings.  As women's rights activists, Wu and others fight on two fronts: against overt rights violations by the Chinese government and against the wider gender norms that relegate women to second-class citizens. By the time we met again two years later, Wu and her young "direct-action" feminist colleagues were clearly  off and running.  They staged small, public "performance art" protests that attracted media headlines, energized the more mainstream and academically inclined women's rights movement, and pushed women's rights into the national consciousness and onto the government's agenda. Wu had an upbringing typical of her times.  She comes from the countryside, which for many has changed beyond recognition within their lifetimes.  In recent decades the economy has soared, but her generation is confronting the unhappy consequences of unchecked growth: pollution, unsafe foods and growing inequality between rich and poor. Like many parents, she worries about how to find untainted milk powder for her infant boy, and whether to keep her child with her in the city or to send him to his grandparents in the countryside for a quieter, safer upbringing. Many in Wu and her colleagues' generation are clear-eyed about the problems of China's development model, and some want to address those. Wu joined Yirenping, a nonprofit organization that promotes social equality, whether it is between sexes or among people with and without disabilities, and later founded the women's rights organization Hangzhou Women Center. And it is in Yirenping that she became particularly attuned to the challenges confronting young women in modern China.  Wu and her colleagues have used innovative tactics with a certain shock factor — "occupying" public toilets to show the need for more such conveniences for women, donning blood-spattered wedding gowns to protest domestic violence, shaving their heads to protest against barriers to higher education for women — that raises awareness of gender inequality in ways that resonate, especially with young women in the country. Perhaps this is what the government finds threatening: that these activists epitomize the spirit of the times. They are young, confident, ready to challenge established norms, and most importantly, they feel responsible for their society and they want to improve it. As China prepares to mark the anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women in September, it will be harder for the authorities to justify detaining these activists. But even if they are released, their work promoting women's rights will have become exponentially more difficult. The women will now be labeled "sensitive" individuals at a time when the authorities are increasingly paranoid about independent groups, their role in fostering nonviolent protests and the overthrow of oppressive governments (known as "color revolutions"), and foreign funding of civil society organizations. What Wu and her colleagues are now enduring is consistent with a broader government effort to strangle independent activism.  Authorities have harassed and detained an ever expanding list of activists, and imprisoned others, but they have also tried to co-opt some groups by allowing them to provide services the government finds acceptable, so long as they abandon their activism. This kind of "differentiated management" of nongovernmental organizations — punishing some but co-opting others — may work to neutralize some of the more outspoken groups. But ultimately the desires for change among ordinary people that make Wu and her friends' campaigns so popular are unlikely to be answered through "authoritarian activism" alone. The Chinese Communist Party now faces a dizzying array of challenges, not least that younger generations do not identify with the party or its values like past generations. Rather than lengthening its list of challenges, the party could resolve some and lessen concerns about its legitimacy by freeing and engaging activists like Wu and her colleagues, rather than treating them as criminals.

Article: Harry Kane's participation with England at this summer's Under 21 European Championship remains in  doubt after Tottenham confirmed they will travel to Malaysia for a post-season friendly. Spurs announced on Tuesday morning they will visit Kuala Lumpur next month to take on a Malaysia XI in the AIA Cup. The match will take place at the Shah Alam Stadium on Wednesday, May 27 - before Tottenham  take on Sydney FC the following Saturday - and Kane has been told he will be part of the travelling party for the two exhibition games. Harry Kane could miss the Under 21 European Championship due to Tottenham playing a friendly in Malaysia. Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino has expressed fears about burnout for the 21-year-old striker with the FA in talks with Tottenham officials about Kane playing for the Under 21 side in the Czech Republic at this summer's tournament. Kane is keen to play in Gareth Southgate's side at the championship, which runs from June 17-30, but Pochettino wants the forward to miss the tournament in order to have enough recovery time ahead of next season. The young Tottenham forward, who captained his side during Sunday's 0-0 draw with Burnley, has been told he will not be required for the senior friendly against the Republic of Ireland on June 7 or the Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia a week later. Kane scored just 79 seconds into his England debut after coming off the bench to head home during last month's 4-0 win over Lithuania at Wembley. At just 21 years and 251 days, the Tottenham striker led out his side for the first time in draw with Burnley. Kane could not find a way to break the deadlock for Tottenham in the stalemate at Turf Moor on Sunday. Kane scored just 79 seconds into his England debut during the 4-0 win over Lithuania at Wembley last month.

Article: (CNN)Malala Yousafzai's stellar career has included a Nobel Peace Prize. Last week, she made it into outer space. A NASA astrophysicist has named an asteroid after the teenage education activist from Pakistan, who was gravely wounded by a Pakistani Taliban gunman for promoting the right of girls' to go to school. It took a meticulous medical response to save her life more than two years ago. But Malala recovered with no serious neurological damage to become a powerhouse for her cause. After reading her story, scientist Amy Mainzer, who also consults for PBS on a children's educational science show, decided Malala deserved to be immortalized. So, she attached her name to the heavens. Thousands of asteroids swarm through the solar system mainly between Mars and Jupiter. Mainzer, working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, discovered Asteroid 316201 in June 2010, which gave her the right to name it. "My postdoctoral fellow Dr. Carrie Nugent brought to my attention the fact that although many asteroids have been named, very few have been named to honor the contributions of women (and particularly women of color)," Mainzer wrote in a note to Malala. Mainzer gave it the name 316201 Malala, or 2010 ML48. Malala's asteroid circles the sun between Mars and Jupiter every five and half years, Mainzer said. "It is about 4 kilometers in diameter, and its surface is very dark, the color of printer toner." As a scientist, her support for Malala's work is logical. When girls around the world also get educations, it increases human potential. "We desperately need the brainpower of all smart people to solve some of humanity's most difficult problems, and we can't afford to reject half the population's," Mainzer wrote.

Article: (CNN)Emy Afalava is a loyal American and decorated veteran.  He was born in American Samoa, a U.S. territory since 1900. He has been subject to American law his whole life and thinks he should be a citizen. The Constitution would agree.  The Fourteenth Amendment declares that "All persons born... in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States." Yet, Afalava has been denied the right to vote because the federal government insists that he is no citizen.  How can it be, in the 21st century, that Americans born on U.S. soil are denied the rights of citizenship? That injustice clouds the recent celebration of the 115th anniversary of the decision of American Samoa to join the United States.  It is a wrong that Afalava and other American Samoans are now seeking to right in a federal lawsuit before the D.C. Circuit. A decision could come any day. Since the United States was established, it adhered to the rule that those born on U.S. lands were U.S. citizens.  The rule is colorblind, yet the only exception that the Supreme Court has ever declared was not. The infamous Dred Scott case legitimized slavery as it declared that free African-Americans had "no rights that the white man was bound to respect."  Though they were Americans, they were not citizens under the Constitution. A Civil War later, the 14th Amendment reversed the ruling in the Dred Scott case. Today, the Dred Scott case has come to be regarded as one of the worst decisions in the history of the Supreme Court. But racial discrimination didn't end there. In 1904, a Puerto Rican woman named Isabel Gonzalez sailed for New York.  Because Puerto Rico was U.S. territory, she believed herself to be a U.S. citizen.  But officials at Ellis Island labeled her an undesirable alien and prevented her from entering the mainland.  She sued, with some reason to hope for a favorable ruling. Yet the Supreme Court that eventually heard Gonzalez's case was still racist.  In preceding years, for example, it had permitted a flat ban on naturalizing anyone of the Chinese race. And, in a case addressing the status of recently acquired island territories such as Puerto Rico, the justices had cited the alleged racial inferiority of tropical peoples as reason to treat these lands as second-class U.S. territories.  Justice Edward Douglas White's opinion stated that U.S. sovereignty extended over them, but that their residents did not hold the same constitutional rights as other Americans.  He did so, he privately revealed, because "he was much preoccupied by the danger of racial and social questions." In the Gonzalez case, the justices agreed unanimously that Puerto Ricans were not aliens and thus not subject to immigration laws.  But they declined to decide whether or not Gonzalez was a citizen.  Though preoccupied by fears that islanders were "savages" and racially unfit for citizenship, they were unwilling to violate the Constitution. As a result of the court ruling, federal officials were able to deny Gonzalez and others the full panoply of rights conferred on citizens for years. As Isabel Gonzalez's lawyer told the Court, declaring that residents of America's island territories are not U.S. citizens would mean adding to "precedents in our history of which we are least proud." Those precedents, he warned the Court, had been "repudiated by the American people in the Civil War, by three amendments to the Constitution of the United States, by this court, and by... advancing civilization." Surely, 147 years after the Dred Scott case was overturned, the time has come to put an end to this farce. In the past century, the inhabitants of every other U.S. island territory have become citizens. Today, Emy Afalava and his fellow American Samoans are the last Americans still waiting to become citizens.

Article: (CNN)Over the last year more than 25,000 people, a population about the size of Key West, Florida, have fought Ebola infections. More than 10,000 have not survived. But for those who have survived, life will never be the same. And even for those who did not experience Ebola personally, the "most severe public health emergency seen in modern times" showed the world its vulnerability to disease. It revealed real flaws in government systems that are supposed to protect us. While the intensity of the largest Ebola epidemic in history has died down, and the initial dire predictions that there would be over a million infections by January never came true, dozens are still newly infected each week. The latest World Health Organization Report confirmed a total of 30 new confirmed cases of Ebola were reported in the week of April 5. This is the lowest weekly total since May 2014. But reports are mixed on stopping the virus completely: In Liberia and Sierra Leone, the number of cases has fallen so much, there are more treatment facilities than demand. WHO in Liberia is in the process of decommissioning surplus facilities. But in Guinea, of the 19 confirmed deaths from April 5, seven were only identified as Ebola post-mortem and there were reports of 21 unsafe burials. "Taken together these data indicate that though surveillance is improving, unknown chains of transmission could be a source of new infections in the coming weeks," the latest WHO report said.

Article: (CNN)No prostitutes. No ifs, ands or buts -- and yes, that includes when and where prostitution is perfectly legal. That was the message Friday from Attorney General Eric Holder to members of the U.S. Justice Department, which includes the FBI, U.S. Marshals Service, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and other agencies. "The solicitation of prostitution threatens the core mission of the department," Holder wrote in a memo to all personnel in the department he heads. "... Regardless of whether prostitution is legal or tolerated in a particular jurisdiction, soliciting prostitutes creates a greater demand for human trafficking and a consequent increase in the number of minor and adult persons trafficked into commercial sex slavery." Holder doesn't mention specific cases of federal agents and prostitution in his memo. Nor is he dictating a new policy; the attorney general said only that he wanted "to reiterate to all department personnel, including attorneys and law enforcement officers, that they are prohibited from soliciting, procuring or accepting commercial sex." Agents behaving badly overseas. The directive comes a few weeks after a Justice Department inspector general report found DEA agents in foreign postings attended sex parties with prostitutes paid for by drug cartels, among other indiscretions. That report, by department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, cited light punishments and poor handling of sexual misconduct cases at DEA and other Justice Department agencies. Justice Department employees don't have a monopoly on such stories: In 2012, a group of agents and officers in the Secret Service -- which is part of the Department of Homeland Security -- and officers sent to Colombia ahead of President Barack Obama were relieved of duty and returned home amid allegations of misconduct that involved prostitution. That prostitute visit was arranged for by a DEA agent stationed in Colombia, according to Horowitz's office. If someone from the ATF, FBI, Federal Bureau of Prisons or a federal prosecutor is caught with a prostitute they'll be suspended or fired, according to Holder's memo. "This rule applies at all times during an individual's employment, including while off duty or on personal leave."

Article: It may come as a surprise to some - particularly Arsene Wenger and Pep Guardiola - but Jose Mourinho has revealed how Sir Alex Ferguson inspired him to try to be a gracious manager. The Chelsea boss said in a wide-ranging interview with the Telegraph that the legendary Manchester United manager showed him 'two faces' during their first competitive meeting in 2004 - the first one of a steely rival and the second one of a sporting loser. Mourinho had just made his first impression on the Champions League by knocking out United with unfancied Porto. The Portuguese sprinted down the touchline at Old Trafford in an unforgettable celebration of Porto's last-gasp goal that sealed qualification and a seismic shock. Sir Alex Ferguson and Jose Mourinho formed a firm friendship despite being fierce rivals. Fergie's Manchester United were stunned by Mourinho's Porto in the Champions League in 2004. Mourinho sprinted down the touchline in celebration at Porto's last-gasp goal that sealed qualification. 'That was when I felt the two faces of such a big man,' said Mourinho. 'The first face was the competitor, the man that tried everything to win. And after that I found the man with principles, with the respect for the opponent, with the fair play – I found these two faces in that period, and that was very important for me. 'In my culture, the Portuguese and the Latin culture, we don’t have that culture of the second face; we are in football to win and when we don’t there is not a second face most of the time. But when we beat United in the Champions League I got that beautiful face of a manager which I try to have myself. I try.' Mourinho has attracted controversy like no other manager in the modern game. His many spats with Wenger have seen him form a bitter rivalry with the Arsenal boss, with Mourinho's accusation in 2005 that the Frenchman is like 'a voyeur' perhaps being the moment their relationship hit an all-time low, from which it has never recovered. Mourinho claims to have learned respect from Ferguson, but he has had many spats with Arsene Wenger. He also had a frosty relationship with Pep Guardiola when the pair were rival managers in Spain. The 52-year-old, who looks set to claim his third Barclays Premier League title with Chelsea this season, also formed a spiteful relationship with Guardiola while the pair duelled for honours in Spain. Arguably Mourinho's lowest moment came in gouging the eye of Guardiola's assistant, Tito Vilanova, in the closing stages of a Spanish Super Cup defeat for Real Madrid against Barcelona. After the match he referred to 'Pito' Vilanova - using the Spanish slang for penis. A less surprising Mourinho revelation is that he has no close friends in English football. 'Some, we like each other and have some communication, but I cannot say so close,' he said.

Article: (CNN)Recently, Nashville's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals. Believe it or not, Nashville prosecutors have offered this option four times in the past five years. There has been public outrage at the notion that a defendant in America in 2015 would be offered a choice of sterilization as part of a plea deal. Except, it happens all the time. Some have claimed this practice "evokes a dark corner of American history" where the mentally ill or "deficient" were forced to undergo sterilization. Yeah, that's true.  We did that.  And it was bad. Except this isn't quite that. Female sterilization is linked to the controversial "eugenics" movement, which advocated for the notion that the human race can be improved by selective breeding of people with superior genes. There is even a 1927 Supreme Court case, Buck v. Bell, in which the justices ruled that a state statute permitting compulsory sterilization of the unfit and "imbeciles," "for the protection and health of the state," was constitutional.  The opinion in the case is stunning, especially because the Supreme Court has never technically overruled it. But Buck v. Bell dealt with involuntary sterilization of people because of their mental disabilities, not because they were being punished for a crime. You can hate sterilization, and the Tennessee case may have the creepy feel of the antiquated practice of eugenics, but it's not that. Present-day sterilization plea deals involve a voluntary choice of sterilization by persons accused of a crime, and for whom sterilization will be part of their punishment. Others may argue that the Supreme Court has already spoken on the issue of compulsory sterilization as punishment, and struck it down.  That's true too, sort of. In Skinner v. Oklahoma, the Court struck down a law permitting compulsory sterilization of criminals as unconstitutional, but not because it was cruel and unusual.  Instead, the law was struck down because the law was unequally applied for similar crimes. So the question remains: Is sterilization as a punishment unconstitutional? The Eighth Amendment provides: "Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted." Practically, however, punishments are rarely deemed cruel and unusual by the judiciary.  We have executed people with hangings and by firing squad.  Sterilization has to be somewhere below that, right?  Ultimately, however, the constitutionality of sterilization may be a red herring in this analysis, because it appears that even if a punishment vciolates the Constitution, it is permissible, if you willingly choose it. Suppose arguendo (for argument's sake) that sterilization is judicially labeled a cruel and unusual punishment, violating the Eighth Amendment.  This is where it gets interesting: It still might be an appropriate and constitutional part of a plea deal.  Shocked? You shouldn't be. As citizens, we validly waive our constitutional rights all the time.  You waive your Fourth Amendment protections against search and seizure when you answer "yes" to an officer's "Mind if I look in your trunk?" You waive your Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination when you try to explain to the detective in the interrogation room how that body got in your vehicle's trunk.  So then, if we can validly waive our other constitutional rights, can we waive our Eighth Amendment rights and choose a cruel and unusual punishment, even if it would otherwise be unconstitutional? And are people outraged because this is a new step in punishment or a new frontier and a slippery slope in the world of plea deals? Nope. Sterilization statutes have been around for a while as punishment for defendants all over the country, and defendants have willingly chosen the procedure. If sterilization plea deals are likely constitutional, and we've been doing it for a while, then that begs the question: Why the outrage now?  Why the story that a Tennessee prosecutor was fired for a plea bargain that appears to be widely practiced? There are really only two possibilities. First, some people just had no idea that this was going on until this story hit the news.  Second, even if we knew about it, we didn't mind the practice until now because of one fundamental difference. Most of the sterilization defendants are men. Search your feelings, Luke. When we talk about castrating men who are recidivist sexual predators and child molesters, the idea of castration as punishment doesn't sound so bad right?  Be honest: Let go of your "we're-all-equal-in-all-ways" banner for a moment.  After all, not too long ago, execution was a legal punishment for nonhomicide sex crimes in some jurisdictions. So if we're OK with the gas chamber, we're probably OK with a snip.  It's OK.  You can admit it; we are all hardwired with a modicum of gender bias, whether we like it or not. Still not convinced?  Watch this parlor trick: What if I suggested sterilization for a person convicted of having sex with a minor? So far you're not ruling it out. And what if it's a young female high school teacher having sex with her 17-year-old student? Most of our gut feelings shifted from "maybe" to "no" just now.  It's OK to admit that, too. Of course, sterilization won't prevent a female sex offender from offending again, no more than sterilization will prevent a male offender from offending again.  But the point is, somehow, the notion of sterilizing a male criminal somehow sits better with us than sterilizing a female criminal. Maybe it's that on a primal, unconscious level, what feels cruel and unusual punishment for a woman just feels less so for a man.  Even if you're offended by this theory of why an old practice is now a "shocking" news story, you must concede it fits. Why else has castration of men not been a blip on the radar, but offering a woman the option of sterilization is suddenly a travesty?  Of course, we have to consider the related justification. Overall, a lot more men commit acts that merit sterilization than do women.  Just ask any domestic violence prosecutor. Are sterilization plea deals morally right?  It's hard to say.  For now, they appear to be constitutional, but controversial.  If we know a mother is likely to kill or seriously hurt her current children or her unborn child, should the government step in?  If so, to what degree?  Fortunately, we can avoid a final decision and continue to attack the problem in a way that seems to be more acceptable for now: just keep neutering the men.

Article: Roberto Martinez will hold talks with Kevin Mirallas over his future at the end of the season as he stated his ambition to keep Aaron Lennon. Mirallas was one of Everton’s top performers in the first half of the campaign but his form has tailed off following a number of hamstring injuries and he has wanted by Tottenham during the January transfer window. It was mooted at one point that Mirallas and Lennon could be part of a swap deal but Lennon arrived at Goodison Park on loan and has made a big impression on his manager; it would cost £6million to make his signing permanent when the window re-opens. Roberto Martinez will hold talks with Kevin Mirallas and admits he wants to keep loanee Aaron Lenon. Mirallas has made no secret of his ambition to play in the Champions League and Martinez, whose side face Swansea on Saturday, will speak to him after the final game about what his intentions are moving forward. ‘Every player needs to be pleased and happy with that, so in the summer we'll sit down and assess what has been,’ said Martinez. ‘For that reason the next seven games are vital and will give you a much clearer picture of what you do in the summer. Belgian attacker Mirallas was one of Everton’s top performers in the first half of the campaign. ‘I know there have been a couple of times he's had quotes translated from interviews. I don't think anything he has said is disrespectful or out of the norm. The way I see it he's one of those players who loves playing football and he hasn't got any other motivation. ‘He still has a two year contract. If he were out of contract, I would be worried, but all I want is for him to be fully recovered.’ Mirallas has made no secret of his ambition to play in the Champions League. Lennon has caught the eye in recent weeks and Martinez wants him to maintain his impressive form all the way through until the end of May. ‘He’s been a really impressive footballer,’ said Martinez. ‘The way he’s engaged with the other players has been quite impressive. I think he’s brought know-how and experience but also that freshness of wanting to show what he can do. ‘The next seven games will be very important to see if he can carry on enjoying his football and then like any loan situation it’s a three way conversation that, first of all, the player needs to see that experience as a positive one and then we’ll see what the parent club wants to do. ‘But it’s not a decision we need to make now. The next seven games is an eternity in football.’ Lennon is all smiles as Everton train ahead of their weekend fixture against Swansea City. Lennon is challenged Victor Wanyama during the Premier League match between Everton and Southampton.

Roberto Martinez will hold end of season future talks with Kevin Mirallas. Mirallas has made no secret of his Champions League playing ambitions. Martinez also confirmed he wants to keep Aaron Lennon at Goodison Park. Lennon is currently on loan at Everton from rivals Tottenham Hotspur.

Article: (CNN)After two days of deliberation, jurors found Dzhokhar Tsarnaev guilty on all counts in the Boston Marathon bombing. The verdict isn't surprising. What might be, however, is the answer to how we prevent this kind of violence from happening again. Because there could be other more young men just like him, which means the lessons we take from Boston will affect whether we can keep America and Americans safer. Today, nearly 1 out of 4 people in the world are Muslim. By 2050, Pew reports, that will be some 1 out of 3. By 2070? Well, I'll quote the all-caps headline reprinted by the Drudge Report: "Muslims to outnumber Christians!" Many Americans read such numbers and worry: Will this mean more Dzhokhar Tsarnaevs? But that's only if you believe Islam causes extremism, which many have argued. And that's wrong, of course. On the other hand, there are people who claim Islam has nothing to do with terrorism. Which is true — and false. Sure, the Islamic faith forbids murder, but there's a small but significant minority of Muslims murdering people in terrible ways, and in Islam's name. Understanding what leads young Muslims like Dzhokhar down a dangerous path requires we understand radicalization. At any given moment in the Middle East, we have little idea who's going to attack whom next, who's on whom's side, how this is going to end, or what anyone's even fighting over anymore. This bad news is going to turn worse before it gets better. But it will get better. To understand why, we have to take a stab at understanding what radicalizes Muslims. Contrary to common belief, Muslims aren't unusually predisposed to violence. Radical Islam, which has taken on an ugly life of its own, began at the intersection of politics, religion and religious identity. Islam is about what you believe, but it's also about being part of a community. And what happens when you are a member of a community and you see it under attack? Some Muslims who have turned to violence have done so with good intentions (the road to hell, after all). Consider: The tragedy of modern Islam is in its endless sequence of tragedies. Before my time, the brutal Soviet invasion of Afghanistan horrified many Muslims. When I was in high school, Bosnia occupied all our attention. There was of course Russia's brutal war on the Chechen people — Dzhokhar shares his name with a recent Chechen patriot --  and Israel's ongoing occupation of the Palestinian territories. And the blows against Muslims don't end there. There was Serbia's war on Kosovo, another war in Chechnya, the invasion of Iraq, oppression in Myanmar, civil strife in Syria, the colonization of East Turkestan, massacres of Muslims in the Central African Republic, wars on a besieged Gaza and West Bank still under Israeli rule. Imagine how this looks to a restless young Muslim. Countless places where co-religionists have been killed, and nobody seems to do anything about it. Nobody even wants to. Extremists have long offered crude reasons for why the violence was happening, and then moved quickly to a single, tempting, terrible response: Take up arms — and kill. In her new book, "Heretic: Why Islam Needs a Reformation Now", Ayaan Hirsi Ali argues that extremism isn't caused by political circumstances, but by Islam itself. Her conclusion is wrong. To fight extremism, we don't need to reform Islam. We need to show young Muslims that extremism is doing the opposite of what it claimed to. Rather than help Muslims, it's harming them. When I was a teenager, our Massachusetts mosque hosted a delegation from Bosnia that shared graphic, heartbreaking stories of rape, exile, and massacre inflicted on Muslims, all because of their faith. The mosque raised money, collected food, blankets, medicine. Promises were made to provide more, and regularly. But we all knew that wasn't enough. As we left the mosque, my peers and I were disgruntled and confused. Shocked. Angry. Our teachers could've told us: Go and fight. Defend your Muslim brothers and sisters who are under siege. Or they could've told us to keep our heads down and make money and live comfortably. Neither answer would have satisfied. Fortunately for us, they offered us a third way. They showed us, patiently, how to work with others, how to compromise, how to get things done. A more engaged American Muslim community, they explained, could use its resources to help people suffering all around the world. They were right. We saw the dead-end road of radicalism from afar, but we also saw, up close, how communities that isolated themselves and turned inward found themselves powerless, ineffectual and ignored. Thanks to social media, a medium that the world's burgeoning young Muslim population is increasingly comfortable with, more Muslims can and will see this, too. Radicalism will be done in by fellow Muslims who want to save their religion from this monster within it.  It's happening already. Our national conversation about Islam is focused on the wrong issues. Does Islam need a Reformation? What in Islam causes violence?  We would do a lot better if we accepted that Muslims the world over have real grievances — dictatorships, corruption, foreign intervention, religious illiteracy, lack of economic opportunity -- and radicals exploit these. We need to show the young Dzhokhars that, if they want to help, then violence isn't going to help. To fight extremism, we need to pose this question to young Muslims: "Do you want to help your brothers and sisters in faith?"   Because those who claim to be defending us are making things so much worse. Their narrative has failed. Their solution is bankrupt. The Caliph wears no clothes. It's the reason why increasing numbers of Muslims reject extremism -- and not just because our numbers are increasing.

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence. The article discusses the issue of radicalization of young Muslims and how it leads to violence, citing the example of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the Boston Marathon bomber, and argues that the solution lies in showing young Muslims that violence is not

Article: Jordan Morris scored early in the second half and Juan Agudelo added his first international goal in four years as the United States beat Mexico. Morris, a 20-year-old thought to be the first university student to make the US side in at least two decades, pounced on a ball that ricocheted off defender Mario Osuna in the 49th minute and beat goalkeeper Cirilo Saucedo from close range. Agudelo replaced Morris in the 65th and scored seven minutes later with a low shot from just outside the penalty area, his third international goal and first since March 2011. Jordan Morris celebrates firing USA ahead early in the second half. Morris is the first university student to be picked by USA in two decades. Juan Agudelo is mobbed by team-mates after he scored his first international goal since 2011. Agudelo replaced Morris in the 65th minute and scored seven minutes later. Michael Bradley made a long pass from midfield and Agudelo controlled it just outside the area. He cut inside with half a dozen touches and beat Saucedo to the near post with a low shot from 19 yards. It was the third international goal for Agudelo and first since March 2011. Playing his second international match since November 2012 and his first since March last year, he dropped to his knees and was mobbed by a group of teammates. The US has beaten Mexico by 2-0 in four straight home World Cup qualifiers, all in Columbus, Ohio. Jurgen Klinsmann played a mix a young players and experienced internationals in the win over Mexico. United States fans turn out in force to watch their side in San Antonio, Texas. With the U.S. looking ahead to this summer's CONCACAF Gold Cup, Jurgan Klinsmann mixed a squad of veterans and young players. Morris, who trained with the national team last May and made his debut at Ireland in November, started because captain Clint Dempsey is sidelined by a hamstring injury and Jozy Altidore was serving a one-game suspension for a red card. Mexico's best chance came late in the first half when Eduardo Herrera ran into the penalty area and poked a low cross past goalkeeper Nick Rimando into the side netting. El Tri had complained about the field conditions on Tuesday and by game time the grass was uneven, with large brown and dirt patches causing players to slip and stumble several times.

Article: (CNN)It's a good thing -- a lucky thing -- that a bystander had the courage and presence of mind to record the shocking video that shows a white police officer, Michael Slager, gunning down and killing an apparently unarmed black man named Walter Scott after a traffic stop in North Charleston, South Carolina. And the resulting national wave of revulsion and indignation -- along with the prompt arrest of Slager on murder charges -- is a welcome and appropriate response. But the event raises broad, troubling questions about how often such incidents take place without the benefit of a third-party recording. It's not supposed to be a mystery: More than 20 years ago, Congress approved a law, the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, signed by President Bill Clinton, that requires the federal Justice Department to collect data on deaths caused by police. The law has never truly been implemented, leaving us with patchy information about particular episodes rather than a comprehensive sense of how race and policing play out in America. "What happened here today doesn't happen all the time. What if there was no video? What if there was no witness -- or hero, as I call him -- to come forward?" said L. Chris Stewart, an attorney for Scott's family. "As you can see, the initial (police) reports stated something totally different." That's putting it mildly. In early police statements -- issued before the video came to light -- Slager reportedly said that Scott attacked him, that he fired only after a scuffle and that cops made medical efforts to revive Scott. The video makes hash of those claims, and likely contributed to Slager's swift arrest and pending murder charges. "When you're wrong, you're wrong," said North Charleston Mayor Keith Summey. That leaves Slager to face murder charges that could land him on death row -- and the rest of us to face a disturbing reality. I'm all for having police use body cameras, although they are not a magic cure for preventing or stopping the excessive use of force. But the much bigger problem is that we simply don't know when and where police killings take place, or whether they cluster in particular cities or states. And that means we don't know for certain whether unjustified or excessive force correlates with particular forms of officer training or detectable underlying racial bias. We don't even know the role played by officers operating under stressful conditions or while dealing with mental or physical illness. These vital questions aren't supposed to be a mystery. According to Section 210402 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, "The Attorney General shall, through appropriate means, acquire data about the use of excessive force by law enforcement officers.... The Attorney General shall publish an annual summary of the data acquired under this section." That section of the law has effectively been ignored, beyond a first attempt at a comprehensive report published in 1996. By 2001, a New York Times article noted that when it comes to police uses of deadly force, "No comprehensive accounting for all of the nation's 17,000 police department exists." There are multiple reasons the law has been ignored. Collecting information from the nation's thousands of jurisdictions -- the myriad villages, counties and cities -- is a tough, expensive assignment. The job is even harder because many police departments, reluctant to air their dirty laundry, fail to distinguish between justified and unjustified killings on the reasonable grounds that it's up to the courts to rule on whether an officer has committed brutality -- something that's often established only after years of court proceedings. These hurdles could be overcome by a determined effort from Washington, but Congress has failed to press the Justice Department to demand the data and comply with the 1994 law. A weak substitute called the Death in Custody Reporting Act was passed in 2000 and renewed in 2014, but it is a voluntary reporting program intended to coax information out of local departments. Some of the data gap has been filled by media organizations -- and what they have discovered only underscores the need for muscular, mandatory enforcement of the data-gathering law. In 2011, the Las Vegas Review-Journal published an extensive investigation of police killings in and around Las Vegas and found 378 shootings over a 20-year period, 142 of which were fatal. In no case was an officer convicted or even fired because of an on-duty shooting. In South Carolina last month, The State newspaper published an examination of 209 instances in which officers shot at suspects, and found that only a handful of officers were charged, and none found guilty. "In South Carolina, it remains exceedingly rare for an officer to be found at fault criminally for shooting at someone," the Columbia newspaper concluded. A group of activists has created a website called MappingPoliceViolence.org that flags cases of police killings; its estimate that at least 304 black people were killed by police in 2014 may stand as the best guess we have about the dimensions of a national problem. But we shouldn't be guessing. As the Las Vegas Review-Journal editorialized in 2011: "How many lives might be saved if taxpayers everywhere were better informed about police shootings? How can they know about a potential local problem without information?... Police already track everything from domestic violence to child abuse to murder, and police routinely lobby state and federal lawmakers to put new crimes into statute. The budgetary impact of adding another reporting category to local police forces would be minuscule. The social impact of such an addition, however, would be huge." That common-sense observation is being echoed by the Obama administration -- specifically, the President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing, created in December in response to widespread protests following the police killings of unarmed black men including Michael Brown and Eric Garner. The recently released interim report of the task force calls, one more time, for the Justice Department to collect comprehensive data from local departments. But it will take more pressure -- from activists, victims' families, members of Congress and President Barack Obama himself -- to demand an end to the stonewalling of information. It's long past time we got to the truth of how many more killings like Walter Scott's are happening without a video to set the record straight.

Article: Buoyant after their strong domestic performance last week, Paris St Germain will look to overcome the absence of key players including striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic in Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final first leg against Barcelona. PSG beat Ligue 1 bitter rivals Olympique de Marseille 3-2, thrashed St Etienne 4-1 in the French Cup semi-finals, and won the League Cup final 4-0 against Bastia on Saturday. Even if they will be without the suspended Ibrahimovic and Marco Verratti and the injured David Luiz, PSG believe they are peaking. Paris Saint-Germain will be without the suspended Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Marco Verratti against Barcelona. 'Do I feel a new momentum? It's been the case for a while. We worked physically (during the winter break) and today, in money time, we're good,' said coach Laurent Blanc. 'We are gaining momentum while last year at the same time we were on the way down.' Both teams have been meeting regularly recently in the Champions League, with PSG beating Barca 3-2 at home in a Group F game this season before losing 3-1 at the Camp Nou. The Ligue 1 Champions will also have to cope without the injured David Luiz against the La Liga giants. Barca had reached the semi-finals in 2013 by eliminating PSG on away goals, drawing 1-1 at home after a 2-2 stalemate in Paris. 'The quarter-final tie is going to be very different from the group stage. There is a lot more at stake and in football no game is ever the same,' former Barca and PSG winger Ludovic Giuly said. Barca's 2-2 draw at Sevilla in La Liga on Saturday, when they threw away a 2-0 lead, prompted renewed concerns about their defensive frailty, with both the concedded goals down to mistakes from the Barca rearguard. Goalkeeper Claudio Bravo made an uncharacteristic handling error to let in Ever Banega's long-range strike before halftime and centre back Gerard Pique's loss of possession in midfield led to the Andalusian club's late equaliser. Brazilian right back Dani Alves is suspended for the Champions League clash with the Ligue 1 outfit. The stalemate in Sevilla meant Barca's lead over second-placed Real Madrid at the top of La Liga was cut to two points but they remain on course to repeat the 2009 historic treble of Champions League and Spanish league and Cup. Barca's Brazil right back Dani Alves is suspended for Wednesday's game, with Adriano or Martin Montoya likely to replace him in the starting lineup. Pique, however, is unfazed as Barca would once again bank on their formidable attacking trio. 'I've never before seen a relationship like the one between Luis (Suarez), Ney (Neymar) and Leo (Messi). We're talking about three of the best players in the world,' he said. The second leg will be played at the Camp Nou on April 21.

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence.
PSG take on Barcelona in the Champions League quarter-final first leg. But Ligue 1 leaders will be without a trio of key players for the fixture. Zlatan Ibrahimovic, David Luiz and Marco Verratti are all missing. La Liga giants Barcelona will be without Dani Alves for the clash in Paris.

Article: (CNN)The new emojis are here! On Thursday, Apple released a new version of its mobile operating system that includes more diversity than ever when it comes to the race, ethnicity and sexual orientation of its emojis -- those cute little images that users can insert into text messages or emails when words alone just won't cut it. The reaction to this new lineup is, as should be expected with almost anything new in today's hypersensitive climate, a range of cheers and jeers. Why is any of this important, you may ask? For many, these images are far more than tiny clip art for texting. Rather they are seen as recognition that their own ethnicity, sexual orientation, race or even hair color is part of mainstream America -- despite what others might say. This matters in a digital age where texting is how most people communicate and represent themselves dozens -- if not hundreds -- of times every day. Think receiving a text of an image of a person smiling. Or more accurately, think of a white face smiling because up until Thursday's update, all the emojis had pale skin. But that has all changed. Now there's a range of emoji skin tones to pick from, including yellow, brown and black.  I'm sure few people will be upset with this development. But how about in December? Why? Now that will be able to choose the skin tones for each human emoji, and that will also include... Santa Claus. That shrieking sound you may have heard was from Fox News' Megyn Kelly, who famously stated in 2013 that Santa Claus is absolutely, definitely and without a doubt a white guy.  In fact, thanks to Apple, we may even see Brown Santa emojis this December. (Could that mean he's a Muslim Santa?! Cue even more shrieking from Fox News.) There is more. Apple has now given us gay and lesbian couple emojis, kissing with a heart over their heads. This inclusiveness was cheered by at least one gay news service on Twitter. It's not yet clear if a person who likes to use same-sex kissing emoji couples can be denied service by a person who objects on grounds of "religious liberty." But it would be interesting to hear what any of the 2016 GOP presidential candidates might have to say about "gay emojis." And I would predict some conservative will claim that the kissing gay emojis will turn children gay. The fact is, when you embrace diversity, you will still leave out other minority groups. Redheads, for example, are pretty pissed off because there are no emojis featuring their hair color. In fact, supporters of a redheaded emoji have started a petition that has already garnered several thousand signatures. Even expanding the flags represented by emojis, as Apple has done, comes at some peril. Apparently Canada is overjoyed that finally Apple has included it. But Armenians are not happy they were left out. I must admit that being partially of Palestinian heritage, it's heartening to see that despite the fact that some refuse to recognize a Palestinian state, Apple has chosen to now include a Palestinian flag emoji. Armenia, I feel your pain. Of course the bigger question in the whole diverse-emoji issue is: What took Apple so long? How hard could it have been to add different skin colors to pick from? That the company (finally) did is a step in the right direction: America's demographics are changing, so our representations of who we are -- even representations as tiny as emojis -- should reflect this. Apple has "evolved" in showing diversity -- from brown people to same-sex couples. Maybe "religious liberty" conservatives who discriminate will follow.

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence. Apple has released a new version of its mobile operating system that includes more diverse emojis, including different skin tones, gay and lesbian couple emojis, and new flag emojis, in an effort to promote inclusivity and

Article: Leeds Rhinos have sent full back Zak Hardaker on an anger management course after a student was left with two black eyes and bruising during a violent incident in February. Hardaker was at the centre of a police assault probe into an attack on a 22-year-old man at student flats in Leeds, but was not charged with any offence. Leeds issued a lengthy statement outlining Hardaker's punishment, which will also see him forfeit one month's salary to be donated to a local charity and do up to 20 hours a week of voluntary work for the club's foundation for the duration of his contract. Hardaker and team-mate Elliot Minchella both paid £200 in compensation and wrote a letter of apology to a 22-year-old man following a police investigation but Leeds said Hardaker's punishment is far stronger 'given his previous misconduct'. Leeds Rhinos have sent full back Zak Hardaker (centre with the ball) on an anger management course. The one-cap England international received a five-match ban and a fine for a homophobic comment made last year and was also fined by England for breaching team discipline during the 2013 World Cup. The statement from Leeds read: 'The club has accepted his apology for his actions, however, given his previous misconduct, Zak has realised that it is his actions rather than his words that must now show his intentions to put these events behind him.' It went on: 'We have passed the point of telling him what he has to do, however, for the first time Zak has admitted to us and, more importantly to himself, that he has an issue with aspects of his lifestyle which he wants to improve. 'We have listened to what he has committed to do for himself and we will support him.' Minchella received a written warning and a fine of 50 per cent of his monthly salary, while team-mates Rob Mulhern, Josh Walters and Ash Handley were fined and issued verbal warnings. Police said the student received two black eyes and a bruised neck during the incident. Hardaker received a five-match ban and a fine for a homophobic comment made last year. Leeds Rhinos have today issued the following statement relating to an incident which happened in the city earlier this year that was brought into the public spotlight:. 'The Leeds Rhinos Players Code of Conduct prohibits players from visiting licensed premises after midnight without prior permission from me or the Head Coach. Our investigation has revealed this regulation was breached by five players on a midweek evening before the start of this season. Furthermore Zak Hardaker and Elliot Minchella were involved in an incident at a student accommodation building, which led to a police investigation and a written apology from both players to a student and a £200 compensation payment from Hardaker and Minchella. 'Our internal investigation has now concluded. It has been an exhaustive process and we are always disappointed when players fall below the standards we expect of them and let everyone else down. The players themselves are embarrassed and very apologetic and I am sure it has been a lesson learned for all involved. 'Rob Mulhern, Josh Walters and Ash Handley have each received a fine and a verbal warning. Elliot Minchella has received a written warning and a fine of 50% of his monthly salary. 'With regard to Zak Hardaker, the club has accepted his apology for his actions, however, given his previous misconduct, Zak has realized that it is his actions rather than his words that must now show his intentions to put these events behind him. Therefore, we have agreed the following actions:. 1) Zak will forfeit one months salary and this will be donated to support a local charity project. 2) He will enroll on a course for anger management. 3) Zak will work as a volunteer for up to 20 hours a week for the duration of his Rhinos contract to assist the Leeds Rhinos Foundation and Marketing Department. 'Zak is full of passion and enthusiasm and has many qualities that are to be admired in a young player but a small part of him has led to problems and this has to be addressed, not only for the image of the game but most importantly for Zak’s own well being and his ability to fulfil his potential. We have passed the point of telling him what he has to do, however, for the first time Zak has admitted to us and, more importantly to himself, that he has an issue with aspects of his lifestyle which he wants to improve. We have listened to what he has committed to do for himself and we will support him.'

Article: (CNN)Hillary Clinton finally answered the question we've all been asking for years: Will she run for president in 2016? With official news of her candidacy just hours old, one thing is already crystal clear: For the next year and a half, Clinton will be the barometer by which we assess gender equality in the United States. Win or lose, this creates a burden for her that no male candidate will ever have to shoulder. Just consider the two potential outcomes. A win would mean a woman in the White House, which is a vital step in the march toward women's full political inclusion. But it's possible that the march will end right there. We'll break our arms patting ourselves on the back for how far we've come. We'll raise the "Mission Accomplished" banner over the women's movement. And we'll call it a day. Granted, 80% of elected officials throughout the country will still be men. Women will continue to be less likely than men even to consider running for office. And pay inequities, sexual assault and human trafficking will persist as challenges that no one person can solve, no matter how hard Clinton might try. "But we've elected a woman as president," we'll say. Let her take care of it. A loss would be even more difficult. Clinton will be blamed for running a subpar campaign regardless of how brilliant her strategy is. More generally, her loss would perpetuate the myth that women cannot win big elections, that the electoral environment is rife with bias and discrimination, and that women must be twice as good to get half as far. "If Hillary Clinton can't win an election," potential female candidates will ask, "How can I?" Extrapolating from one female candidate's experiences to women in politics more broadly is always suspect. But in the case of Clinton, it is particularly flawed for at least two fundamental reasons. First, Clinton is no ordinary female presidential candidate, if there is such a thing. She began the 2008 race with levels of name recognition that many candidates never achieve, and she is even more well-known today. But that means that she also enters the electoral arena with 23 years of public accomplishments and 23 years of well-publicized baggage. Voters, donors, journalists and pundits all hold clear impressions of Clinton before she ever eats a corn dog in Iowa, steps onto a debate stage in New Hampshire or takes a shot of bourbon in Kentucky. Too often, we treat Clinton's loss to Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic primary as a referendum on how citizens feel about electing women to positions of political power. In reality, what people knew about Hillary Clinton likely shaped their views of Hillary Clinton. Widespread sexism and misogyny likely did not. After all, for decades, women who have run for office have performed just as well as men. They win elections at equal rates and routinely raise comparable amounts of money. Do some voters still question women's suitability as leaders? Of course they do. But these attitudes, which have become increasingly rare, do not translate into systematic biases against female candidates. Second, presidential politics is, first and foremost, a partisan affair. The D or R in front of the candidates' names -- not the X or Y chromosomes in their DNA -- tells us about how more than 90% of the population will vote. Party polarization has essentially rendered the importance of sex on the campaign trail far less relevant than might otherwise be the case. Now, I'll be the first to predict that by the middle of the week, we will be able to assemble a reel of sexist comments uttered by pundits, and we will be one mouse click away from a steady stream of misogynistic memes, photos and captions that have taken hold on social media. The Clinton campaign will once again have to determine which incidents to address, which to ignore and how to preempt future episodes. I don't want to diminish the problems associated with this type of behavior or the fact that it is inappropriate, disrespectful and appalling. And incorporating these concerns into a broad campaign strategy is likely something that male candidates won't need to consider. But men yelling "Iron my shirt" at a campaign rally, cable news pundits associating Clinton with their ex-wives outside of probate court and manufacturers producing Hillary Clinton nutcrackers do not change the fact that when it comes to presidential elections, partisanship and the state of the economy tell us almost everything we need to know. If Clinton wins the race, it will be because it was a good year for Democrats. And if she loses, it will be because the GOP developed a winning message. But how much does any of this really matter? Sure, voters are amenable to electing women. Any Democratic nominee would face the same electoral landscape. The problems confronting women in society are just as grave regardless of who occupies the White House. And inferring too much from Hillary Clinton's experiences is a risky endeavor. Yet the minute Clinton announced her candidacy, she became the official litmus test for true gender equality in the United States. That's a label that no female candidate should have to wear. Let the burden begin.

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence. Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign will serve as a barometer for gender equality in the US, with her potential win or loss having significant implications for women in politics and

Article: Inter Milan have opened discussions with Manchester City about Stevan Jovetic. The Serie A club have proposed an initial loan deal for the forward but City are unwilling to let him leave on a temporary basis. Jovetic looks likely to leave the Etihad this summer after being omitted from the club's Champions League squad earlier this season to make room for January signing Wilfried Bony. Inter Milan have opened talks with Manchester City regarding a deal for forward Stevan Jovetic. Jovetic, pictured scoring against Sunderland in December, looks likely to leave the Etihad this summer. Inter Milan boss Roberto Mancini is hoping to raid his former club Manchester City this summer. The Premier League champions rejected several bids from Inter last summer, while Juventus showed interest in the Montenegro star during the last transfer window. City are willing to listen to offers for Jovetic if they can recoup a significant amount of the £22million they paid Fiorentina for him in 2013. Inter are unlikely to turn Lukas Podolski's loan move from Arsenal into a permanent one, leaving Roberto Mancini in the market for a wide forward. The former City boss also remains keen on a deal for Yaya Toure, who could be one of several players to leave the Premier League champions this summer. Inter are also interested in a deal for midfielder Yaya Toure, pictured celebrating a goal against Sunderland. Veteran midfielder Toure, pictured in action against Newcastle, is one of a number of players who could leave. Speaking earlier this month, Mancini said: 'Yaya has played in every top League, apart from Germany and Italy. 'If, as it seems, he wants to have an experience in Italy, then there is this possibility he could come here. 'It won’t be easy, but he’s a player with incredible technique and character. Would Inter be his first choice? That’s certain.'

Inter Milan have asked Manchester City about loaning Stevan Jovetic. City are willing to listen to cash offers for the former Fiorentina star. Roberto Mancini is also keen on a deal for City midfielder Yaya Toure. He believes Toure would choose to join Inter if he leaves City this summer.

Article: Robbie Williams has scaled back plans to revamp his multi-million pound home following a public spat with neighbour Jimmy Page. The 41-year-old star has ditched the proposal for a two-storey basement extension under the garden and glass studio at the top of his house. The Take That singer angered the veteran Led Zeppelin rocker with ambitious proposals for the 46-room mansion, which was previously owned by the late film director Michael Winner. Neighbours: The homes of Robbie Williams (left) and Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page (right). Williams has submitted fresh plans to extend his mansion having angered the veteran rocker with an earlier proposal. Williams responded by withdrawing the blueprints but has now returned with a fresh set of plans. After ditching the underground extension, the focus now is on the inside of the property, which he bought for £17.5million in 2013 and includes a swimming pool. Williams wants to lower some of the floors and knock down a number of the walls to create bigger rooms and doorways. One of the walls earmarked for demolition by the pop star is between his lounge and home cinema. The application reads: 'The proposed alterations have been considered in regard to a holistic programme of contemporary family living that will ensure the long term occupation and appropriate use of the place into the future.' Scrapped: Pop singer Williams has ditched the proposal for a two-storey super basement extension (pictured) under the garden and glass studio at the top of his house. New blueprints: Williams wants to focus instead on the inside of the property, which he bought for £17.5million in 2013 and includes a swimming pool. Spat: Williams (left) and Page (right) have been locked in a battle not over chart position but instead whether the pop star should get the green light for his plans to expand his mansion. Somewhere to cool off: Williams' home included a swimming pool when he bought it. He wanted to build a new one in an underground extension but has since backtracked on the idea. Rocker Jimmy Page was upset that building work in Williams' garden (pictured) would cause disruption to the neighbourhood. He claimed the work could damage his property, built in the 1870s by Victorian architect. The plans have been submitted to Kensington and Chelsea Council and also include the demolition and rebuilding of the garage. Williams lives at the property with his wife, U.S. television actress Ayda Field, and their two children. Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page, who lives next door house, hired a team of experts to help him rebuff the couple's original plans. He claimed the work could damage his property, which was built in the 1870s by Victorian architect William Bruges. Family man: Williams lives with his wife, U.S. television actress Ayda Field, and their two children. The plans submitted to Kensington and Chelsea Council include the demolition and rebuilding of the mansion's garage.

The Take That star wants to lower some of the floors and knock down a number of the walls to create bigger rooms and doorways. One of the walls earmarked for demolition is between his lounge and home cinema. Going deeper underground: The previous proposal Williams submitted included an underground extension. High ceilings and old fireplaces can be seen in Williams' home in this picture taken when Winner lived there. Page also raised fears that they would be able to peer into his house, where he has lived since 1972. Writing to town hall planners, Page argued: 'I am extremely concerned that this work will cause vibrations and possible structural damage with my house' He added: 'As you will know, it is listed Grade I and is thus one of the most important buildings in the borough.' Another neighbour, the Marks and Spencer heir Jonathan Sieff, was also upset by the plans and objected. Rock royalty: Page wanted to make sure he protected his property, which includes this imposing fireplace below a medieval scene, so hired a team of experts to help him rebuff Williams' original plans. Design: The Led Zeppelin guitarist's Grade 1 listed tower has intricate paintwork featured heavily inside. Not on the same wavelength: Jimmy Page wrote to town hall planners: 'I am extremely concerned that this work will cause vibrations and possible structural damage with my house'. Pictured are Williams' old plans. Revised: This is what the new plan looks like. It has been submitted to Kensington and Chelsea Council.

Article: London (CNN)The Pentagon released a map this week showing coalition forces have taken back 25-30% of Iraqi territory seized by ISIS. The map, above, shows gains in key central and northern areas of Iraq where the terror group was previously the dominant force. The gains made in the fight against the terror group by Iraqi security forces and coalition air power certainly look impressive -- although as the U.S. Department of Defense acknowledges it's a dynamic conflict and territory can change hands depending on "daily fluctuations in the battle lines." So, how exactly should we read this information? What does it say about the wider fight against ISIS? CNN asked Afzal Ashraf, a counterinsurgency specialist and consulting fellow at the Royal United Services Institute to give us a steer on what this new data tells us about the fight against ISIS in Iraq. Below is an edited version of the conversation. CNN: So, is the tide turning in Iraq -- is the coalition winning? Afzal Ashraf: When it comes to insurgencies it's always problematic to think about the tide turning in terms of territorial gains because insurgencies by their very nature are extremely good at adapting to change. The one difference between ISIS and insurgencies in general is that ISIS declared itself a state, a caliphate once had territory so any loss is very strategic loss of prestige and image for them. (There have been) significant gains against ISIS -- particularly in Tikrit -- and it's no coincidence we've seen ISIS make spectacular attacks in refugee centers in Syria. It's asymmetric warfare, they know they cannot hold conventional force back for very long so what they do is they withdraw... then take initiative elsewhere. They have to distract attention from those losses by gains and attacks elsewhere. It continues their image of initiative, of shocking, of reshaping the world -- which is what they are trying to do. CNN: What does the map tell us about the coalition's strategy? AA: It's very telling. There are losses but most of the losses are around the edges of their territory and what that means is a very conventional push forward by the Iraqi forces. It's a push against the front line of ISIS rather than being brave and creative and going in behind ISIS's lines and breaking it up. What this isn't is using maneuverist warfare -- which is a military philosophy that exploits the capabilities of conventional forces to project power by using air forces to take land along main supply routes and put friendly forces on that land to cut land into chunks which causes massive disruption to command and control and their supply chains which can cause forces to collapse much more rapidly than a frontal push. The capability you need (for this kind of warfare) is much more high-tech than the capabilities the Iraqis have. Those capabilities are available in the region -- Jordanians, Egyptians and other forces have helicopters and aircraft -- and it's very interesting that the Middle Eastern nations have not developed an effective coalition to target ISIS which is an existential threat. CNN: What about Ramadi? ISIS seems to be winning there. AA: Ramadi has been a potential battlefield for the past decade. But in this context (ISIS) will... be pushing in Ramadi because that's an area they have lots of support. It also diverts their attention away from losses to their gains. The concept of success is hugely important to them -- it's what sustains the recruitment effort of ISIS. Nobody wants to join a bunch of losers, so it's very important for them to be seen to be succeeding. Above all this is a rhetorical war that is being fought deliberately in the media. They are losing so of course they are going to try to distract us by destroying ancient statues in Nimrud and killing refugees in camps like Yarmouk. But where it counts they are not standing and fighting.

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence. The Pentagon has released a map showing that coalition forces have taken back 25-30% of Iraqi territory previously controlled by ISIS, with gains in central and northern areas, but counterinsurgency specialist Afzal Ashraf notes that

Article: (CNN)Arsenal kept their slim hopes of winning this season's English Premier League title alive by beating relegation threatened Burnley 1-0 at Turf Moor. A first half goal from Welsh international Aaron Ramsey was enough to separate the two sides and secure Arsenal's hold on second place. More importantly it took the north London club to within four points of first placed Chelsea, with the two clubs to play next week. But Chelsea have two games in hand and play lowly Queens Park Rangers on Sunday, a team who are themselves struggling against relegation. Good form. Arsenal have been in superb form since the start of the year, transforming what looked to be another mediocre season struggling to secure fourth place -- and with it Champions League qualification -- into one where they at least have a shot at winning the title. After going ahead, Arsenal rarely looked in any danger of conceding, showing more of the midfield pragmatism epitomized by the likes of Francis Coquelin, who also played a crucial role in the goal. "He has been absolutely consistent in the quality of his defensive work," Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger told Sky Sports after the game when asked about Coquelin's contribution to Arsenal's current run. They have won eight games in a  row since introducing the previously overlooked young Frenchman into a more defensive midfield position. "He was a player who was with us for seven years, from 17, he's now just 24," Wenger explained. "Sometimes you have to be patient. I am very happy for him because he has shown great mental strength." Now all eyes will be on next week's clash between Arsenal and Chelsea which will likely decide the title. "They have the games in hand," said Wenger, playing down his club's title aspirations. "But we'll keep going and that's why the win was so important for us today." Relegation dogfight. Meanwhile it was a good day for teams at the bottom of the league. Aston Villa continued their good form since appointing coach Tim Sherwood with a 1-0 victory over Tottenham, who fired Sherwood last season. Belgian international Christian Benteke scored the only goal of the game, his eighth in six matches, to secure a vital three points to give the Midlands club breathing space. Another Midlands club looking over their shoulder is West Brom, who conceded an injury time goal to lose 3-2 against bottom club Leicester City. But it was an awful day for Sunderland's former Dutch international coach Dick Advocaat, who saw his team lose 4-1 at home against form team Crystal Palace. Democratic Republic of Congo international Yannick Bolasie scored Crystal Palace's first ever hat trick in the Premier League to secure an easy victory.

Article: The mother of the police officer who was caught on video shooting an unarmed black man in the back as he was running away has broken her silence. Karen Sharpe, the mother of North Charleston Police Officer Michael Slager, defended her son in an interview, saying she cannot believe that he would do anything like what he's accused of. She also revealed that his wife, who is eight months pregnant, is devastated. Ms Sharpe said that she will never watch the video footage of the fatal shooting. This as she also expressed her sympathy for Walter Scott's family, the man her son shot dead. Scroll down for video. Karen Sharpe (above) the mother of North Charleston Police Officer Michael Slager, defended her son in an interview. This as Slager (mugshot left, force photo right) is behind bars and has been fired from his job, though he has yet to enter a plea. Sharpe (above) said she has not watched the video of the shooting or read any news reports or watched any news coverage of the incident - and doesn't plan to. Sharpe also expressed sympathy for Walter Scott's (above) family, noting this event has caused them both to 'change forever' 'I just can't,' Sharpe told ABC News. 'Maybe to some people, "Well, you're being in denial," but I'm sorry I just can't. I just - I know how Michael is.' She went on to say her son loved being an officer. 'I can't imagine him doing something, it's just not like him,' she said of the shooting. 'That's just not his character. It's not.' As for Slager's wife, she said that earlier that day the two women had to go for a checkup together to see how her baby is doing. 'She was just so sad because he was not there and I know that he would not do something purposeful to not be able to be with his wife during the delivery,' Sharpe said of the doctor's appointment. 'They just tried so hard for this.' She then added; 'He has a little baby on the way, due next month, and they worked so hard for this baby.' The city had previously stated it would continue paying for Mrs. Slager's health insurance until she gives birth. Ms Sharpe also spoke about the Scott family as she said; 'Their life will never be the same again and my life will never be the same again. 'Even though they're not the same things that have happened, I know there are changes in both their family and my family... and that's the part that bothers me. They've changed forever.' Ultimately, she is putting her trust in her faith, and refuses to believe that she might never see her son a free man again. 'I just have to let it be and hope God takes care of everybody involved -- not only my family but the Scott's family - because I know they're grieving just like I'm grieving,' she said. The shooting death of Scott by Slager occurred on Saturday morning. At the time, Slager said that Scott was going for his Taser and that he used necessary force. Video footage taken by an eyewitness soon refuted Slager's claims. Then, when asked about the video footage and if she had seen it yet, Sharpe said:  'No I have not and I have purposely not watched it.' She continued: 'I have purposely not heard people's comments about it. I just, I can't watch it.' She also said she is avoiding reading the papers of watching the news. 'I know who Michael is,' she explained. 'And I don't know what is being portrayed of him because I haven't listened to them, but he's a very good person.' Slager was charged with Scott's murder on Tuesday and could face the death penalty. He was terminated from the North Charleston police department the following day, with Chief Eddie Riggers telling a press conference that he had watched the video and found it'sickening'. Slager has not entered a plea to the murder charge nor commented publicly on the killing last Saturday. This after the shooting was caught on camera by an eyewitness. Slager had reported that Scott was going for his Taser at the time, a claim the video footage refuted. He claimed to have stopped the man for a broken brake light.

Article: (CNN)I'm haunted by the video of Officer Michael Slager firing eight shots at Walter Scott as he fled his encounter with North Charleston police -- his back turned to the officer. What I find more disturbing is how the officer cuffs the fallen Scott and allows him to die face-down in the dirt while Slager appears to plant an item next to his body. I understand why people are skeptical of self-defense claims -- especially from law enforcement. If not for the video taken by a bystander, I can't help but think that this story would be shuttered behind the wall of an active investigation. As a defense attorney, I am more sensitive than anyone to the assumption of innocence for those accused of a crime, but this single piece of evidence -- a video of a man shot in the back while in full retreat -- defies any reasonable explanation. Thank God there was a camera. It will help ensure that justice will be served in this case. However, there is another camera that -- had it been deployed -- might have prevented the entire tragedy: a police body camera. Throughout the entire encounter with Scott, it's clear Slager had no idea someone was filming him. Had he known there would be video of his every move, would he have drawn his weapon on a fleeing man?  Would he have fired?  Eight times?  Would he have misrepresented the encounter on his police report? Of course not. If Slager had been wearing a body camera, Scott would probably still be alive, and Slager wouldn't be facing the possibility of life in prison -- or a possible death sentence. Body cameras are expensive to deploy, sure. And storing the massive amounts of data that body cameras create costs even more. That cost, however -- if we're talking the monetary kind -- may be eclipsed by the punitive damages delivered to Scott's family in an inevitable civil suit against the North Charleston Police Department. Most importantly, we have to ask ourselves this: What's the value of a human life? Certainly it's worth the price of some mass data storage. And there's something else at stake. The public is losing confidence in law enforcement, and the strained relationship between minorities and police is reaching a breaking point. Every police shooting that captures headlines justifies an ever increasing fear of cops in the street. As fear ratchets up, so does the tension between cops and the people in the communities they serve. As tension rises, the risk of more shootings increases. It is a cycle of destruction that could lead to chaos. Police body cameras can help break this cycle. Studies have shown that both cops and people in the community act better when they know they are on camera. Complaints against cops decrease, and, most importantly, use-of-force incidents drop. I will admit that body cameras are only an interim solution. They only help compensate for the real underlying problem, which is this: There is a bias against black men that has infiltrated the criminal justice system, and we are seeing it in the disproportionate shooting of black men. When we look at this footage -- and when we see the dashboard camera from the other South Carolina officer who last year shot a man who was reaching for his driver's license -- it's clear that many cops are more likely to interpret actions, even routine actions, from black men as potentially aggressive. These may not be overtly racist cops. They may not intentionally treat black men differently, but we can't pretend that black men aren't being disproportionately targeted. All across the country, we see it happening, and with the proliferation of video, we're seeing it happen with alarming frequency. Somehow, we're going to have to beat this bias out of our system. Set tougher employment screening standards when hiring cops. Institute more training to help officers recognize the bias and adjust for it. As a society, we have to focus on the broad social changes needed to address disparities in income, education and opportunities -- disparities that keep us a racially divided nation. But social change, sadly, may take generations of hard work. In the meantime, if we can't immediately root out racial bias, we can at least put a bright spotlight on it, and we can start by focusing on the one interaction where racial bias results in the loss of life -- we can start by placing body-mounted cameras on cops.

Article: Jack Nicklaus recorded his first ever hole-in-one at the Masters on Wednesday, as Camilo Villegas fired two in the space of five holes but still could not win the traditional par-three contest. Villegas holed out on the fourth and eighth as he finished alongside Kevin Streelman on five under par, only to find water on the eighth when he played it again as the third play-off hole. Kevin Streelman holds his trophy aloft after winning the Par-3 Contest on a play-off against Camilo Villegas. Streelman therefore became the latest player to be saddled with the 'curse' of the par-three champion, with no player ever becoming par-three and Masters champion in the same year. However, that was placed firmly into perspective thanks to his 11-year-old caddie Ethan Couch, who has a benign but inoperable brain tumour. Streelman found Couch via the Make-a-Wish Foundation and invited him to be his caddie in the light-hearted curtain-raiser. Augusta National's par-three course traditionally hosts the contest the day before start of the major. 'It was a really fun day, especially to have Ethan with me here,' Streelman said. 'This isn't about me today. It's about helping him out and showing him a great day.' Villegas said: 'I've made a few hole-in-ones, but it's pretty special to make them here. The second one, we were a little more emotional there. We just kind of jumped.' Nicklaus had earlier holed out with an eight iron from 123 yards on the fourth, his ball landing around 15 feet past the pin and spinning back into the hole. Woods played in the Masters par-three contest at Augusta National for the first time in 11 years. That took the 75-year-old six-time champion to three under par, but he would bogey the fifth and hit two balls into the water on the ninth to end his hopes of an unlikely triumph. Former US Open champion Curtis Strange reminded Nicklaus of the tradition that players who make a hole-in-one have to buy the drinks in the clubhouse when Nicklaus walked past the ESPN commentary position. 'Send me a bill,' Nicklaus replied. The Masters official Twitter account shared an image of Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods with Niall Horan. The 18-time major winner added on ESPN: 'I never had a hole in one at Augusta, in the par three (contest) or on the golf course. Doing an interview this morning I said all I have to do is go out there, make a hole-in-one and win the par three. I had it three under and then choked.' Since the contest started in 1960, nobody has ever become par-three and Masters champion in the same week, a fact which sometimes sees players deliberately not shoot the best score possible. Most treat it as light relief and invite family or friends to act as their caddies, including Tiger Woods this year for the first time since 2004. Woods had his children Charlie and Sam on his bag and made sure he could not win the event by getting daughter Sam to tap in for par on the sixth. Jack Nicklaus (centre) with Ben Crenshaw (left) and Gary Player (right) during the Par-3 Contest. 'We had an absolutely great time. These were memories for a lifetime,' said Woods, who was also accompanied by girlfriend Lindsey Vonn. He later added on Twitter: 'I'll always have memories of my pop at Augusta and now Sam & Charlie. An amazing day.' Tournament favourite Rory McIlroy had One Direction singer Niall Horan acting as his caddie and Horan proved he should stick to singing after badly hooking a tee shot on the ninth into the water. 'I apologise to golf,' Horan joked. 'I do perform to a lot of people but we were performing to their parents today! There was a lot of pressure.' McIlroy, who is looking to become the sixth player to complete the career grand slam by winning a first Masters title on Sunday, added: 'I wanted to do this because it's a big week for me and just to go into the tournament in a relaxed mood. To spend a couple of hours like this was fun.'

Kevin Streelman beat Camilo Villegas on third play-off hole at Augusta. Tiger Woods played in the par-three contest for the first time since 2004. Jack Nicklaus recorded his first ever hole-in-one at the Masters.

Article: (CNN)Danny Kahneman, my good friend and co-author who got a Nobel Prize in economics, once helped to run an experiment involving patients undergoing colonoscopies.  One group received a mildly pleasurable experience at the end of the procedure; the other group, which experienced the same type of colonoscopy, did not. It turns out that the group for whom things ended well had significantly more positive recollections of the whole affair from its beginning. The psychology of it is simple to understand: Happy endings matter. Even an unpleasant experience can lead to happy memories in hindsight if it ends well. So too with taxes. Let's just say that when it comes to taxes for the average American, "stuff" happens (keeping the colonoscopy metaphor running), paycheck to tax-reduced paycheck.  But recent statistics suggest that 8 out of 10 American taxpayers get a refund when they file their taxes, and the average amount is close to $3000. That pays for a lot of stuff. To make the good news even better, tax filing has gotten rather simple for most people, with various software and service providers offering to do the dreaded paperwork for free. No filing headaches and a check to boot. What's not to like? The fact of the matter is there is plenty not to like when it comes to the U.S. tax system. For example, the laws are biased against two-worker marriages; taxes go up when two relatively equal earners marry, as the rate brackets for couples are less than double that for single filers. Taxes are also overly complex and essentially optional for the truly rich, who make their wealth off of their existing wealth, the largely untaxed returns from capital, rather than by getting ordinary paychecks like most of us. But now is not the time to explain such serious matters; the people are too busy spending their refunds. The once dreaded Tax Day has become a happy spending spree for most Americans. This state of short-term bliss follows from some deep trends in our tax laws. In brief, the U.S. income tax system is increasingly a wage tax, with limited taxes on capital (what the rich have) and limited deductions for most of us.  For example, 3 out of 4 Americans using a standard deduction get no break for their charitable contributions. All of this has been hashed and rehashed by politicians, professors and pundits. But who has time for that? Let's go to our television sets and check out the commercials. One clever spot ran during the recent Super Bowl, suggesting that the Boston Tea Party -- a tax revolt -- could have been averted with free online filing, which the sponsor was eager to provide. Filling out 1040s was part of what made the income tax so odious for the masses for such a long time -- who doesn't remember our parents fretting over shoeboxes of receipts sometime in April, the cruelest month? Now as Tax Day approaches, we are flooded with advertisements about America getting its billions back, without even having to pay to prepare the forms. We get paid to play! Here is the happy ending that Kahneman and others have shown can mitigate the memories of unpleasantness past. The simple fact is that a simple tax is also rather simple to administer. Service providers kindly offer to help out the masses of befuddled Americans. Of course, these kind souls want their happy endings too. They are betting that once the large refunds become obvious to their customers, the grateful taxpayers-turned-consumers will happily purchase add-on services, such as "audit protection insurance," or perhaps deposit the money in financial accounts managed by the provider. Just as lottery winners notoriously go on impulsive spending sprees, the "found money" of tax returns can finance many nice purchases. Of course, there are still those annoying matters of the deep unfairness of the tax laws, biased against modern families and wage earners, and in favor of the rich living off capital.  No real bother -- stuff happens. Let others fret about fairness. As long as our taxpaying or colon procedures end with a smile -- or a check -- who has time to dwell on the bad stuff that came before?

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence. The article discusses how the US tax system has become more of a wage tax, with limited taxes on capital and limited deductions for most people, and how tax filing has become simpler and even profitable for many Americans through refunds and

Article: (CNN)Even in the horror of Syria's civil war, there are few places that showcase the scale of the destruction -- and the senselessness of the loss of life -- more than the Yarmouk camp on the outskirts of Damascus. Set up as a refugee camp for Palestinians in the 1950s, it slowly evolved into a neighborhood over the years, but since 2012 it has been engulfed in the Syrian conflict. Two weeks ago ISIS fighters stormed Yarmouk, and that made life for those still inside even worse than it was before. The Syrian government responded by unleashing a bombing and shelling campaign on the area, residents told CNN, including barrel bombs that flattened many of the buildings already scarred by the three-year-long conflict. Death comes day and night. "I looked up and saw dust," one resident said. "I opened the door and started walking outside and started shouting to the neighbors. One told me 'I am wounded,' another one didn't answer me at all. That second one -- may god have mercy on his soul -- he was martyred." While the battle for Yarmouk is very typical of Syria's civil war, the conflict here is unique. Most of those fighting on all sides are Palestinians. Pro-government factions besiege the area from the outside, cutting off supplies and aid most of the time. The inside is held by anti-regime groups, some of which are Islamists. The situation in Yarmouk was thrust in to the headlines on April 1 when ISIS fighters stormed the rebel-held area and unleashed a campaign of violence and killings. Since then, a local activist tells CNN, ISIS has withdrawn to another area and left the al Qaedalinked group Jabhat al-Nusra in charge of the district. 'The deepest circle of hell': Terrified Yarmouk residents describe ISIS raid. But this is only the most recent in a deadly urban war that is slowly grinding down Yarmouk's buildings and people. Of the more than 100,000 that used to live there, only about 18,000 remain, according to UNRWA, the U.N. agency tasked with aiding Palestinians. I have been to Yarmouk on various occasions, and the picture has always been the same. Pro-government factions surrounded the area and there was house-to house combat, mostly at night. A lot of destruction, very little territorial gain for either side, all of it taking a horrifying toll on the civilians trapped in the middle. "We have no food or water," one resident said, standing amid the ruins of Yarmouk's houses. "They should open a route so we can eat and drink and they can deliver assistance and food. We have nothing. What can we do?" But international aid groups can do very little. There are few occasions where aid is allowed into Yarmouk, or where civilians are allowed out. UNRWA can only care for those who do manage to escape. U.N. official to visit besieged refugee camp. The agency, along with the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, runs several shelters for displaced people in government-controlled areas near the camp. Pierre Krahenbuhl, the Commissioner General for UNRWA, recently visited some of them and acknowledged that far too little help was reaching those who need it most. "We have to call on the world and call on all the actors in the world who can influence the situation to mobilize," Krahenbuhl said. "But much more has to be done to respect the civilians and to make sure that they are safe inside the camp." But of course those still inside are by no means safe -- subjected to shelling, bombing and street combat on top of being thirsty, hungry and in need of medication. But one thing that has not been broken is the residents' self-respect and pride. "This is Yarmouk camp and we are not leaving our homes," one man said. "Whatever happens, if they keep hitting us with barrel bombs we will die." An elderly woman recalled her life as a Palestinian refugee. "I fled Palestine when I was seven years old," she said. "But I will not leave the Yarmouk camp even if I am 75 or 76 years old. Yarmouk camp is equal to my soul. I built it with my bare hands. I carried its stones on my head from a village and laid the foundation to my home. Block by block I carried them on my head." But despite their defiance, there's seemingly nothing that can be done to prevent Yarmouk from being reduced to rubble. This is a war of attrition, two sides fighting for inches in tough combat without seeing that they are wrecking the prize they claim to be fighting for. Desperation for Palestinians trapped in Syrian refugee camp.

Article: Queens Park Rangers manager Chris Ramsey has revealed he will have no problem shaking John Terry’s hand in light of the racist comments the former England captain directed at former Rs defender Anton Ferdinand four years ago. Terry, who will line up against Ramsey’s side, was banned for four games and fined £220,000 for the remarks made in October 2011 during Chelsea’s 1-0 defeat at Loftus Road. But Ramsey, the Premier League’s only black manager, thinks the issue has been dealt with. ‘Ultimately, John Terry is a player of Chelsea. I am a manager of QPR. As a man, as a person, I would shake his hand,’ Ramsey said. ‘I don’t know what his feelings are towards me. As long as there wasn’t anything on the field that was unprofessional by him, I would shake his hand. Queens Park Rangers manager Chris Ramsey speaks to the media on Friday ahead of the Chelsea match. Chelsea captain John Terry controls the ball during last weekend's Premier League match against Stoke. Ramsey arrives for Friday's pre-match press conference as QPR prepare to host Chelsea at Loftus Road. ‘The whole episode for British society sat uncomfortably. It’s not something we want to highlight in football. It happened and it’s being dealt with. We have to move on. And hopefully everyone has learned something from it.’ Ramsey revealed that Rio Ferdinand, who labelled Terry an idiot for the abuse aimed at his brother, won’t be fit in time for a reunion with the Chelsea skipper this weekend. But the 52-year-old suspects his player’s one-time England colleague will be on the receiving end of a hostile welcome from the home fans on his return the scene of the unsavoury incident. 'Rio has unfortunately got an injury, he’s had a knock, and it’s recurring, he keeps trying to train,' Ramsey continued. 'He will train this morning. He’s something we miss immensely. We miss his leadership qualities on the pitch. Unfortunately, he won't be involved in the game. ‘Fans are fans, aren’t they? (Terry’s return) is a subject that brings up a lot of different emotions. So it would be odd to think that there isn’t going to be an extra feeling towards that situation.’ QPR defender Anton Ferdinand avoids shaking hands with Terry before a league match in September 2012. Ferdinand and Terry argue during QPR's 1-0 victory against Chelsea at Loftus Road in October 2011. Rio Ferdinand, brother of Anton, will not be fit for Sunday's match against Chelsea.

Article: (Billboard)From Channing Tatum twerking for Jennifer Lopez to host Amy Schumer's archery fail, there were plenty of highlights and misfires from the 2015 MTV Movie Awards. 2015 MTV Movie Awards: See the full winners list. Here are the jokes, performances and moments that hit the target and the ones and missed it. Best Moments. Amy Schumer's opener: From a "Boyhood"/HPV joke to nearly flashing J.K. Simmons to her run-in with a cancer support group, Schumer's opening video segment was as reliably hilarious and inventive as her Comedy Central show (which can't come back on TV soon enough). Plus, her monologue killed: "Half of you know who I am, half of you think I'm Meghan Trainor." Channing Tatum doing his thing: When the cast of "Magic Mike XXL" presented J.Lo with the Scared As Shit Performance award, she asked them exactly what we were all thinking: "Why aren't you dancing?" Channing Tatum obliged, popping a twerk (in a suit) onstage in front of Lopez. "Your turn," he told her. Sadly, she did not oblige. Amy Schumer takes on Hillary Clinton, Zayn Malik and more in monologue. Rebel Wilson's censored moment: Introducing an exclusive clip from "Pitch Perfect 2" as an "exclusive clit" was easily the funniest non-Schumer joke of the entire night. Even her castmates seemed shocked when she slipped it in. Fall Out Boy meets Fetty Wap: "Centuries" didn't need a rap breakdown, nor did "Trap Queen" need a punk-rock edge. But did it sound killer on both counts? Hell yeah. Fetty with an electric guitar is something that needs to happen again. Charli XCX, Ty Dolla $ign & Tinashe: There's a reason Charli gets invited to every MTV awards show: She attacks a pop song with the abandon of a rock 'n' roll tidal wave. "Drop That Kitty" was Tinashe's time to shine, though. It's only a shame she got about 30 seconds to command the stage. Kiss Cam: Amy Schumer sensuously kissing Amber Rose just before a commercial break? Well played, Amy. Kevin Hart's Comedic Genius Award: While Kimmel's intro jokes were a little one-note (we get it, Kevin is short), it was pretty adorable that Hart brought his kids onstage to accept his Golden Popcorn. As his son held it, you realized the award was bigger than the kid's head. MTV Movie Awards: See all the photos. Robert Downey Jr. accepting Generation Award: His speech was fine (kudos for the "keep your nose clean" quip), but his Avengers castmates taking a knee while he accepted his award was just perfect. Misfires. Archery fail: Schumer's bow-and-arrow misfire was a literal misfire. It wasn't a big deal, but the fact that it ruined an entire gag (with Jimmy Kimmel pretending to get shot in the chest) was naturally awkward. Of course, Schumer poked fun at herself almost immediately. "Gone Girl" joke: "How good was Gone Girl? It's the story of what one crazed white woman -- or every Latina -- does when a man cheats on them," Schumer joked. It wasn't awful, just kinda off. MTV immediately cut to J.Lo laughing like "ummm, OK" -- which is an accurate response. Vin Diesel sings 'Furious 7' Paul Walker tribute song at MTV Movie Awards. Shailene Woodley speech: Woodley definitely marches to the beat of her own drum, which is part of her appeal. But halfway through her Trailblazer award acceptance speech, the neo-hippie charm wore off, leaving most people wondering what she was trying to say. One of those wondering where she was going was Woodley herself, who wrapped up her speech by admitting it had totally gotten away from her. Zac Efron and Dave Franco: Was the punchline for their whole shtick really just Efron grabbing Franco's balls? Yes. Apparently, a man touching another man's junk is still comedy gold in 2015. Dwayne Johnson: The Rock shouting into the camera about 2014's movie highlights was totally unnecessary. At this point, MTV has to realize we've heard jokes about "American Sniper", "Gone Girl", "Boyhood" and "Whiplash" for almost a year now, and we're all ready to move on. But God Bless The Rock for giving it his all.

Article: He has been a colossus of the game. He has made 700 professional club appearances and won 81 caps for England, six Premier League titles, the FA Cup and the Champions League. In his pomp, he was the stuff of strikers' nightmares, driving some of the world's greatest goalscorers to distraction with lightning-sharp reactions and an instinctive reading of the game. That's why it's such a shame that what is likely to be Rio Ferdinand's farewell year in the English game has fizzled out. Rio Ferdinand pictured in training at Queens Park Rangers last week. The 36-year-old defender started regularly in the first part of the season but has been unable to hold down his spot in the side. Ferdinand started the first seven matches of QPR's Premier League campaign before being dropped. Ferdinand has enjoyed a fantastic career, winning six Premier League titles, but a fairytale finish is unlikely. Ferdinand and Ryan Giggs lift the European Cup for Manchester United in Moscow back in 2008. Ferdinand also won 81 caps for England during his glittering career. He would love to be out there, hunting down and hassling opponents, robbing attackers of the ball, winning the aerial duels, playing his part in Queens Park Rangers' survival mission. Keeping them up would be a fitting curtain call. Instead, Ferdinand's season has been one spent on the margins - either suspended, benched or out of the squad altogether. Once again, the 36-year-old was forced to watch on from the sidelines as Rangers claimed a potentially crucial point away to Aston Villa on Tuesday night. Ferdinand had picked up a slight knock and was ruled out. He has played just five times since the start of October - not much of a swansong. On Sunday, he posted a Twitter picture of a pile of chicken bones after lunch at his mum's. He had not been involved in the 4-1 win at West Brom 24 hours earlier and it weirdly seemed to sum up his peripheral role at the moment. By contrast, Ferdinand had started QPR's first seven games of the campaign, lasting the full 90 minutes in all of them. Harry Redknapp had grand plans and the best of intentions last summer. Having called time on his Manchester United career after 12 trophy-laden seasons, Ferdinand moved to Loftus Road in what Redknapp described as a'remarkable coup for the club.' Harry Redknapp described Ferdinand's signing last summer as a'remarkable coup' for the club. But after initial promise, Ferdinand has largely spent the season on the bench. Premier League (6): 2002-03, 2006-07, 2007-08, 2008-09, 2010-11, 2012-13. FA Cup (1): 2003-04. Football League Cup (2): 2005-06, 2008-09. FA Community Shield (5): 2003, 2007, 2008, 2011, 2013. Champions League (1): 2007-08. FIFA Club World Cup (1): 2008. Even in his mid-thirties, Redknapp believed Ferdinand would bring 'quality, class, experience and know-how' as QPR returned to the top flight. He envisaged Ferdinand in a sweeper role, the central pivot of a three-man defence in an in-vogue 3-5-2 system. He would bring all that experience to bear, helping Clint Hill and Steven Caulker keep opposition attacks at bay. Unfortunately, it just didn't work. In their first seven Premier League games of the season, QPR won one, drew one and lost five. They leaked 15 goals and the scale of their task in staying in the top division was clear. Ferdinand was demoted to the bench, Richard Dunne and Nedum Onuoha were introduced and the dye was cast for the season. His suspension for using the word'sket' in a tweet didn't help and by the time that was served, Ferdinand was down the pecking order. Ferdinand has shown glimpses of his imperious best for QPR this season. But Ferdinand's farewell season in English football has not lived up to his expectations. Chris Ramsey has played Ferdinand on three occasions since taking over from Harry Redknapp. Queens Park Rangers find themselves two points from safety after their 3-3 draw at Aston Villa on Tuesday. As you would expect, Ferdinand has conducted himself like a model professional on the training ground, maintaining his fitness in case he was called upon. And there have been such occasions, notably the 2-0 win at Sunderland in February - Chris Ramsey's second game in charge after replacing Redknapp, that ended QPR's 11-game losing run on the road. Ferdinand may yet be called upon again in the run-in, with QPR sitting two points shy of safety, but the season so far will have fallen short of his hopes and expectations. That fairytale finale, with Ferdinand leading an heroic resistance to keep Rangers in the Premier League, seems unlikely. There are rumours that clubs in the money-soaked Qatar Stars League are preparing to tempt Ferdinand with one final payday but that remains to be seen. For now, Rio's farewell has sadly fallen a bit flat. The fixtures remaining for the bottom six in the Barclays Premier League.

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence.
Rio Ferdinand missed 3-3 thriller with Aston Villa through injury. He has featured in just five QPR matches since the start of October. Harry Redknapp initially wanted him to be at centre of a back three. But the plan backfired as Rangers made a poor start in Premier League. Ferdinand has found it difficult to regain his place in farewell year.

Article: (CNN)For superhero fans, the cup runneth over. Most of us know the members of the Avengers by now: Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk and the rest, and the fact that a few more like Quicksilver are joining the cast in the "Avengers: Age of Ultron" sequel. But there was one character who remained a mystery: the Vision, to be played by Paul Bettany. Thus far, we've only seen his eyes in a trailer. With less than a month to go before the movie hits theaters, Marvel Studios put all the speculation to rest with a poster featuring Bettany as the heroic android, who was a member of the superhero group for many years in the comics. Meanwhile, as many Marvel fans know, Thursday was the eve of the new Netflix series "Daredevil," and after a photoshopped first look at Charlie Cox's iconic red Daredevil suit went out, Marvel put out a video of the real one. Not to be outdone, director Bryan Singer announced a new character for next year's sequel "X-Men: Apocalypse," by telling Empire magazine that Ben Hardy would be playing the role of the winged mutant Angel. He even had a photo to share. And Thursday's new super images weren't quite done, because the questions over how Jamie Bell's rocky character The Thing in the rebooted "Fantastic Four" movie (out August 7) might look were also finally answered. And he looks... pretty much like The Thing we already knew (but reportedly, CGI this time). Within 24 hours, we got yet another indication that the superhero trend isn't going anywhere anytime soon (and we didn't even talk about the new photo of Ryan Reynolds' "Deadpool").

Article: Newcastle stand-in skipper Moussa Sissoko is facing disciplinary action after he was sent off following a reckless challenge on Liverpool midfielder Lucas Leiva during Monday's 2-0 defeat at Anfield. The France international was given a second yellow card for the offence, but head coach John Carver feels it should have been a straight red. 'The club will deal with that situation,' he said when asked if Sissoko - who is now banned for two matches - would be punished. Liverpool midfielder Lucas Leiva clutches his leg after Moussa Sissoko's tackle at Anfield. Sissoko hands the captain's armband to boss John Carver as he leaves the pitch after being sent off. 'He knows he was wrong. He was fortunate not to get a straight red and he agreed with me. 'He apologised afterwards to Lucas, which was important. 'But you think captains would lead by example. We have to improve our discipline. I will be looking at that.' Meanwhile, Carver says Newcastle cannot rely on the shortcomings of others to preserve their Premier League status. The Magpies are the division's most out-of-form side having lost five on the spin, scoring just one goal along the way. Liverpool's players surround Lucas following Sissoko's dangerous tackle during Monday night's game. Raheem Sterling bends the ball past Tim Krul to open the scoring in Liverpool's 2-0 win against Newcastle. They are nine points clear of danger with six matches to play, but Carver says it's about time they started helping themselves, starting with Sunday's visit of Spurs. 'These two home games (Spurs followed by Swansea) are massive for us. I'm not bothered about performances, we need results,' he said. 'I'm not worrying about that (relegation) at the moment, and the good thing is we have four games at home. 'But we need to start winning now. We can't rely on others teams. We can't afford to ease off, I have always said that. 'We have gone through a rough spell. It's down to me now to get players in right frame of mind.' Newcastle's players appear dejected as Joe Allen celebrates scoring Liverpool's second goal at Anfield.

Moussa Sissoko was sent off against Liverpool on Monday night. John Carver felt that Sissoko's second booking was worthy of a red card. Midfielder could be punished by his club on top of a two-game ban. Carver admits he is only concerned with results and not performances. Newcastle are 13th in the table, nine points off the relegation zone.

Article: (CNN)Ursula Ward kept repeating her son's name -- Odin. She steadied herself against the podium in the Fall River, Massachusetts, courtroom and occasionally paused. She was tired after more than two years of pain, punctuated Wednesday when her son's killer, Aaron Hernandez, was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. Odin Lloyd was her first born, her only son. "Odin was the backbone of the family. Odin was the man of the house. Odin was his sisters' keeper," Ward told Judge Susan Garsh, before Garsh sentenced the  former pro-football player. Lloyd was 27-years-old and working for a landscaping firm when he was killed in June 2013. He played football for the Boston Bandits, the oldest semi-pro team in Boston and the winner of four championships in the New England Football League, according to the team's website. His mother, sister, uncle and cousin described him as a champion of family, a gifted athlete and a hard worker with a sense of humor. They said he rode his bike several miles to get to work. He went to all of his niece's recitals. "Odin was my first best gift I (will) ever receive," his mother said. "I thank God (for) every second and every day of my son's life that I spent with him. "The day I laid my son Odin to rest," she continued, pausing to maintain her composure, "I think my heart stopped beating for a moment. I felt like I wanted to go into that hole with my son, Odin." She can still hear him talking to her: "'Ma, did you cook? Ma, go to bed. Ma, you're so beautiful.'" Ed Lloyd followed Ward to address the judge. Odin Lloyd's uncle thanked everyone who worked on the case against Hernandez. His nephew, he said, "meant a lot to me." "To see how he grew, the respect he had, the toughest thing for me is that I won't get to see him have a child...," Ed Lloyd said. He loved watching his nephew and his son together. "A lot of people won't see from the outside the value and the riches (Odin Lloyd) had," he said. "I'm sorry for where I stand today but I know that all the time I had with him was special and he'll always be with me." Who was Odin Lloyd? Odin Lloyd's sister Olivia Thibou wept as she explained what it has felt like to lose her brother. "These last couple years have been the hardest of our lives," she said, recalling that she was asked to writer her brother's eulogy.  "I got to write all the great memories I have of him." She laughed, recalling his insistence on wearing the same Adidas flip-flops until the soles wore away. He was "prideful," she said. He would take her car out and just when she was starting to angry, he'd pull in with the car shining and clean, inside and out. He taught her daughter how to ride a bike. His murder, she said, "feels like a bad dream." Ward told the court that she constantly thinks about her son. "I miss my baby boy Odin so much," she said. "But I know I'm going to see him again someday and that has given me the strength to go on." She has also apparently gained strength from the act of forgiveness. "I forgive the hands of the people that had a hand in my son's murder," she said. "I pray and hope that someday everyone out there will forgive them also." What's next for Aaron Hernandez?

Article: An exotic bird in Brazil was recorded making incredible sounds that wouldn’t be out of place on a video game. The Curl-crested Jay, which resides at the Criadouro Onca Pintada breeding centre, is native to South America and is known to be a good mimic of other birds and man-made sounds. With the ever-growing presence of human’s in their natural habitats, the bird is one example of a number of species that have learned to incorporate peculiar everyday sounds into their song. Videoed behind a fence, the bird initially makes a sinister noise like a distorted voice before creating an almost digital sound. Following this the bird makes a noise that sounds like running water before a Space Invaders style tune emerges from it. Discussing the video, companion parrot behavioural expert Greg Glendell spoke with MailOnline about the various theories regarding the function of these sounds. The Curl-crested Jay is native to South America and resides at the Criadouro Onca Pintada breeding centre. ‘Several groups of birds have a lifelong ability to learn to reproduce new sounds; notably parrots, starlings and crows,’ said Mr Glendell. The particular Jay belongs to the Crow/Corvidae family. ‘Some birds may use them to impress a mate or their peers within their flock,’ he added. ‘Most birds using mimicry are highly social species, with a complex vocal repertoire, which includes innate calls and learnt calls. The bird is one example of a number of species that have learned to incorporate peculiar everyday sounds into their song. ‘As social species they use their calls as language. There are often regional dialects within bird groups. So the same species shows differences in its calls across its range.’ Mr Glendell also noted that sometimes captive birds confined to cages use their ability to mimic to relieve their boredom and ensure responses from their owners. The original video was uploaded to YouTube account: Swiatoczamigoski by a Polish-based blogger who has spent some time volunteering at the Brazilian breeding centre. Videoed behind a fence, the bird initially makes a sinister noise like a distorted voice before creating an almost digital sound.

Article: (CNN)Former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez will need to keep his lawyers even after being convicted of murder and other charges in the death of Odin Lloyd. The 25-year-old potentially faces three more trials -- one criminal and two civil actions. Next up is another murder trial in which he is accused of killing two men and wounding another person near a Boston nightclub in July 2012. Prosecutors have said Hernandez fatally shot Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado when he fired into their 2003 BMW.  Another passenger was wounded and two others were uninjured. Hernandez pleaded not guilty at his arraignment. The trial was originally slated for May 28, but Jake Wark, spokesman for the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office, said Wednesday the trial had been postponed and no new date had been set. "We expect to select a new court date in the coming days and then set the amended trial track. The Suffolk indictments allege two counts of first-degree murder for the July 16, 2012, shooting deaths of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado in Boston's South End; three counts of armed assault with intent to murder and one count of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon for shots fired at three surviving victims; and one count of unlawful possession of a firearm," he said. The families of de Abreu and Furtado filed civil suits against Hernandez, and a judge froze his $5 million in assets, pending the outcome of the double-murder trial. The freeze includes the disputed $3.3 million signing bonus payment Hernandez claims he is owed by the New England Patriots. Hernandez is also being sued by a man who claims Hernandez shot him while they were in a limousine in Miami in February 2013. Alexander Bradley claims the then-New England Patriot tight end wounded him after the two got into a fight at a Miami strip club. In a lawsuit filed four months later, Bradley said Hernandez fired at him during a limo ride after leaving the club and that Hernandez intentionally "possessed a gun which he was not legally licensed to have." Hernandez's lawyers have argued he couldn't defend himself properly while on trial in Massachusetts. There was no criminal charge in the case. And then there is the grievance over unpaid bonus money filed by the NFL players union on behalf of Hernandez, who signed a contract in 2012 that potentially was worth more than $40 million. If the grievance is heard by the league, Hernandez will be represented by the the National Football League Players' Association. Who was Odin Lloyd? CNN's Lawrence Crook contributed to this report.

Article: Arsene Wenger has challenged his squad to put any dreams of a late charge for the Barclays Premier League to bed and focus instead on the cold reality of winning at Burnley on Saturday. Arsenal head to Turf Moor in search of what would be an eighth straight league victory, following on from last weekend's 4-1 triumph over Liverpool. Despite their superb run, which has seen confidence grow after some 15 wins in the last 17 through all competitions, the title remains Chelsea's to lose, as the leaders currently hold a seven-point advantage and also a match in hand. Nacho Monreal, Theo Walcott, Hector Bellerin and Olivier Giroud appear in good spirits during training. Mesut Ozil shares a joke with Monreal at Arsenal's training HQ while Alexis Sanchez has his shorts rolled up. Santi Cazorla is set to make his 100th Premier League appearance while Abou Diaby is back from injury. While some Gunners fans may have allowed themselves a little bit of fantasy football results over the run-in, which will see Chelsea come to the Emirates Stadium on April 26 and also play both Manchester United and Liverpool, Wenger remains very much focused on the job in hand. 'I have enough experience to know that I have to live with reality and reality is points and the next game,' he said. 'The dreams are for everybody - we all have dreams at night, but when I wake up in the morning I have to come here and make sure we give everything to win the next game.' Wenger continued: 'Chelsea have a difficult schedule, we have a difficult schedule, but what we can only do is master our own schedule. 'What we want is to go as high as we can until the end of the season, give our best and we are also in the semi-final of the FA Cup. 'So we are at an important moment of the Premier League season and it is a period where you show your quality by focusing on the next game and maintain the quality. 'Of course we want to continue to progress and improve - we can learn from victory as well and everything was not perfect in our last game.' Mathieu Flamini, Ozil and Sanchez are pictured at Arsenal's London Colney base on Friday. Laurent Koscielny is put through his paces on Friday as he bids to return to full fitness. Jack Wilshere hasn't played since November but is in line to feature at Burnley on Saturday evening. Arsenal's injury problems look to have finally eased, with midfielders Mikel Arteta, Jack Wilshere and Abou Diaby all having stepped up their rehabilitation from injury, along with full-back Mathieu Debuchy. England international Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, though, continues to be hampered by an inflamed groin, while centre-half Laurent Koscielny will face a fitness test on his thigh problem ahead of Saturday's match. Burnley continue to scrap at the other end of the table, currently second bottom, but only two points from safety. With Manchester City having gone down 1-0 at Turf Moor last month and Tottenham then held to a goalless draw, Wenger is not taking the trip to Lancashire lightly. He said: 'You shouldn't look at the table because they started slowly, but recently they have played very well against all the big teams in the league and are quite efficient at home. 'You have to be at their level of physical performance, because they will be there. 'On the rest, you want to produce the quality of performance that is expected from us on the technical side, but you have first to fight with them physically, that's for sure. 'We have to make sure we produce the expected performance on the commitment, on the focus and on the quality of our game.'

Article: (CNN)SPOILER ALERT! It's not just women getting cloned. That was the big twist at the end of "Orphan Black's" second season. The kickoff to the new season leads the list of six things to watch in the week ahead. 1. "Orphan Black," 9 p.m. ET, Saturday, April 18, BBC America. The cloning cult sci-fi series remains one of the most critically acclaimed shows on TV, thanks in large part to the performance of Tatiana Maslany, who has taken on at least six roles on the show so far, including a newly introduced transgender clone. Maslany told reporters this week that we can expect even more impressive scenes with multiple clones. "We like to push the boundaries of what we're able to do and the limits of those clone scenes," she said. "So, yes, you'll definitely see more complex clone work this season and that's just because we're getting more comfortable with the technology and we're excited by getting to sort of further complicate things." And the introduction of a group of male clones will certainly increase the suspense. "There definitely is a shift towards the Castor clones that we get to explore them a little bit more," she said. The fans of the show, dubbed the "Clone Club" have a lot to look forward to when the show premieres on Saturday the 18th, and Maslany is blown away by the response to the series so far. "We've always been really humbled and really inspired by our fans and by their dedication to the show and their knowledge of the show, and  just how it changes their own lives. It's incredible." 2. "Turn: Washington's Spies," 9 p.m. ET, Monday, AMC. The series about spies in the early days of the Revolutionary War returns with a new subtitle, "Washington's Spies," and a new Monday night time slot. Series star Jamie Bell told CNN what we can expect in the second season. "This year we have a lot more battles; we have the journey of [George] Washington and we're getting under his skin a little bit as well. We also introduce new characters like Benedict Arnold, a very infamous character in American history." Bell hopes the series might bring more recognition to the Culper spy ring and everything it did. "I think there should be a monument to all of the Culper ring somewhere. I was amazed that there is nothing [in Washington] about these people who did something extraordinary." 3. "Game of Thrones," 9 p.m. ET, Sunday, HBO. The world of Westeros returns for a fifth season in one of the biggest season premieres of the year. Click here for more on what to expect. 4. "Justified," 10 p.m. ET, Tuesday, FX. Timothy Olyphant's tour de force performance as Raylan Givens comes to an end Tuesday night, as the modern-day Western airs its season finale.

Article: Damning footage has revealed the moment a Florida police officer shouted: 'Get on the f****** ground or you're dead,' moments before he shot a mentally ill man as he was running away. The family of Lavall Hall, released the shocking video which calls into question the Miami Gardens police department's account of the incident on February 15. The clip captured from the police car at the scene shows shell cases flying as a police officer shot the 25-year-old schizophrenic, who was black, on February 15. The police department said the officers were forced to shoot because Hall 'attacked' them with 'deadly force' using the broom - but the video footage appears to show him trying to flee the officers before he was fatally shot. Footage captured from within a police car at the scene show shell cases flying as police officer Eddie Trimino fatally shot schizophrenic 25-year-old Lavall Hall, who was black, outside his home in Miami Gardens. Attorneys for Hall's family released the 19 minutes of dash-cam video yesterday afternoon at a press conference and claim it shows Hall was being chased by police before he was shot at five times. Hall, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, had been released from a mental hospital just one week earlier and was suffering from a psychotic episode when his mother, Catherine Daniels, called police to take him to a mental health unit, reports Fusion. Hall's family have now filed a wrongful death lawsuit  in federal court in Miami against the city of Miami Gardens and the two police officers, Peter Ehrlich and Eddo Trimino. According to the complaint Ms Daniels had previously called police for help with her son, and the department was aware of his condition, alleging excessive use of force by police and wrongful death. An officer can be heard shouting 'Get on the f****** ground or you're dead' on the police car footage. Hall, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, had been released from a mental hospital just one week before the shooting. The footage shot from inside the car appears to show Hall running past the car with two officers in pursuit. 'Hall was unable to communicate, clearly did not understand what was going on, and was visibly scared,' it said. Two of the five bullets fired hit Hall Miami Gardens police told reporters in the days after the incident - explaining that Hall had attacked officers with the broom. But Hall's lawyers argue that the police used 'excessive force' after he ran away from them. His lawyers said Hall was holding the broomstick and dressed only in his underpants but the video shows he can be seen running from the police. Ms Daniels said at a news conference yesterday: 'I never thought they [were] going to kill my child, murder my child,' adding she was 'devastated' when she first saw the video. Catherine Daniels, Lavall's mother, is hugged by her cousin Alfonzo Hill at the news conference yesterday. 'He was standing outside just holding the broomstick in his hand,' Daniels said. 'And I told him, 'Baby, come back inside, it's cold.' As the video played at the news conference, one of the attorneys for the family said Ms Daniels can be heard telling police before the shooting, 'Please don't hurt my child, please' ABC news reported. Her attorney added: 'The officers had made up their minds that they were going to kill Lavall before this incident took place.' 'They killed him, murdered him,' said Melissa Edwards, the mother of Hall's daughter, at the news conference. An attorney for Eddo Trimino, the officer involved, told the Miami Herald the video indicated that the officer had shot out of fear. The lawyer for the officers argues they acted appropriately and claims Hall attacked them with deadly force. The video was released amid national protests over a series of deaths resulting from police use of force, most recently with another video showing a white South Carolina police officer shooting an apparently unarmed black man in the back. 'People are saddened and angered but also exasperated that we're again seeing the devaluation of black lives on streets of the United States,' said Muhammed Malik, organizer of the Miami Committee on State Violence. A spokesman for Florida State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle told ABC News that the investigation is ongoing but they have concerns the video may endanger the investigation. Oscar Marrero, attorney for the officers, told ABC News: 'The officers were faced with a dangerous situation. 'They have already given statements to investigators indicating Mr. Hall struck them with a weapon and deadly force was used. 'The reasonableness of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene. The reliable evidence will establish Officers Trimino and Ehrlich acted appropriately.'

Lavall Hall, 25, was suffering psychotic episode when fatally shot by police. His mother had called police to help take mentally ill son to hospital. Police claim he attacked them with 'deadly force' using broom handle. But footage from scene  appears to show Hall running away from cops.

Article: (HLNtv)Actress Alyssa Milano had some angry tweets for Heathrow Airport authorities Thursday morning after workers there allegedly confiscated breast milk she'd pumped for her daughter while she was on a plane. Milano, who was on a trip with her husband that she described in an earlier tweet as a "romantic getaway," was furious. According to the Heathrow Airport guidelines on its website regarding baby food and/or milk, the airport asks that travelers carry only what they need for the flight. A blogger mom apparently experienced a similar issue at the airport in 2011 when her pumped milk was also confiscated. Per the UK Department of Transport, travelers can carry breast milk through security and are allowed quantities larger than 100ml if necessary. Milano, who has long been an outspoken advocate of breastfeeding, said the cooler the milk was in was also confiscated. See the original story at HLNtv.com.

Article: Kenny Miller fears Rangers' promotion bid could be derailed by the Ibrox side's rollercoaster run of form. Gers suffered the first defeat of new boss Stuart McCall's six-game reign on Thursday night as they slumped 3-0 at Queen of the South. It was an especially flat display after the high of recent Scottish Championship victories over Hearts and Hibernian. Kenny Miller fears Rangers' promotion bid could be derailed by the Ibrox side's rollercoaster run of form. The Light Blues - who remain behind the Easter Road side in third place on goal difference - now have five games left, starting with Raith on Sunday, to leapfrog Hibs and spare themselves the effort of playing two extra ties in the play-offs. Finish third and they could even be sent back to Palmerston - where they have now lost twice this season - for another testing clash with Queens, provided James Fowler's side see off Falkirk in the race for fourth. But the worry for striker Miller is that Gers' lack of consistency could wreck their chance of a Premiership return. The 35-year-old said: 'Last night was a reminder that we have not turned the corner and that there's a lot of hard work still to be done. Miller (centre) looks dejected as his Rangers side slumped to a 3-0 defeat at Queen of the South. 'It was a performance that summed up out season a little bit. That 'consistency' word has come up a lot this year. 'We seem to have a couple of good performances and then complacency kicks in and we take our foot of the gas. 'If we go back three games to the Hibs result, I don't think anyone could have seen that coming. Fast forward three games and I don't think anyone could have seen the result last night coming. 'We have to nail down that consistency and get to a level of performance that we can pretty much guarantee every week. Rangers had recently secured victories over Scottish Championship rivals Hearts and Hibernian. 'Might this inconsistency come back to haunt us in the play-offs? It could do, yes. 'There is no point winning 1-0 or 2-0 at home and losing 3-0 away - that means you are out. 'It's about getting that level and balance right.

Article: (CNN)Ten years ago, a prosecutor in Centre County, Pennsylvania, took a day off work and vanished. Since then, the case of Ray Gricar has become one of the most intriguing and talked about missing persons stories in the country. Investigators have taken dives to the bottom of lakes, dug up a grave, chased more than 300 reported sightings from Arizona to North Carolina, dropped fliers over Slovenia, consulted a psychic, interviewed a member of the Hell's Angels and enlisted NASA technology. But no one has been able to find the veteran district attorney, who was 59 when he disappeared. When he went missing that Friday morning on April 15, 2005, he left behind a live-in girlfriend, a beautiful and successful daughter and a bank account that was supposed to fund a fast-approaching retirement. His red Mini Cooper was found abandoned near a bridge on the Susquehanna River about 55 miles away from his home. Months later his county-issued laptop and hard drive were found -- separately -- on the banks of the river, too damaged to read. As far as hard evidence goes, that's about all police have. The best lead they got was the sighting of a woman who has not been identified, and information that he had searched online for ways to destroy a hard drive. What's left is theory, speculation and a case that's been cold almost from the beginning. "When a district attorney goes missing, you know, it's pretty big. It's going to catch people's attention. A lot of people don't have a large footprint. This guy had influential friends, he was well known," said Todd Matthews, director of communications and case management for the National Missing and Unidentified Person System, or NamUs. From the start, investigators have considered three possibilities: Gricar committed suicide, fell victim to foul play or deliberately walked away. The prevailing theories have been suicide or walk-away, especially since 2009, when a search of his Google history on his home computer found that someone had been searching "how to fry a hard drive" and "water damage to a notebook computer." Gricar, a private and quiet man, was spotted with a woman who was not his girlfriend the day he went missing, and cigarette ash was found near his car, even though he was not a smoker. Friends and colleagues recalled him being distant in the weeks that led up to his disappearance, and recounted his fascination with another law enforcement official from Ohio who vanished in 1985. Matthews said that NamUs has compared Gricar's DNA to unidentified bodies nine times since the database became available in 2009, but so far, none has been a match. "Even if he chose to make himself go missing, it sounds like something was terribly wrong that caused a drastic change in his life. There's something wrong if he's Googled how to fry a hard drive. Did he Google it? Did someone else Google it? Was he threatened? Did he do something and is trying to cover it up? It's not a normal thing to Google that." Matt Rickard, the former investigator who had been in charge of the investigation for several years, thinks that hard drive is the key to cracking the case. He said he's still holding out hope that someday technology will allow investigators to recover the damaged data. "I think there is something out there. Whether it's evidence or a person, there's something that could lead us to something," he said. "In all honesty, somebody destroyed the hard drive and there was a reason. We have very few solid leads and the biggest one could be contained on that hard drive." In 2011, when former Penn State defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky was arrested and charged with sexually abusing boys, it was revealed that it was Gricar who decided not to charge Sandusky when the first victim came forward in 1998. Gricar cited a lack of evidence. The intrigue already simmering in Gricar's case exploded. Sleuths desperately tried to find a link between the two cases, but investigators said there was no evidence that Gricar's disappearance had anything to do with Sandusky's crimes. But some have stuck to the homicide theory, suggesting that Gricar was an enemy of mob-like gangs in central Pennsylvania who were upset at his drug and corruption prosecutions. Cyril Wecht, a forensic pathologist, said he considered writing a book about Gricar, his ties to the Sandusky case, and whether it led to suicide. But, Wecht said, he abandoned the book idea when it became clear there was not enough evidence. "I don't think it's a great stretch," Wecht said. "He was one of those guys with a very strong sense of justice and professional discipline and in light of what evolved and came to be disclosed -- I speak as a forensic pathologist who's done so many suicides over the years and what can bring someone to that point. It's pure conjecture, not based on any factual knowledge." Plus, Wecht said, if it was a suicide, "I don't understand how they never recovered the body." Bob Buehner, a former district attorney in Montour County, Pennsylvania, who was Gricar's friend, has never accepted a suicide or walk-away theory. He believes his colleague was killed. Buehner has doubts that, 10 years later, state police can recover from what he considers a bungled start to the case. "It didn't seem like there was any overall game plan that made sense in terms of a systematic investigation," Buehner said. "One of the things I'd asked them to do from the first couple weeks is now impossible to do -- to do a hotel-motel canvas looking for the mystery woman seen with Ray and then match the names with photo IDs which police have access to." Buehner said those records are now gone and his faith in finding Gricar is dwindling. "I give it a 50-50 at best and only because I'm an optimist and I hope that's what will happen," he said. "As a pessimist, maybe 1 in 10 that we'll find him." Despite fresh eyes on the investigation when it was handed over to state authorities last year, the mystery woman has not been found. "Pennsylvania State Police continue to chase down new leads and take a fresh look at old leads and we continue to hold out hope that something will break out in this case," said Centre County's District Attorney Stacy Parks Miller. "Everybody, regardless of what position they held, deserves this kind of attention. In any missing persons case, he's not the only one, we feel discouraged when we can't answer the questions for the family, but it doesn't change our dedication to the case." The case has gotten significant attention on the national level, appearing on several true-crime television shows, including HLN's "Nancy Grace." So it was strange to many in Pennsylvania that for years a case with such a high profile would be handled by the tiny Bellefonte Police Department, where one investigator was assigned to juggle Gricar's case along with several more. In 2014, the state police took over, but that was nine years after Gricar went missing and two years after he had been declared legally dead. Sources close to the investigation told CNN the case, as state police received it, was disorganized and porous. Evidence had been compromised in storage. Reports were missing. Evidence had been collecting dust in file cabinets. There was never a forensic audit of his finances. Today, some of Gricar's friends believe the case is damaged beyond repair. They have lost faith that there will ever be any answers. When asked if she thought things might change when state police got the case, Barbara Gray, his ex-wife and the mother of his daughter Lara, said no. "The evidence is the same," she said. Lara declined to comment, and investigators said they've had trouble reaching her. "There is always a remote possibility that we might never have an answer," said Lt. James Emigh, who leads the investigation for the Pennsylvania State Police after inheriting it last year. "We still hold out hope, and the state police will however continue to diligently follow up every possible lead and attempt to bring closure to the family and friends of Ray."

Article: Palmerston remains a very painful place for Rangers managers. Consider this the first harsh lesson of Stuart McCall’s tenure. Back in the chill of mid-December, Ally McCoist led the Ibrox side here on the day it emerged he had handed in his notice of resignation. A convincing 2-0 defeat did nothing to alleviate the mood of gloomy chaos that had engulfed the club. Nine days later, McCoist was out on gardening leave. Fast forward almost five months, and Rangers arrived here in far more ebullient spirits with a new boardroom regime installed and three successive victories under McCall’s command. That Hibs and Hearts were among the victims added to the sense of a substantial revival. In Dumfries, however, it felt more like a flashback to the bad old days of their campaign. Rangers were simply second-best all over the plastic pitch in Dumfries. Striker Derek Lyle points to the skies after putting Queen of the South in the lead at Palmerston Park. Lewis Kidd celebrates after an own goal doubles Queen of the South's lead at the start of the second half. Gavin Reilly (left) celebrates after forcing an own goal for  QOTS's third to dent Rangers' second place hopes. Queen of the South: Clark, Durnan (Hooper), Dowie, Higgins, Kidd, McShane, Carmichael, McKenna, Holt, Lyle (Pickard), Reilly (Russell) Subs: Paton, Atkinson, Smith, Smith. Booked: Higgins. Scorers: Lyle 33', Wallace (og) 46', Reilly 69' Rangers: Robinson, McGregor, Zaliukas, Mohsni, Wallace, Templeton (Crawford), Law, Murdoch, Vuckic, Miller (Hardie), Clark (Boyd) Subs: Black, Shiels, Simonsen, Sinnamon. Booked: Templeton, Moshni. Ref: Don Robertson. Att: 5,093. Immense credit must go to Queens, who recorded a thoroughly merited victory that has significantly boosted their play-off hopes. Under James Fowler, they are capable of bright, energetic football that delivered goals from Derek Lyle and Gavin Reilly, as well an own goal from Lee Wallace. McCall, though, must have felt a twinge of despair. He has spent much of his recent time emphasising that nothing had been achieved by the recent uplift. That so much work still had to be done were they to achieve their aim of promotion. A first defeat of his six-game reign confirmed that assessment in the most emphatic fashion. The Ibrox outfit remain third behind Hibs on goal difference, albeit with a game still in hand. Radical improvement is once again required when they host Raith Rovers on Sunday. Queens will face Falkirk at that same time, having just overhauled their key rivals for the fourth and final play-off spot. This was the best possible fillip for Fowler’s men, as they seek to grow that one-point advantage. Ranger's Newcastle loanee Haris Vukic (left) attempts to block a shot by QOTS' Chris Higgins. New manager Stuart McCall (right) suffered his first defeat since taking charge of the Ibrox club. Rangers were without suspended skipper Lee McCulloch – banned after a red card for an elbow on Hearts’ Osman Sow at the weekend – which meant a starting role for Bilel Mohsni alongside Marius Zaliukas at the heart of the defence. There was little to trouble either backline in the initial exchanges, as the game developed at a rather sedate pace. McCall watched it unfold pensively. Clearly, what he was seeing wasn’t to his liking. His side did have flickers of threat early on, but they often owed much to fortune. Andy Murdoch saw a mis-hit cross clawed out by Zander Clark, before a similar delivery from David Templeton looped fractionally over. The winger was another change to McCall’s line-up and he saw plenty of the ball before the break, without making it amount to a great deal. QOTS's Kidd (left) Rangers fends off David Templeton of Rangers as he runs with the ball. Lyle (2nd left) opened the scoring following a first-half corner in the 3-0 defeat of Rangers. Lyle (centre) wheels away after putting the hosts in front with a strike on 33minutes. One neat bit of skill saw him drift infield from the left flank before thumping a shot just too high. Another powerful swipe was blocked by Andy Dowie’s head – at the expense of ringing ears. Queens had offered even less up front throughout this spell, but suddenly sprang into life to claim the lead after 33 minutes with pretty much their first serious attack. Daniel Carmichael swept play wide to Lewis Kidd who took on Wallace. The Ibrox left-back toppled, apparently looking for a foul that wasn’t there, allowing Kidd to break into the penalty area. His cut-back found Lyle, who took a touch on his left foot before dispatching a sweet finish off his right. The home fans roared approval, barely having time to draw breath before the advantage was very nearly doubled. Lyle set up Reilly and his daisy-cutter drew a fine stop from Lee Robinson at full stretch. The QOTS striker acknowledges the home supporters after making the score 1-0 in the first half. Play continues as a flare is let off in the Rangers section of the crowd at Palmerston Park. QOTS goalkeeper Zander Clark ensures Rangers' Bilel Mohsni does not find the back of the net. Rangers used the shock to stir them into greater vigour. Nicky Clark was close with a brave effort from a Darren McGregor cross, which led to him being flattened by his namesake in the Queens goal. Then, after a Haris Vuckic corner caused uncertainty, Kenny Miller sent a looping header against the bar. The first half duly closed with a penalty shout from Wallace after he tangled with Mark Durnan. Referee Don Robertson remained unmoved. Far worse followed for Wallace 16 seconds after the restart as he got the final touch to his side’s second concession of the evening. Kidd celebrates after forcing an own goal from Rangers Lee Wallace immediately after the break. QOTS's Gavin Reilly (left) demonstrates a calm finish to put his side 3-0 to the good. Ibrox minds still appeared to be in the dressing room as Reilly surged into the box and sent a low cross speeding through the six yard box. It reached Kidd beyond the far post, who angled a drive back towards goal. Off balance, Wallace attempted to clear from the line but only succeeded in helping the ball into the net via his heel. Rangers were rocking. They looked shaken by the energy of their hosts. Fowler’s side seemed to be first to the ball in every area. Templeton collected a booking for diving after attempting to go past Durnan, but creating clear chances remained a trickier task. Not long after, the winger was replaced by Robbie Crawford. Clark saw a deflected effort held, before a Mohnsi effort from distance was shuttled round the post. Yet there still wasn’t a convincing edge to these attacking forays. The fluidity witnessed against Hearts at the weekend had disappeared. Scott Hooper applauds the home support as he leaves the field followed by dejected Rangers players. Queens were now content to try and pick Rangers off when they could. And they notched their clinching third goal after 69 minutes. Holt nicked possession away from Crawford and worked a little exchange that released Reilly. The flag stayed down as he calmly slotted beyond Robinson. Rangers attempted a pride-saving late flurry but found Clark in excellent form in the home goal. Notable saves from Vuckic and substitute Kris Boyd ensured McCall’s side would exit without even a sliver of consolation.

Article: (CNN)As Americans mark the 150th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's death this week, let us remember that he not only belongs to the ages, but also belongs, in a special way, to Illinois. Lincoln's two greatest legacies -- indivisible union and irreversible emancipation -- grew organically from his Midwestern roots. He knew firsthand that no defensible border shielded the land of corn from the land of cotton. The entire region from the Appalachians to the Rockies drained through the Mississippi River, enabling farmers in this vast basin to float their goods down to market through New Orleans and from there to the world. He thus could never allow a potentially hostile power to control this geostrategic chokepoint in particular, or Dixie more generally. The U.S. landmass, he insisted, "is  well adapted to be the home of one national family; and it is not well adapted for two, or more" because "there is no line, straight or crooked, suitable for a national boundary upon which to divide." Lincoln supplemented his Midwestern geography lesson with a distinctly Midwestern claim about constitutional history: "The Union is older than any of the States; and in fact, it created them as States." Lincoln did not need to make this controversial claim to prove his case, and elsewhere he stressed the decisive legal point that the Constitution's text clearly prohibits unilateral secession. The Constitution is always and everywhere the supreme law of the land -- no matter what an individual state says. But Lincoln's additional assertion that the Union created the states, not vice versa, provoked strong disagreement in other parts of the country. Most Virginians, including Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, insisted that of course Virginia had come first!  At the outbreak of the American Revolution, the Old Dominion was already a century and a half old. Generations of Lees had helped govern Virginia long before the United States was born. But if Lee was, first and always, a Virginian, Lincoln was an American. His father came from Virginia, his grandfather hailed from Pennsylvania, and before that, the family had probably lived in New England. Abe himself had been born in Kentucky and had moved as a boy to Indiana, and later, as a young man, to Illinois. These latter two Midwestern states had undeniably been formed by the Union itself. These places had begun as federal territory -- the common inheritance of all Americans -- and it was the federal government that had indeed brought these new states to life. When young Abe moved to Indiana, it was just becoming a state, thanks to federal governmental action. It was a wise set of federal policies -- proper land surveys and a commitment to public education -- that had drawn the Lincolns and countless other Kentuckians to leave the Bluegrass State for a brighter future in the Midwest. Retracing Lincoln's assassination 150 years later. That brighter future also involved freedom from slavery. The Old Northwest had always been free soil, as provided for by a Northwest Ordinance that predated the U.S. Constitution.  The words of the 13th  Amendment -- the only constitutional amendment that Lincoln would live to sign -- promised to end slavery everywhere in America and did so by borrowing verbatim from Article 6 of the Northwest Ordinance. True, geography is not inexorable destiny. Many other Midwesterners in Lincoln's era embraced slavery and secession. Hugo Black, the Supreme Court justice who did the most to make Lincoln's constitutional vision a reality over the next century, was born and raised in Alabama. But geographic variation has always been a large part of America's constitutional saga. In the 1860 election that brought him to power, Lincoln swept almost all the Northern states, but did miserably in the slaveholding south. John Wilkes Booth, the dastard who ended Lincoln's life 150 years ago this week, was an embittered extremist from a slave state. So was Lincoln's nemesis on the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Roger Taney. Taney's most infamous ruling, the pro-slavery Dred Scott decision in 1857, had emerged from a court dominated by the South; although slave states accounted for less a third of America's free population, this region held an absolute majority of the seats on the court. Remembering Lincoln's murder. In our era, given the fact that Republican appointees have held a majority of the court for the last 40 years, the court has been rather moderate. Much of this moderation has come courtesy of northern Republicans on the Court -- most notably, Minnesota's Harry Blackmun, Illinois' John Paul Stevens, and New Hampshire's David Souter. All nine of the current justices learned their law in liberal New England, at Harvard or Yale, and the Republican appointee most attentive to gay rights, Anthony Kennedy, grew up in northern California, a corner of the country renowned for its respect for alternative lifestyles. Which takes us back to Lincoln. When Anthony Kennedy was a lad in California's state capital, the governor, a friend of the Kennedy family, was a Lincoln Republican named Earl Warren -- a man who would later author the Court's iconic opinion in Brown v. Board of Education, vindicating the constitutional amendments enshrined by Lincoln and his allies. Today, both parties at their best claim Lincoln. Jeb Bush aims to appeal to the better angels of our nature and Rand Paul is a Kentuckian who professes interest in racial outreach. Hillary Clinton was born an Illinois Republican. And the leader of her adopted political party -- who also happens to be president -- is a lanky and brainy lawyer from Illinois who knows how to give a good speech, and who swept to power in 2008 by recreating Lincoln's geographic coalition, winning every state within a four-hour drive of Chicago. In the largest sense, then, all Americans, of both parties and all regions -- whether or not they have ever set foot in Illinois -- are living in the Land of Lincoln.

The 19-year-old Spaniard is Real Madrid's first choice to fill the left side of their defence next season. But AS reports that both Chelsea and City are keen to snap Gaya up, with the Manchester club the most interested as they consider him to be a suitable replacement for Aleksandar Kolarov. Jose Luis Gaya celebrates after scoring for Valencia against Espanyol in the Copa del Rey in January. Gaya (right) charges forward past Atletico Madrid midfielder Gabi during a league match last month. Manchester City defender Aleksandar Kolarov (right) challenges Lionel Messi at the Nou Camp last month. The Serbian defender is keen to return to Italy after starting just 11 Premier League games for City this season. Gaya is a key player for Valencia, having played 27 league matches this season, and the third-placed La Liga club are putting together a second offer to renew his deal after the first was rejected. Gaya is a Spain Under 21 international, though he was forced to leave the camp last week after suffering a hamstring injury. He is hopeful of being fit for Valencia's crucial league clash with Villareal at the Mestalla on Sunday.

Article: (CNN)Justice may be blind, but it's easy to see that Marvel's "Daredevil" is already a hit with fans. The pitch-black-dark new series streamed its entire first season on Netflix on Friday morning, and the early word is quite good. Charlie Cox is perfectly cast as blind attorney Matt Murdock, whose nights are consumed with cleaning up the New York neighborhood of Hell's Kitchen while dressed in a black ninjaesque outfit. As the season unfolds, he heads toward a confrontation with Vincent D'Onofrio's Wilson Fisk, a.k.a. the Kingpin. Two love interests enter Murdock's life in the form of Karen Page (Deborah Ann Woll) and Claire Temple (Rosario Dawson). Oh, and there's that red suit. So what do critics think? Quite a lot, with 94% giving it positive reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. "Marvel's 'Daredevil,' Netflix's latest offering, is a well-scripted, beautifully acted superhero saga that is surprisingly impressive," said the Philadelphia Inquirer's Tirdad Derakhshani. "The series stays incredibly faithful to Daredevil's pulp roots and does something delightfully unexpected -- trust its fans enough to spare us a long, drawn-out origin story," said Sadie Gennis of TV Guide. Early risers on Twitter praised the show as well, especially Cox's performance, as well as a drawn-out, well-choreographed fight scene in episode 2. Does Netflix have a "House of Cards"-like hit on its hands? Time will tell.

Article: The 2013/14 season was seen as a step forward for Arsenal, spending the majority of the campaign at the top of the Premier League and ending their trophy drought with the FA Cup. But the Gunners still finished in fourth place yet again, with Arsene Wenger's team were heavily criticised after throwing away the title. That poor run of form in 2014 couldn't seem further away now with Arsenal flying in the league, a recent 4-1 victory against Liverpool demonstrating their step forward. But still, the north London side have exactly the same record as they did at this stage last season. Arsenal were reeling after a 6-0 defeat by Chelsea at this stage last season and had 63 points from 31 games. The Gunners are now in fine form and beat Liverpool 4-1 on Saturday but still have the exact same record. The Premier League table after Arsenal had played 31 games in 2013/14 (left), and now (right) Played 31, won 19, drawn six, lost six - the only stat differentiating the two tables is Arsenal's favourable goal difference in this campaign - a season which their points tally of 63 merits a place of second, rather than fourth. With the addition of Alexis Sanchez as well as a new-found solidity in Francis Coquelin and the goalscoring returns of Olivier Giroud and Mesut Ozil, the Gunners are already being tipped to challenge for the title next season. But the run of form at the start of the season - in contrast to 2013/14 when they impressed in the opening months - has cost Wenger. Defeats by Swansea, Stoke and Manchester United will be looked back on with regret by this Arsenal team, as well as dropping points late on at Liverpool and Tottenham. Mathieu Flamini celebrates after equalising in Arsenal's 31st game last season against Manchester City. The Gunners were in fine form at the beginning of the 2013/14 season and topped the table for many weeks. They currently top the European form guide but still can't beat their efforts from last year, at this stage at least. Wind back a year and Arsenal were reeling from a 6-0 defeat by Chelsea, drawing with Swansea and Manchester City before another humiliating loss at the hands of Everton. Things are certainly on the up for the Gunners now and they do look in fine shape heading into the summer, but they should not forget what could have been, this season and last. Arsene Wenger will regret many results in this season - including a 3-2 defeat by Stoke City in December.

Arsenal were title contenders in 2013/14 season before faltering at the end. Gunners have same record after 31 games: Won 19, drawn six, lost six.

Article: Polk City, Florida  (CNN)If you drove by it, you wouldn't even know it's there. The Ringling Bros. Center for Elephant Conservation sits on 200 acres of land in rural central Florida, halfway between Orlando and Sarasota, off a nondescript country road. An armed security guard greets you at the entrance. After a short drive down a gravel road, you get the sense this is a special place. "You can walk around and you don't hear anything," said Kenneth Feld, who opened the center in 1995. "These elephants, they have these large feet and they travel silently through the fields. I think it's very peaceful." Twenty-nine elephants currently live here, and 13 more will join the group by 2018, after Ringling Bros. decided this year to stop using elephants in its traveling circus. "This was a decision that our family had discussed for quite some time," said Feld, chairman and CEO of Feld Entertainment, the company that owns Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey. The change comes after years of repeated criticism and lawsuits by animal rights groups. The ultimate decision to phase out the elephants, Feld said, is the result of the different laws regulating the use of the animals in each of the 115 cities the circus visits every year. "You can't operate any business, much less with animals, if you don't have consistency from city to city," Feld said. "It's a definite expense to be in litigation and to be fighting legislation, and there is a saying and it's been around for a long time: 'You can't fight city hall.' And we found that to be the case in this situation." The circus business has been a part of the Feld family since 1967, when Irvin Feld purchased Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey. When Irvin died in 1984, his son, Kenneth, took over. "This is a whole family affair," he said. "It's a family affair for our family but also for all the elephants." When the center opened 20 years ago, it housed fewer than 10 elephants. "It was a place for elephants to retire," Feld said. Today, the center houses elephants of all ages. "We have lots of different elephants, meaning males and females, youth elephants, older elephants, so it is a great place to study behavior," he said. The center is also focused on breeding the animals. Wendy Kiso, a research and conservation scientist, spends her days at an onsite lab, trying to figure out how to keep the species from going extinct. Part of her lab includes several tanks that "cryo-preserve" elephant sperm at negative-196 degrees. "We process the semen and we extend it in such a way that we can freeze it," Kiso said. "This is a genetic resource bank for Asian elephants." Twenty-six elephants have been born here, Feld said. Mike, the newest pachyderm to join the group, was born at the center's birthing barn nearly two years ago. "We have the largest and only sustainable herd of Asian elephants in the Western Hemisphere," Feld said. Caring for the elephants is no small task. Trudy Williams and her husband, Jim, spend their time taking care of the animals' daily needs. It takes the couple hours to bathe, walk and feed the elephants every day. "First thing in the morning, we water them, and give them some treats and feed them some hay," Williams said. Each elephant eats about 150 pounds of food a day. Twenty-one tons of hay usually lasts only 10 days at the center. Exercise is also part of the daily routine, including stretching. "We just do that a few times on each leg with them, just to give them a good stretch," Williams said."We do some footwork with them. All of our elephants, generally once a month, get a pedicure, just to make sure their feet are in good condition." All of this care isn't cheap. "Each elephant costs over $65,000 a year, per year, over all the years of their life," Feld said. "We're fortunate we're for profit. We do make a profit and we're a privately owned family business, and so we've made a decision we want to devote a lot of resources here." It's a price Feld said he's willing to pay to keep this species -- some varieties of which in Asia and Africa are endangered -- alive for generations to come. "I always say, it's sort of like Jurassic Park with a happy ending," Feld said. "We knew that if we didn't do something, maybe my grandchildren would never have the opportunity to see these incredible animals." CNN's Javier de Diego contributed to this report.

The disease is caused by damage to the brain that coroners ruled the West Brom icon sustained through heading heavy leather footballs during his career in the 1960s and 1970s. The Leicester fixture was chosen by Astle's widow Laraine and daughters Dawn and Claire because he made his West Brom debut against The Foxes 50 years ago. West Brom supporters regularly applaud in the ninth minute of games at The Hawthorns, marking the number Astle wore on his shirt.

Article: (CNN)Two years ago, the storied Boston Marathon ended in terror and altered the lives of runners, spectators and those who tried to come to their rescue. Just last week, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was convicted on 30 charges related to the bombings at the race and the dramatic violence that dragged out for days afterward. The jury will begin deliberating his punishment next week. The death penalty is on the table. Dzhokhar and his brother Tamerlan, who was killed in a shootout with police, were intent on terrorizing not just Bostonians, but all Americans, prosecutors said. But the Tsarnaevs were not on the minds of most people in Boston on Wednesday. The injured victims and those who lost their lives were spoken of with reverence in somber ceremonies. Relatives of 8-year-old Martin Richard, the attack's youngest victim, and the family of Krystle Campbell  stood with Gov. Charlie Baker and Mayor Martin Walsh. Bagpipes played and banners whipped in the wind on Boylston Street, the Boston Globe reported. Boston University graduate student Lingzi Lu also was killed in one of the two horrific blasts that brought chaos to the competitors and spectators near the race's finish line on April 15, 2013. Who were the victims? Many bombing survivors were in the crowd for Wednesday's events, the newspaper said. They wore white, blue and yellow pins celebrating "One Boston Day," which was created to recognize acts of valor and to encourage kindness among Bostonians. Many there and those who couldn't observe the day in person tweeted their respect and memories using #BostonDay. The marathon historically happens on a Monday. This year, runners will take on the 26.2 mile challenge April 20. "I think today will always be a little emotional for me -- Marathon Monday is my favorite day of the year, and will continue to be, despite these tragedies," Boston resident Lindsey Berkowitz told CNN. "I have so much respect and support for all of the survivors, and hope the city continues to come together on this day to embrace the strength and resilience of Boston, and the love we all have for this great city." Melanie DiVasta was working just a mile from the finish line in 2013 when one of the bombs set by the Tsarnaevs exploded. Several of her friends were waiting at the finish line. They were unharmed. "It was just an overwhelming feeling of shock to start hearing about it and seeing images," DiVasta said. "You couldn't help but cry and just ask why." What's next for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev? CNN's Jareen Imam contributed to this report.

Article: A newly-released video has highlighted the shocking - and arguably discriminatory - price differences between near-identical products and everyday services offered to women and men,. The clip, which was created by HLN's The Daily Share, illustrates the prevalence of this 'women's tax' to shocking affect by directly comparinga variety of different products and services aimed at men and women and then revealing the price differences. Even more disappointing is that this practice of 'invisible tax' is not only found almost everywhere, but it is entirely legal in almost every state in the US - even when the products or services are exactly the same for both genders. Scroll down for video. That price could use a shave: The Daily Share found that the differences between these razors of the same brand differed by more than a dollar between the men's and women's versions. Compounded with the fact that women make, on average, 78 cents on the dollar to men, the facts prove than gender bias is more than just offensive, it's also very expensive. For example, a Schick’s Hydro 5 men’s razor was picked up for $8.56, but the women's version - the Schick Hydro Silk - was, for some reason, given more than a one dollar mark-up, and was priced at $9.97. An even greater disparity was found in the perfume aisle, where Narciso Rodriguez Eau de Toilettes For Him and For Her respectively cost $87 and $106.60. Meanwhile, a pair of Neutrogena anti-aging creams with the exact same ingredients were also found to inexplicably cost women $1.07 more per ounce - despite the skincare brand admitting that the two products were essentially the exact same product encased in different packaging. One of the few equal prices found by the video's creators was, of course, on a unisex American Apparel shirt. But when a man and a woman each dropped off the exact same shirt to get dry-cleaned, the woman was charged an extra 75 cents - and the tag even labelled the laundered item as a 'Lady Shirt'. Something smells fishy: There is almost a ful 20 dollar difference between the his and hers versions of this brand of cologne. Seriously? The presenters claim that the exact same shirt dropped off at a dry cleaners cost more to clean when a woman brought it in. The two presenters do point out that conditions are getting slightly better; medical insurance used to cost women in America $1 billion more each year before ObamaCare outlawed the practice of gender-biased pricing discrimination. However, in terms of everyday gender-taxing across the country, a 1995 report found that 'gender tax' cost women approximately $1,351 annually - a number which doesn't show any signs of decreasing any time soon. And while the shocking statistics in the caused California to put a state-wide ban on the practice in 1996, with New York City also opting to impose a similar ban on gender pricing, the rest of the US continues to allow the practice. Even something as basic as long-term care insurance costs women 13 per cent more, a hike they apparently base on the fact that women have longer life-spans - in the same way that they raise rates on smokers. 'But people choose to smoke,' says the female presenter. 'I didn't choose to be a woman.'

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence.
The clip, which was created by The Daily Share, compares near-identical products for men and women and highlights the price differences. According to the creators of the video, California is one of the few states to have put a ban on 'gender pricing discrimination'

Article: Nairobi, Kenya (CNN)University of Nairobi students were terrified Sunday morning when they heard explosions -- caused by a faulty electrical cable -- and believed it was a terror attack, the school said. Students on the Kikuyu campus stampeded down the halls of the Kimberly dormitory, and some jumped from its fifth floor, the university said. Hundreds were injured and were taken to hospitals. One person died, according to the school. The confusion and panic came less than two weeks after Al-Shabaab slaughtered 147 people at a college in Garissa, Kenya. Kenyan teachers and students have said they fear being targeted by the Somalia-based terrorists. On Sunday, as many as 108 students from the University of Nairobi were admitted to Kenyatta National Hospital. Among them, at least 63 students have been discharged, and at least four are slated for surgery, the school said. Almost all of the 54 students being treated at PCEA Kikuyu Hospital have been released, the university said. Kenya Power authorities and its CEO are at the school and looking into the electrical issue. Normal power supply will resume after repairs, the university said. "As we mourn the unfortunate loss of the departed student, we are also praying for the quick recovery of those who were injured," said Vice Chancellor Peter M.F. Mbithi in a statement. He called on the students, staff and public to remain calm. CNN's Lillian Leposo reported from Nairobi and Ashley Fantz wrote this story in Atlanta.

Article: England must have played against worse teams than this St Kitts Invitational XI but, after a day that descended into near farce, it is difficult to think of any. Warm-up games can be low-key affairs but there cannot have been many times when an international side have been pitched against a team as bad as this. St Kitts were simply shambolic, so bad that Chigwell Cricket Club could give them a decent game, and an almost tragic example of the steep decline of Caribbean cricket. They were simply not fit for purpose. Jos Buttler appeals for a stumping as England dominated the second day of a farcical match in St Kitts. Mark Wood looked lively in his early spell after he was brought in for his first bowl for England. The statistics will say that England, having bowled St Kitts out for 59 on the first day of their opening two-day tour match, rattled up 379 for six declared with both Alastair Cook and Ian Bell retiring out. Then St Kitts, given just one session to hang on, capitulated again and finished on 76 for seven, narrowly avoiding handing England a hollow victory. The match was drawn, just about, and it should also have been hung and quartered. The modern fixture madness that will see England play 17 Tests in the next 10 months makes proper warm-ups almost impossible and is one of the main reasons why home teams nearly always win Test series these days. But when they are as meaningless as this it is questionable why it is even worth bothering. England may have spent time in the middle but they may as well have just turned up in Antigua next week to play the first of three Tests. Wood celebrates his first England wicket, but he is probably still a way off getting a first Test cap. Alastair Cook acknowledges the crowd after making a century, shortly before being retired out. Jos Battler had a short go at attacking the home bowlers before England declared with a mammoth 320 lead. For what it is worth, Bell and Joe Root made untroubled half-centuries yesterday after Cook had moved to his first century for England since the Ashes warm-up in Hobart 18 months ago and promptly retired. Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler then had a bit of a bash before England declared at the fall of Stokes just before tea, the small matter of 320 ahead. Then, in a move which further devalued the authenticity of the ‘contest,’ England brought Liam Plunkett and Mark Wood into the match for a work out. Wood, the Durham fast bowler, looked lively in his first bowl for England off his minimalist run-up and earned his first wicket when he bowled Shane Jeffers but it is unlikely to be enough to earn him a first Test cap just yet. Gary Ballance looked out of touch, the only real problem for England in a very comfortable match. Liam Plunkett charges in as England reduced their hosts to 24 for six in farcical circumstances. When St Kitts plummeted to 24 for six and almost had a batsman timed out before he emerged just in time with the Velcro on his pads barely fastened, the home side’s embarrassment was almost complete. Yet at least they regained a semblance of pride by holding on as England gave their two spinners a decent bowl, Akeem Saunders and Leon Clarke doing most to keep England at bay. The only place in England’s first Test team yet to be decided, it seems, is between Adil Rashid and James Tredwell for the sole spinner’s slot and Tredwell was the clear winner here, taking three wickets to Rashid’s one. The Yorkshireman will need to have a very good second match to edge out Tredwell. James Tredwell (left) outperformed Adil Rashid in the contest to be England's Test spinner next week. Buttler makes an unconventional stop as England came close to winning the game in just two days. The only concern for England will be the form of Gary Ballance who looked out of touch before falling for 16, the legacy perhaps of a World Cup where he somehow became a symbol of England’s unimaginative one-day thinking. England’s desperate attempt to get as much as they can from the second of these two warm-ups will tomorrow see them bowl 90 overs at St Kitts whatever happens and then bat for 90 overs on Thursday. The first cricket score of 225 for 25 could be recorded at Warner Park tomorrow and the once proud reputation of Caribbean cricket will most likely take another hit. Truly, it is a sad state of affairs.

England reduce Invitational XI to 24 for six after amassing lead of 320. Hosts hold out for a draw, but the game had descended into a farce. England will learn little from glorified net against woeful opposition. James Tredwell out-bowls Adil Rashid in contest to be Test spinner.

Article: (CNN)The Tulsa County reserve deputy who fatally shot a man instead of using his Taser turned himself in to authorities Tuesday at the Tulsa County Jail. Video shows Reserve Deputy Robert Bates announcing he is going to deploy his Taser after an undercover weapons sting on April 2 but then shooting Eric Courtney Harris in the back with a handgun. Bates was charged with second-degree manslaughter Monday. He surrendered Tuesday morning, accompanied by his attorney, Clark Brewster, and immediately posted bail of $25,000. As he exited the jailhouse, Bates paused in front of television cameras for a moment but did not speak. His attorney reiterated that he believes the charge against his client is unwarranted. The Tulsa County Sheriff's Office says a sting operation caught Harris illegally selling a gun. Harris ran when officers came in for the arrest. Authorities say Bates thought he pulled out his Taser but "inadvertently" fired his gun. Harris' brother, Andre Harris, told CNN that he is pleased District Attorney Steve Kunzweiler pressed charges. In his opinion, however, no type of force should have been used in the arrest of his brother. Watching the video of the shooting, Andre Harris said he can see that three or more officers were already on top of his brother. That manpower should have been enough to arrest him, he said. "It was a situation where I didn't necessarily think that a Taser should even be used," Andre Harris said. Scott Wood, another Bates' attorney, has said the shooting was an "excusable homicide." Investigators' efforts to defend Bates and the other deputies involved in the arrest have sparked a mounting chorus of criticism online. Harris' relatives are demanding an independent investigation of what they call unjustified brutality. They're also questioning why the 73-year-old Bates -- the CEO of an insurance company who volunteers as a certified reserve deputy -- was on the scene in such a sensitive and high-risk sting operation. Daniel Smolen, an attorney representing the Harris family, said Bates paid big money to play a cop in his spare time. Bates, who was a police officer for a year in the 1960s, had been a reserve deputy since 2008, with 300 hours of training and 1,100 hours of community policing experience, according to the sheriff's office. He was also a frequent contributor to the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office, including $2,500 to the re-election of Sheriff Stanley Glanz. The sheriff's office has said that Bates had law enforcement certification, but Smolen said he has not seen any field training records. "We're holding up all right at this point," Andre Harris said. "We're putting our faith in God that justice will be served, and we can get some closure in this situation." How easy is it to confuse a gun for a Taser? In a statement released Tuesday, Eric Harris' family members said they know there are many good deputies working in Tulsa County. "However, the treatment of Eric of April 2 clearly shows that there is a deep-seated problem within the TCSO," the statement said. The family said that the sheriff has not apologized and that the department has not shown remorse or indication it will change its policies. CNN's Jason Morris and Ed Lavandera contributed to this report.

Life in the water: A bobcat was snapped hauling a shark along Sebastian Inlet State Park. However, Bailey told WPTV the bobcat might have been scared by his presence, since it scampered off toward the woods and let go of its find. Amy Kight, Busch Wildlife Sanctuary's Animal Care Director, told WPTV: 'My first reaction was amazement that somebody actually took that picture because bobcats are generally very, very reclusive. 'You don't really see them out and about too often.' A spokesman for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission has said she believes the image is genuine. FWC's Liz Barraco told WESH 'There is no reason to believe it's fake.' The bobcat exhibited typical behavior, FWC officials told the NBC affiliate station.

Article: (CNN)Laying down tracks for their debut album in the recording studio in Los Angeles, Iman Hashi, 25 and her sister Siham, 27 could not be further from their hometown of Mogadishu. The sisters were born in the Somali capital but were forced to flee after war broke out in 1991. Along with their parents, the girls relocated to Canada as refugees where during their teens they discovered a passion for music. Heading south to LA by way of Atlanta, the singing sisters with a bold flair for fashion are now embarking on a musical journey, gearing up to unleash their Afro-pop sound to the world. CNN's African Voices caught up with the sister act -- known collectively as Faarrow (combining the translation of their names into English -- Iman means "Faith" and Siham means "Arrow") to talk about music, aspirations and Somalia. CNN: Hi guys, thanks for chatting with me today. What are some of your musical influences? Iman: We love Michael Jackson, Lionel Richie -- stuff my mom would listen to and play -- and the Spice Girls. We used to die for the Spice Girls. I love new artists now but I don't know if it's a nostalgia, but I remember... my mom used to pump whatever -- Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston. CNN: You are working on your debut album now -- how's that been? Siham: We've been working with Elijah Kelley -- he's actually an actor. He was in "Hairspray," "The Butler," and most recently he was in the George Lucas animation, "Strange Magic." That's what he's more known for but his first passion is music. He's an incredible producer, writer and singer. I just felt like he was always the missing piece. He brought everything together. CNN: So now that you've found your "missing piece," how would you describe your sound? Siham: Our music before was experimenting with Afrobeat sounds but now it's more of a fusion (of what) we are inspired by. It's pop with undertones of hip hop and rhythmic African percussion. It's a fusion of everything. CNN: And do you guys write the songs as well? Siham: The entire album was pretty much (written and produced) by me, my sister and Elijah. And when we signed we already had a lot of those songs already done. Warner Brothers Records is really great in that way that they already loved what we were doing and let us do our own thing. CNN: What are you listening to right now? Siham: Oh my God, there's so many! Iman: Sia with "Chandelier." Siham: I really love this new song -- I don't know if Iman is going to agree with me -- but his name's LunchMoney Lewis, it's called Bills; I love it. CNN: As well as your music, you both work with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) -- how did you start your humanitarian work? Iman: Ever since we were kids we wanted to help Somalia, we always talked about it. But we were like "what can we physically do?" We were doing some research and we called our mom and she said 'You know you still have family over there. There's a refugee camp in Kenya and your great uncle and his kids live in a refugee camp.' And we did some research about Dadaab refugee camp, it's a massive camp that has taken in Sudanese refugees, Somali refugees, Rwandan refugees -- pretty much anywhere there was a conflict. Everybody fled to Dadaab. In the beginning (it was) pure advocacy talking about it on Twitter and Facebook. CNN: But then you decided to "up your game" as it were... Iman: Yes, then we started a non-profit and we'd do small benefit concerts in Toronto and in San Diego -- wherever there was a big Somali community we would do outreach but all we had was our singing, working with UNHCR in a capacity as a spokesperson. We headlined World Refugee Day at the Kennedy Center, as well as the Nansen Awards twice in Geneva. We felt like this platform of singing -- the bigger it gets, the more we can do. Siham: We obviously love fashion so we wanted to do our own socially conscious brand so we've been making these bracelets and necklaces called "Wish Creatively." Wish stands for "Women Internationally Selling Hope." We wanted to do a socially conscious brand where we sell these bracelets where it goes back to projects in Kenya or Somalia with women providing them with a sustainable income. CNN: So what's next for you two? Siham: We're actually in the mixing process right now. We still have a few (tracks) to finish up but the majority of the album is pretty much done. We want to turn it in as soon as possible so they can put together a rollout plan and get ready for the first single to drop. Iman: I don't feel like we ever lost that feeling like we're creative spokespersons for our generation as well as for Somalia. I feel like now because we followed our dreams it's like 'they're not just refugees anymore.' We don't have to become doctors so we can one day give back to Somalia and help rebuild -- it's such a beautiful dream but not ours. In our culture, anything creative is not really respected or appreciated. But I feel like now but even with our new deal we're still trucking along. I feel like we inspire people.

Article: Charlie Adam stunned the Premier League with a goal from his own half in Stoke's clash with Chelsea on Saturday evening. Here is a look back at some of the finest examples of the genre. Charlie Adam struck a stunning goal from inside his own half against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Thibaut Courtois was left helpless also his Chelsea side eventually went on to win 2-1. DAVID BECKHAM. The midfielder would go on to be a world-renowned, generational talent - but was only an emerging figure when, on the first day of the 1996-97 season, he spotted Wimbledon goalkeeper Neil Sullivan off his line and arced the ball perfectly over him and into the net to round off a 3-0 win. David Beckham struck from inside his own half for Manchester United against Wimbledon in 1996. Beckham celebrated the final goal in 3-0 win for United on the opening day of the 1996-97 season. JONE SAMUELSEN. An even greater rarity - a headed goal from a player in his own half. Samuelsen's Odd Grenland side were leading 2-1, Tromso's goalkeeper Andre Hansen was up for a corner and the ball was cleared towards Odd's centre forward. Defender Steffen Hagen nodded the ball away from him and just back across the halfway line, where Samuelsen met it with a powerful header which carried at least 30 yards and bounced into the unguarded net. Local police measured the goal at 58.13 metres, earning Samuelsen a spot in the Guinness Book of Records for the longest headed goal. XABI ALONSO. The Spanish midfielder actually achieved the feat twice in 2006 while with Liverpool - and once with each foot, for good measure. The left-footed effort was into an empty net, with Luton keeper Marlon Beresford up for a corner in injury time of an FA Cup tie the Reds won 5-3, but he then launched a flat lob over Newcastle keeper Steve Harper from the edge of the centre circle inside his own half in the Premier League. Xabi Alonso celebrates scoring from his own half for Liverpool against Newcastle in 2006. Steve Harper was helplessly beaten in the Newcastle goal by the Spanish midfielder's superb effort. STEFAN ISHIZAKI. The Elfsborg forward was out on the right sideline, a couple of yards inside his own half, when Orebro keeper Tomer Chencinski's clearance dropped to him. Ishizaki simply swung a first-time right foot volley at the ball, which bounced once in the middle of the penalty area before finding the top corner perfectly. MAYNOR FIGUEROA. The then-Wigan defender displayed great quick thinking against Stoke in 2009 when his side were awarded a free-kick near the halfway line. Robert Huth fouled Scott Sinclair and, with most of the players napping, Figueroa ran straight on to the stationary ball to blaze a shot over Thomas Sorensen and in. Wigan Athletic's Maynor Figueroa (second left) struck from behind halfway against Stoke in 2009. MORITZ STOPPELKAMP. Again, the Hannover goalkeeper was up for a free-kick, but that should not detract from Paderborn midfielder Stoppelkamp's achievement as the ball was cleared to him on the edge of his own penalty area and he simply controlled it on his chest, turned and volleyed the ball into the net from a scarcely believable 83 yards to make it 2-0. Moritz Stoppelkamp of Paderborn (centre) celebrates his stunning goal against Hanover in September 2014. CHARLIE ADAM. The Stoke man has previous for this kind of behaviour, having showcased the skill during two loan spells from Rangers earlier in his career. An effort for Blackpool's reserves was just inside the Accrington half, but one for Ross County against St Mirren in 2007 was just about on the line - close enough to give him the benefit of the doubt, in any case. Adam (right) celebrates with his Stoke City team-mates after scoring at Stamford Bridge on Saturday.

Article: Baghdad, Iraq (CNN)Hundreds of additional Iraqi troops are being sent to reinforce colleagues who are trying to fend off ISIS' attempt to overrun Iraq's largest oil refinery, a key paramilitary force said Tuesday. The reinforcements come four days after ISIS began attacking northern Iraq's Baiji oil refinery, a key strategic resource that has long been a target because the facility refines much of the fuel used by Iraqis domestically. The additional troops came from Camp Speicher, a fortified Iraqi base near the city of Tikrit, according to the media office of the Hasd Al-Shaabi militia. The reinforcements include two federal police regiments, an Iraqi military quick reaction force battalion and a regiment from Hasd Al-Shaabi, which is a predominantly Shia militia that worked with the Iraqi military as well as Sunni fighters to liberate Tikrit from ISIS about two weeks ago. ISIS launched an assault on the Baiji oil refinery late Saturday. By Sunday, ISIS said its fighters were inside the refinery and controlled several buildings, but Iraqi government security officials denied that claim and insisted that Iraqi forces remained in full control. The Hasd Al-Shaabi media office said Tuesday that Iraqi troops already at the refinery were holding their ground, preparing to push ISIS out of the facility entirely. The attack could have a significant effect if it damages oil fields or machinery. The refinery is 40 kilometers (25 miles) from Tikrit. CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali reported from Baghdad. CNN's Jason Hanna wrote in Atlanta. CNN's Arwa Damon and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.

Article: Jack Colback admits Newcastle United's supporters are being left short-changed as the club's sorry season threatens to plunge new depths. The 25-year-old says he is already looking forward to next term given the slump in form which has seen the Magpies lose five on the spin and score just one goal in eight hours. But before this season is out Colback and his team-mates will have to endure planned protests with a boycott of Sunday's match against Spurs set to see thousands stay away from St James’ Park. Jack Colback (left) says the Newcastle United fans deserve more following another disappointing defeat. Newcastle lost six in a row at the same stage 12 months ago and the atmosphere inside the ground was toxic during the final home game as fans targeted manager Alan Pardew and owner Mike Ashley. One year on and John Carver’s threadbare squad is in real danger of being sucked into a relegation scrap should their ruinous run continue. And Colback accepts that their current effort is far from the standard required. The midfielder was one of the only players who deserves credit this season and put in a shift against Liverpool. ‘This is a huge club which deserves more than it is getting at the moment,’ said the midfielder, who was part of another lacklustre display during Monday’s 2-0 defeat at Liverpool. ‘It’s a difficult situation we’re in – we’ve not got a lot of players. ‘But we can’t feel sorry for ourselves. We’ve got to make sure we perform this weekend. ‘If we play like we did in spells (at Liverpool) then we can pick up the wins we need to get this season out of the way and look to progress next year.’ Carver says Ashley has promised him that the squad will undergo major renovation work this summer. Moussa Sissoko was sent off for a terrible tackle on Lucas Leiva to add to John Carver's woes. The head coach has raised concerns about the character of the players after they lost a fifth straight Tyne-Wear derby last weekend. But Colback said: ‘The character is there in the team, even though we didn’t show it last week (at Sunderland). ‘We had to show a reaction at Liverpool because last week was nowhere near good enough. ‘The minimum we could do is be better than the last game and I thought we were. ‘We should have done better with their first goal and it was a shame we took until then to react. We created the odd chance. ‘The penalty decision (Ayoze Perez was fouled by Dejan Lovren with the score at 1-0) was massive, it might have been a different game if we’d got that. Nothing seems to be going our way at the moment. Ayoze Perez (centre) was denied a stonewell penalty by under-fire referee Lee Mason in the first half. ‘But we’re not going to get any sympathy, we’ve still lost the game.’ Carver, meanwhile, will turn to Siem de Jong in a bid to save the season. The £6million signing was only days away from returning after a five-month layoff with a torn thigh muscle when he suffered a collapsed lung in February. De Jong – who has made just one Premier League start – was expected to miss the remainder of the campaign given that it was the second time he had fallen victim to the problem. However, the 26-year-old returned to training earlier this month and will now feature for United’s reserves when they entertain Derby County this evening. Siem de Jong is in line to feature for the under-21's on Wednesday and his return would be a welcome boost.

Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) deployed the remote-controlled robot on Friday inside one of the damaged reactors that had suffered a meltdown following a devastating earthquake and tsunami in 2011. It was the first time the probe had been used. The robot, set out to collect data on radiation levels and investigate the spread of debris, stalled after moving about 10 meters, according to a statement released by TEPCO. A newly released report and footage from the robot shows that a fallen object had blocked its path and left it stranded. TEPCO decided to cut off the cable connected to the device Sunday as it had already covered two-thirds of the originally planned route. It managed to collect data on radiation levels in 14 of the 18 targeted locations. Four years after the devastating nuclear crisis, the radiation levels inside the three damaged reactors are still extremely high and remain unsafe for people to enter. Decommissioning work is estimated to cost $50 billion and will take years to complete. TEPCO called the robotic probe an "unprecedented" experiment. CNN's Yoko Wakatsuki reported from Tokyo, Japan and Naomi Ng wrote from Hong Kong.

Article: A newly-released video has highlighted the shocking - and arguably discriminatory - price differences between near-identical products and everyday services offered to women and men,. The clip, which was created by HLN's The Daily Share, illustrates the prevalence of this 'women's tax' to shocking affect by directly comparinga variety of different products and services aimed at men and women and then revealing the price differences. Even more disappointing is that this practice of 'invisible tax' is not only found almost everywhere, but it is entirely legal in almost every state in the US - even when the products or services are exactly the same for both genders. Scroll down for video. That price could use a shave: The Daily Share found that the differences between these razors of the same brand differed by more than a dollar between the men's and women's versions. Compounded with the fact that women make, on average, 78 cents on the dollar to men, the facts prove than gender bias is more than just offensive, it's also very expensive. For example, a Schick’s Hydro 5 men’s razor was picked up for $8.56, but the women's version - the Schick Hydro Silk - was, for some reason, given more than a one dollar mark-up, and was priced at $9.97. An even greater disparity was found in the perfume aisle, where Narciso Rodriguez Eau de Toilettes For Him and For Her respectively cost $87 and $106.60. Meanwhile, a pair of Neutrogena anti-aging creams with the exact same ingredients were also found to inexplicably cost women $1.07 more per ounce - despite the skincare brand admitting that the two products were essentially the exact same product encased in different packaging. One of the few equal prices found by the video's creators was, of course, on a unisex American Apparel shirt. But when a man and a woman each dropped off the exact same shirt to get dry-cleaned, the woman was charged an extra 75 cents - and the tag even labelled the laundered item as a 'Lady Shirt'. Something smells fishy: There is almost a ful 20 dollar difference between the his and hers versions of this brand of cologne. Seriously? The presenters claim that the exact same shirt dropped off at a dry cleaners cost more to clean when a woman brought it in. The two presenters do point out that conditions are getting slightly better; medical insurance used to cost women in America $1 billion more each year before ObamaCare outlawed the practice of gender-biased pricing discrimination. However, in terms of everyday gender-taxing across the country, a 1995 report found that 'gender tax' cost women approximately $1,351 annually - a number which doesn't show any signs of decreasing any time soon. And while the shocking statistics in the caused California to put a state-wide ban on the practice in 1996, with New York City also opting to impose a similar ban on gender pricing, the rest of the US continues to allow the practice. Even something as basic as long-term care insurance costs women 13 per cent more, a hike they apparently base on the fact that women have longer life-spans - in the same way that they raise rates on smokers. 'But people choose to smoke,' says the female presenter. 'I didn't choose to be a woman.'

The clip, which was created by The Daily Share, compares near-identical products for men and women and highlights the price differences. According to the creators of the video, California is one of the few states to have put a ban on 'gender pricing discrimination'

Article: (CNN)More than 500 Houthi rebels have been killed since the start of Saudi-led military operations against Yemeni Shia fighters, a Saudi Defense Ministry official said Saturday, according to the state-run Saudi Press Agency. A Saudi general said Saturday the nine-nation coalition has undertaken 1,200 airstrikes since they began on March 26. Gen. Ahmed Asiri added that the raids aim to keep the rebels from moving toward southern Yemen,  according to the SPA. Clashes took place Friday near the Saudi-Yemeni border, in the Najran region. Saudi forces responded to mortar rounds fired by Houthis on a Saudi border site. Three Saudi military officers were killed and two others were wounded in the shelling, a defense official said, according to SPA. A Saudi source also confirmed to CNN's Nic Robertson that three Saudi soldiers were killed in the shelling. The Yemeni Health Ministry on Saturday said 385 civilians have been killed and 342 others have been wounded. The World Health Organization has put higher figure on both tolls -- 648 killed and 2,191 wounded -- but includes militant casualties in the totals. Yemen has been descending into chaos in the weeks since Houthi rebels -- minority Shiites who have long complained of being marginalized in the majority Sunni country -- forced Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi from power in January. And even before the crisis escalated with the Saudi airstrikes, most of the 25 million people in Yemen required humanitarian assistance to meet their most basic needs, the United Nations said Friday. CNN's Pierre Meilhan and Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.

Article: Masters Wednesday began on a sombre note when Australian Marc Leishman, who got so close to victory in 2013 before finishing tied fourth behind countryman Adam Scott, had to withdraw. His wife Audrey spent part of last week in an induced coma owing to a serious infection. Leishman left Augusta taking with him the best wishes of his sport. Marc Leishman has withdrawn from this year's competition to be with his wife. Masters chairman Billy Payne talked a lot  about growing the game but he ruled out any idea of starting a women’s Masters. ‘We have a very short member season at Augusta National of seven months,’ he explained. ‘The time that we dedicate to the preparation and conduct of the tournament is already extensive. I don’t think we would ever host another one.’ Billy Payne has ruled out starting a women's Masters despite talking about growing the game. It’s well-known the garish surroundings outside Augusta National contrast markedly with the beauty within. But maybe that’s about to change. After buying up all the houses on adjacent Berckmans Road and turning it into a patrons’ car park, Masters chairman Billy Payne is promising a ‘beautification’ project. ‘As you know, we’re pretty good at landscaping,’ he said. ‘It’s going to look nice, I promise.’ Mr Unpopular Bubba Watson can surely not have upset anyone with his choice of menu for the Champions Dinner on Tuesday. Clearly he enjoyed it so much two years ago he decided to stick with the same inoffensive offering: Caesar salad followed by grilled chicken breast with green beans, mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese and cornbread. Bubba Watson was recently voted the most unpopular golfer on tour by his fellow professionals. Favourite pic of the week so far? It might well be Arnold Palmer, clad in his green jacket, snapped under the Oak Tree in front of the clubhouse alongside Niall Horan, the keen golf-playing member of One Direction but better known in these parts as Rory McIlroy’s par three caddy. Talk about a game that spans the generations. Arnold Palmer shakes hands with Niall Horan ahead of the 79th instalment of the Masters. The famous Eisenhower Tree on the 17th hole might have gone following an ice storm last year but it has certainly not been forgotten. The club unveiled a mounted cross-section of the tree that will remain on show in the press building this week before being presented to the Eisenhower Library in Kansas for permanent display. The tree was named after the American President after he kept hitting it with his drives. A section of the Eisenhower tree is displayed during a news conference at the Masters. Jack Nicklaus showed he’s still got it at the age of 75 with a hole in one at the fourth in the Par-3 contest. But he couldn’t match Colombian Camilo Villegas who recorded two, at the fourth and eighth. Camilo Villegas recorded two aces during the Par-3 contest, beating Jack Nicklaus' solitary hole-in-one.

Article: Hong Kong (CNN)There's a booming black market in Hong Kong, but it's not for fake Apple Watches, or the iPhone. Instead, people are going crazy for tins of butter cookies. Tourists and locals line up around the block for several hours just to get their hands on Jenny's cookies -- at $9 a tin. Its popularity has spurred bakeries to make and sell knockoffs, and the original store has signs warning against buying 'fake' Jenny's cookies. The tiny shop, located in Tsim Sha Tsui, one of the city's main shopping districts, is swarming with people handing over wads of cash for the "little bear cookies" as they are known across Asia. People are even hired to stand in line to buy the goods and are later resold at a 70% mark-up yards away, something the bakery also tries to discourage. A few meters away from the long cookie line, old ladies hold up paper signs advertising the cookies for sale. But when they see cameras approaching, they scurry away, only to reappear on another street corner. The frenzy in Hong Kong over the buttery treats is by no means an isolated example. In other parts of the world, food mania has erupted, swiftly winning people's hearts and stomachs, only to fizzle out in a few months. From cronuts to ramen burgers, here are some foods that people around the world have spent hours of their lives waiting for. Were they worth it?

Article: Tim Sherwood and Chris Ramsey may become a united force again in seasons to come. They could continue as rival managers. Whatever happens, they will remember this night when they went toe to toe for 90 minutes of top-flight football. There was adrenaline, action, twists and turns. It was good to see two English coaches who have come up through the ranks against each other in a match of this importance. Their teams’ Premier League statuses were not decided on Tuesday night, but this felt like a sliding-doors moment that directed their paths. Tim Sherwood and Chris Ramsey embrace each other as they met at Villa Park on Tuesday night. There was adrenaline, action, twists and turns as Ramsey and Sherwood went head to head at Villa Park. Queens Park Rangers led, then Aston Villa led, then Charlie Austin gave QPR a taste of victory before Christian Benteke wiped it away with his hat-trick goal. It was absorbing stuff on the pitch as well as in the technical areas, where Sherwood and Ramsey stood. They shuffled and shouted, cajoled and pointed. Never during the match did they exchange glances, perhaps too afraid to look the other in the eye and give the game away. Sherwood and Ramsey’s relationship was forged over four years at Tottenham. They helped bring through young talent; Sherwood predominantly picking and motivating, Ramsey mainly coaching. Harry Kane, Ryan Mason and Nabil Bentaleb are part of their Spurs legacy. Now Premier League bosses, they still live 10 minutes apart in Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire. They have been for pints this season and will do so again in the future no doubt, unpicking this game that had so much at stake. Sherwood tore his jacket off as he celebrated his team's goal en route to Christian Benteke's hat-trick. Sherwood throws his jacket as he celebrates the goal at Villa Park in the relegation battle. Sherwood was out at pitchside much earlier than his friend and rival, so he waited and watched as Ramsey, jacket wrapped around his waist, strode out on his own from tunnel to dugout. The Villa boss extended his hand and there was a warm embrace between the two men as an arc of photographers snapped away nearby. Sherwood wore his customary gilet. In the seventh minute it was unzipped, three minutes later it was ripped off and flung to the floor. The timings coincided with QPR’s opening goal, and Villa’s equaliser. Think Temuri Ketsbaia minus the hoarding kicks. Sherwood, as we have become accustomed, was living the match on the edge. Unafraid to hype its importance before kick-off, he was treating it as such once the whistle blew. The showdown between Sherwood (left) and Ramsey (right) ended in a 3-3 draw at Villa Park. By half-time we had seen the full show. In the 16th minute he placed his hands on his head when QPR keeper Rob Green saved from Jack Grealish. In the 24th he hurried his players to take a free-kick. Soon after he was telling fans behind his dugout to calm down after Grealish delivered a poor corner. He produced his double-fisted pump celebration after Benteke’s second, the one we saw during the latter stages of the FA Cup win over West Brom. Sherwood was more restrained in the second period, particularly when Clint Hill found a leveller. Austin’s strike left him shellshocked before Benteke put a smile back on his face. With six games to go, both men have much to think about.

Article: Kano, Nigeria (CNN)An explosion late Thursday outside a bus station in the northeast Nigerian city of Gombe ‎killed at least five people and injured more than a dozen others, witnesses said. The explosion outside the Bauchi Motor Park‎ happened around 8:30 p.m. after a woman left her explosives-laden handbag near a bus filling up with passengers. The bus was heading to the central Nigerian city of Jos, 125 kilometers away. "There has been an explosion just outside the motor park and five people have been killed while more than 12 others have been seriously injured," said Adamu Saidu, an employee at the bus station. "Some of the injured have had their limbs blown off‎ and one of them has had his eye gouged out," said Saidu, who was involved in the evacuation of the victims to a hospital. The woman pretended to be going to Jos and lingered around the bus, which was ‎waiting to fill up with passengers, according to Falalu Tasiu, a grocer near the bus station. "The woman kept talking on the phone and dropped her bag beside the bus, pretending to be waiting for the bus to fill up," Tasiu said. "She moved towards shops overlooking the bus station as if she was going to buy something and disappeared. Moments later the bag exploded and set the bus on fire, killing five people and inujuring around 15 others," Tasiu said. Although no one has claimed responsibility for the attack, Boko Haram Islamists have repeatedly carried out suicide and bombing attacks on bus stations and markets in Gombe and other northern cities, making the group the main suspect. Boko Haram has in recent months been under sustained pressure from sweeping offensives from a four-nation regional alliance of Nigeria, Chad, Niger and Cameroon. The regional offensives have considerably weakened Boko Haram's capabilities, which has prompted the Islamists to resort to attacks on soft targets such as bus stations, markets and schools. The explosion was the first attack since Nigeria held its presidential election at the weekend, which was won by opposition candidate Muhammadu Buhari, who vowed to crush Boko Haram when he assumes office in late May.

Article: Washington (CNN)ISIS is a problem that is "off the charts historically" and has sent the United States into "uncharted territory" when it comes to putting down the terror group, the Obama administration's point man in the fight recently told CNN. The comments, which Brett McGurk made in an exclusive interview, were some of the administration's strongest to date in describing the challenge the United States and its allies face in battling ISIS. "This is a problem that is off the charts historically," he said, referring to the more than 20,000 foreign fighters who have gone into Syria. "Just put that into perspective: It's about twice the number that went into Afghanistan in the 1980s over a 10-year period to fight the Soviet Union, and those came really from only a handful of countries." He concluded, "We're in unchartered territory here." McGurk just returned from an urgent summit of coalition nations held in Jordan. Last week, Canada became the latest nation to conduct airstrikes against ISIS over Syria. The United States now lists 62 countries in the coalition. As the U.S.-led coalition has focused attention on Iraq and Syria, ISIS has expanded its reach to Libya, Egypt and Yemen, often with existing extremist groups pledging allegiance to the militants. McGurk did not rule out expanding U.S. military action beyond Iraq and Syria to combat the increasing regional threat. "We have a lot of tools to protect ourselves and our national security interests, some of which are military tools," he said. "Of course we apply those tools when the president determines and our chain of command makes the recommendation that that is the right thing to do." The United States has also been stepping up efforts to involve Sunni groups in the fight against ISIS. To date, that involvement has been extremely limited as Sunni tribes see Shiite militias, many with horrendous human rights records, take the lead. But McGurk said that Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi is making progress getting Sunni tribes to support a planned Iraqi offensive against ISIS in Anbar province in the coming weeks. He stressed the importance of working with al-Abadi, noting that the Iraqi leader was in Anbar province last week handing out more than 1,000 AK-47s to tribal fighters who are going to join the Iraqi security forces. "We are helping to enable and train (them) as they begin to go on the offensive over the coming weeks and months in Anbar," McGurk said. "They put out this very perverse, twisted vision, and it's very attractive to a lot of young men around the world," he acknowledged. "But in fact, what the foreign fighters are finding in Syria and Iraq is that they're more likely to get killed in Iraq and Syria, and in fact, instead of getting a slave bride as ISIS leaders promise them, they're more likely to get killed by a female Peshmerga fighter in the streets of Kobani." That bottom line, he assessed, could turn the tide: "The foreign fighters are learning the reality of what it's like when they go to join this twisted version of a caliphate, and I think we're going to see those networks begin to dry up."

Article: Jenson Button believes McLaren now have their rivals in their sights ahead of this weekend's Chinese Grand Prix. After starting the new Formula One season in Australia with a severe lack of pace, McLaren and new power-unit supplier Honda made significant progress a fortnight later in Malaysia. Although both Button and team-mate Fernando Alonso retired during the race at the Sepang International Circuit, the duo at least discovered the car was competitive alongside other midfield runners. Jenson Button looks on in the garage during final practice for last month's Malaysian Grand Prix. That came as a pleasant surprise to Button, who is now hoping further steps have been taken going into this weekend's race in Shanghai. 'Obviously we want to finish a race, but seeing improvement in pace was much more important,' said Button. 'Yes, we both had failures, but I'd rather that with us pushing and trying to get more power out of the car than trotting around at the back and simply getting to the end. 'To be able to race other cars, and see the Red Bulls until a long way into the race, was good. 'We would probably have been 20 seconds behind them. I know they're not quick, but that is a good step forward for us. Button returns to the McLaren garage after retiring during the race at the Sepang circuit. 'Right now we're comparing ourselves with the Force Indias, Saubers and Lotuses. 'We were quicker than Force India; the Sauber was on the same sort of pace, and the Lotus wasn't that much quicker. 'Fighting with the pack is important for me. It's what I enjoy and hopefully race by race we'll start picking them off.' Despite the positives, Button acknowledges the entire team, including Honda,'still has a long way to go'. British driver Button in action before he retired from the Malaysian Grand Prix. Button added: 'We need and want more downforce to fight with the guys around us, and we still have a lot to do with the power unit, but our basic car is good. 'If you look at our high-speed pace, compared to the Force India and Sauber, then we are much stronger. 'So we're moving in the right direction, and I'm already surprised we are racing cars. It's great to see.' Part of the reasoning behind McLaren's improvement in Malaysia, in comparison to Australia, was the high temperatures which suited the car. McLaren driver Fernando Alonso (left) drives ahead of team-mate Button in Kuala Lumpur. Button appreciates the cooler air in Shanghai could have an effect. The 35-year-old said: 'There is a feeling the expected cooler weather will make it harder to generate tyre temperature. 'That could mean any progress we make doesn't necessarily translate to a lap-time benefit. 'But there is definitely progress being made, and it's great to be able to play a role in helping move the whole team forwards. 'It'll be fascinating to see how much change we can effect over the forthcoming races.'

Article: (CNN)The first trailer for a documentary on the life and music of late British singer Amy Winehouse was released Thursday. The teaser for "Amy: The Girl Behind the Name," set for UK release on July 3, features early footage of Winehouse talking about how her music career was born and where she believed she was headed. "Singing has always been important to me, but I never thought, 'I'll end up singing' or 'I'll be a singer,' " Winehouse said. "I felt like I had nothing new that was coming out at the time that really represented me or the way I felt, so, you know, I just started writing." Winehouse, known for her bluesy voice, bouffant hairdo and numerous tattoos, struggled publicly with drugs and alcohol during a career in which she recorded two albums and won six Grammys (one posthumous). She died from alcohol poisoning at the age of 27 on July 23, 2011. Her biggest hit, "Rehab," chronicled the efforts of those around her to get her to submit to substance abuse treatment. "Amy" seeks to "truly capture not just the great artist that she was, but also the funny and loving person that most people didn't get a chance to know," the filmmakers said on Facebook after announcing the film in 2013. Amy Winehouse documentary gets UK release date. The trailer conveys Winehouse's ambivalence about fame. "I'm not a girl trying to be a star or trying to be anything other than a musician," she says. "I don't think I'm gonna be at all famous," Winehouse tells an interviewer early in her career. "I don't think I could handle it. I would probably go mad. Do you know what I mean? I would go mad." A life cut short: Remembering the tragedy of Amy Winehouse. Unlike an earlier look at the singer's life, 2013's "Fallen Star," the documentary has been endorsed by Winehouse's family. It will feature "extensive unseen archive footage and previously unheard tracks," Deadline reported. The team behind the new film includes Asif Kapadia, director of the documentary "Senna," on the life of Brazilian Formula 1 racer Ayrton Senna. The film won two BAFTA awards. "The award-winning producers of Senna presented a vision that would look at Amy's story sensitively, honestly and without sensationalising her," the family statement said. "We want this to be a tribute to her musical legacy."' A U.S. release date for the film has yet to be announced. CNN's Michael Pearson contributed to this report.

Article: Boston (CNN)The Boston Marathon is traditionally an event in which people in and around the Massachusetts capital come together, celebrate and enjoy. But not in 2013, when three people died and over 200 were injured when a pair of bombs went off within 12 seconds of each other at the finish line. And not this year -- at least not if you're a member of the jury that convicted Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in the bombings. That's what federal Judge George A. O'Toole told jurors Tuesday, stressing the importance of avoiding anything that could be prejudicial in the trial's sentencing phase. That begins April 21, a day after this year's edition of the landmark race. "Do not attend the Boston Marathon or any events or gatherings related to the anniversary or the current running of the Boston Marathon," O'Toole said in court. The judge spoke for less than 10 minutes, and stressed the seriousness of his warnings. The first phase of Tsarnaev's trial began March 4, after which federal prosecutors called 92 witnesses, and the defense just four. Timeline of the bombings, manhunt and aftermath. Tsarnaev's lawyers never disputed that their client was at the scene of the bombings and part of the days-long mayhem that followed. Tsarnaev lawyer Judy Clarke acknowledged in opening arguments that: "It was him." But Clarke argued that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev only took part in the plot under the influence of his brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who died after the bombings, but before his brother was captured in a boat parked in a Watertown backyard,. That argument wasn't enough to sway the jury, though. Rather, they convicted Dzhokhar Tsarnaev on all 30 counts he faced -- including using weapons of mass destruction, bombing a place of public use, conspiracy and aiding and abetting. A look at all of the charges. The only question now, short of a successful appeal of that verdict, is what price he'll now pay. The maximum penalty for several of the charges is death. Talking to the jury on Tuesday, O'Toole predicted that the sentencing phase will last four weeks before cautioning that forecasting a specific timetable is less reliable than guessing the weather. The plan is for the court to be in session for four days a week, as long as the process takes. Until then, O'Toole told the jurors, "Please put the case out of your minds. Enjoy the warm weather."

Article: Most parents have the souvenir of a scan of their child in the womb at 12 weeks. The must-have for IVF mums and dads these days, however, is a video and pictures right from the moment of conception. The images are thanks to revolutionary technology that allows medics to record the microscopic miracle of life – from fertilisation to the division of cells, right through to the growth of an embryo. Hundreds of parents are now the proud owners of these EmbryoScope images, which are also helping scientists learn more about the IVF process. Scroll down for video. Pictured is the very first cell division of Pixie Morley, now aged nine months, taken using the revolutionary EmbryoScope technology. Sally and Stephen Morley (pictured with their daughter Pixie) are one of some 1,500 couples in Britain who have had babies using EmbryoScope technology. Sally and Stephen Morley are among them. The grainy grey and white picture on this page shows the first cell division in the creation of their IVF baby, Pixie. A tiny camera, placed inside an incubator, films the reproduction process. As well as allowing parents to watch back the moment the embryos form, the technology – developed in the US – also allows experts to select the best possible embryos based on how they form during the conception process. This narrows a mother’s chance of miscarrying. The Morleys, from Walsall, had spent months trying to have children naturally before opting for IVF. Mrs Morley, 38, the head of a nursery, said: ‘I knew time was against me being 36 when we started trying so when I failed to get pregnant each month I knew we should have fertility tests as soon as possible.’ While the couple were undergoing IVF, the EmbryoScope technology was introduced at the Midland Fertility Clinic, allowing them to be the first in their area to capture their child’s conception on camera. The technology allows medics and parents to watch the cell dividing. Pictured is the cell division of now nine-month-old Pixie. In October 2013, the embryo was transferred into Mrs Morley’s womb and within two weeks she was told by doctors that the process had been successful. Now, nine months after Pixie’s birth, she is still able to re-watch the moment her daughter was conceived. Experts have hailed the technology as one of the most important developments in IVF. Professor Simon Fishel, who is boss of Care Fertility, the first clinic in Britain to use the EmbryoScope, said: ‘We now know that embryos that do make babies and embryos that don’t make babies do different things. 'And to be able to see this in a time-matched movie and to be able to analyse it scientifically is absolutely wonderful science for us.’ Professor Fishel, who was part of the team that produced first test-tube baby, Louise Brown, in 1978, said the EmbryoScope was revealing the secrets about what happens to embryos as they develop – and why it is that around 70 per cent of them do not actually make babies. The videos were also an emotional milestone in the process of becoming a parent, Professor Fishel said. ‘The couple can see the process of fertilisation, see the cells divide, see the number of cells grow and see them produce an embryo…it is nothing short of observing the wonderful miracle of life.’ The video given to parents is a sped-up version of the process which occurs before the embryo develops. Professor Fishel said his patients were ‘awestruck’ when given the footage but that the clinic only gave parents the video once a mother had fallen pregnant. He added that, at across the Care Fertility clinics, 1,000 couples, who had gone on to have a baby, had been given footage of their embryo’s development.

Article: (CNN)A former U.S. Army enlistee who posted on Facebook about "the adrenaline rush" of dying in jihad was arrested Friday and charged with trying to detonate a car bomb at Fort Riley military base in Kansas, authorities said. A second man, who allegedly knew about the bomb plot but didn't call authorities, was charged with failing to report a felony. John T. Booker Jr. of Topeka, an American citizen also known as Mohammed Abdullah Hassan, was taken into custody near Manhattan, Kansas, in a van that contained what he thought was a bomb, the criminal complaint said. The "bomb" had actually been put together by two confidential informants with nonexplosive materials, the complaint said. Fort Riley's security was never breached and no people were in danger, the U.S. Justice Department said in a press release. Booker enlisted in the Army last year and was due to ship out to basic training April 7, 2014, said Army spokesman Wayne Hall. The criminal complaint said the FBI questioned him March 24, 2014 about comments posted on Facebook, such as, "Getting ready to be killed in jihad is a HUGE adrenaline rush. I am so nervous. NOT because I'm scare to die but I am eager to meet my lord." Booker waived his Miranda rights and told the agents he enlisted to commit an insider attack against American soldiers like Maj. Nidal Hassan had done at Fort Hood, Texas, the complaint said. Hassan opened fire in a building in November 2009, killing 13 people and wounding more than 30. His enlistment was terminated March 24, 2014, at the request of Army Criminal Investigation Command, Hall said. Booker began communicating with a confidential informant later in 2014, the complaint said, and often talked about his plans to engage in violent jihad in support of ISIS. He and the informant watched ISIS videos together, the complaint said, and Booker talked about how he wanted to go to Iraq and turn his weapon on American soldiers when ordered to shoot the enemy. On March 9, Booker said he believed ISIS wanted him to commit a truck bombing in the United States and thought a good target would be nearby Fort Riley, a large Army base that's home to the 1st Infantry Division, known as "The Big Red One." Booker said "that detonating a suicide bomb is his No. 1 aspiration because he couldn't be captured, all evidence would be destroyed and he would be guaranteed to hit his target,"  the criminal complaint said. He made a video with a Fort Riley airfield in the background and said ISIS was coming to kill American soldiers, both abroad and in the United States, the complaint said. Booker acquired components for a bomb and rented a storage locker to store the components, the complaint said. The plan was for confidential informants to build a bomb and for Booker to drive to Fort Riley and detonate it, the complaint said. But the bomb was built with "inert" parts and would never explode, the complaint said. On Friday, the informants and Booker drove to what Booker thought was a little-used utility gate near Fort Riley, the complaint said. While Booker was making final connections on the "bomb," the FBI arrested him, the complaint said. He was charged with one count of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction, one count of attempting to damage property by means of an explosive and one count of attempting to provide material support to the Islamic State of Iraq, a designated foreign terrorist organization. If convicted, he could face life in prison. Alexander E. Blair, 28, of Topeka was taken into custody Friday and charged with failing to report a felony. The FBI said agents interviewed Blair after Booker's arrest. Blair said he shared some of Booker's views, knew of his plans to detonate a vehicle bomb at Fort Riley and loaned him money to rent storage space, according to the FBI's criminal complaint. He said he thought Booker would carry out his plan but did not contact authorities, the complaint said. If convicted, Blair faces a maximum of three years in prison.

Article: Who has been Liverpool’s player of the season? Had you asked that question 12 months ago, the answer would have been glaring: Luis Suarez. For his 31 goals and his breathtaking displays, the accolade could only have gone to the Uruguayan. It was not, though, a case of him operating alone. Had it been a ‘normal’ season, Steven Gerrard, Daniel Sturridge, Philippe Coutinho and Raheem Sterling would all have been worthy recipients. But they were not the only contenders. Jordan Henderson was outstanding. Martin Skrtel was a big presence. Luis Suarez was clearly Liverpool's player of last season after the striker scored 31 goals in the campaign. Steven Gerrard (left) and Phillippe Coutinho (front) also played well as Liverpool's title tilt fell short. The Brazilian playmaker put in a real all-action display for his team. As well as scoring the winner, he had the most shots, most touches, the highest duel success, highest dribble completion, and the most tackles. Fast forward to the present and ask the same question: who has been Liverpool’s player of the season? There is no obvious candidate. Henderson, of course, would have his backers. The England international has excelled since the turn of the year, while Coutinho would command his share of the vote. Brendan Rodgers suggested after the Brazilian’s fabulous goal against Manchester City on March 1 he might be a contender for PFA Young Player of Year but, at times since, his flame has not flickered so brightly. Sterling had three blistering months when his goals were key to reviving fortunes. Emre Can has caught the eye since Christmas, while results have been better with Lucas Leiva in the team; Liverpool have only suffered three defeats in the 23 matches he has started. And that explains why Liverpool are where they are at the moment. There have been lots of satisfactory contributions, a few excellent, but there hasn’t been anywhere near the consistency of 12 months ago. Jordan Henderson has chipped in with some important goals and impressed with his boundless energy. Coutinho has again played well and won the game for Liverpool to send them into the FA Cup semi-finals. Coutinho has popped up with some important goals this season — five of his six strikes have earned Liverpool results (four wins and a draw). It is why they find themselves on the wrong side of the line for Champions League places and why they have made such heavy weather of this FA Cup campaign. For long periods here they flattered to deceive. Sterling saw little of the ball and Sturridge continued to show how out of form he is. The goals have dried up for Rodgers’ side over the course of the last month — they had only scored seven in their previous six matches before this game. Rodgers must have feared the worst as Simon Mignolet kept his side’s Wembley dreams alive with two stunning saves early in the second period, but then, much to his relief, up popped Coutinho. There is still time, of course, for one of Rodgers’ squad to emerge as the absolute best of this bunch; on May 19, a gala dinner will be held at the city’s Echo Arena when the successor to Suarez will be announced. Daniel Sturridge's injury-hit season has been a tempestuous affair for the out-of-sorts striker. Raheem Sterling was denied of service at Ewood Park during a frustrating display for the contract rebel. At this moment, nobody is better placed than Coutinho. If Liverpool are going to clamber into the top four — still a possibility given Liverpool’s implosion — and win the FA Cup, much will depend on the little Brazilian. He proved he had what it takes to settle a frantic collision at Ewood Park. Rodgers needs him to show that right through until the end of May.

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence.
Luis Suarez was Liverpool's player of last season. But who would earn that accolade this year? Jordan Henderson has many backers, as does Coutinho. Several, among them Emre Can and Raheem Sterling, have shone in parts. There have been lots of adequate contributions but there hasn't been anywhere near enough consistency. If Liverpool are going to clamber into the top four and win the FA Cup, much will depend on the little Brazilian.

Article: (CNN)Gwyneth Paltrow, the actress turned lifestyle guru, is known for promoting detoxes and health cleanses on her site, Goop.com. But she's now bringing awareness to the difficulties of life on food stamps. In a tweet Friday, Paltrow showcased an array of leafy greens, dried beans and rice, purchased for the amount a person living on food stamps is allotted each week, she explained. The amount of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits a person can get is based on the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Thrifty Food Plan. The plan estimates how much it costs to buy food, according to the United States Department of Agriculture. In this case, Paltrow will be spending just under $30 for groceries. Her participation is part of the #FoodBankNYCChallenge. Celebrity chef Mario Batali, a close friend of the star's, nominated Paltrow and musicians Sting and Deborah Harry for the challenge through a video. The challenge urges participants to use only $29 for all the food a person eats for seven days. "For one week, walk in someone else's shoes," Batali is quoted saying on the Food Bank for New York City's website. "By truly understanding what our friends and neighbors are going through, we will be better equipped to find solutions." The #FoodBankNYCChallenge is an attempt to live on a food stamp budget for one week, which translates to $1.38 per meal, according to the site. The effort is in response to recent cuts to food stamps. "Congress cut food stamps twice since 2013, and soup kitchens and food pantries saw an immediate increase in visitors," the site explains. Organizers hope the challenge will raise public awareness of the struggles for families to afford food while on food stamps.

Article: At 11:20pm, former world champion Ken Doherty potted a final black and extinguished, for now, the dream of Reanne Evans to become the first women player to play the hallowed baize of Sheffield's Crucible Theatre in the world snooker championship. In every other respect however, 29-year-old Evans, a single mum from Dudley, was a winner on Thursday night. She advanced the cause of women in sport no end and gave Doherty the fright of his life in an enthralling and attritional match that won't be bettered in this year's qualifying tournament. Snooker's governing body had been criticised in some quarters for allowing Evans a wild card to compete alongside 127 male players for the right to play in the sport's blue-chip event on April 18 - something no female had achieved. Reanne Evans shakes hands with Ken Doherty following his 10-8 victory at Ponds Forge. Evans plays a shot during her world championship qualifying match against Doherty. Doherty, who won the World Championship title back in 1997, took out the first frame 71-15. Evans had Doherty in all sorts of trouble before the former champion closed out the game 10-8. Those critics and the bookies who made Doherty a ridiculously short-priced 20/1 on favourite were made to look foolish as Evans had her illustrious opponent on the ropes before finally bowing out 10-8. A gracious Doherty admitted afterwards: 'She played out of her skin. It was good match play snooker and tough all the way through. There was a lot of pressure on this match, a different kind of pressure to what I've ever experienced. 'I don't usually feel sympathy for my opponents but I felt sorry at the end. She played better than me and lost. I don't know how I won that final frame. If it had gone to 9-9, I'd have been a million-to-one to win it.' Evans, cheered on by her eight-year-old daughter Lauren at the Ponds Forge sports centre in Sheffield, admitted she was exhausted after a match of unfamiliar intensity for her. A 10-time ladies' champion, Evans had led twice during the opening session before Doherty went 5-4 in front. The 10-time ladies world champion collected just £400 as prize money for winning the title in 2013, and this was a completely different environment against a player who beat Stephen Hendry to be crowned the best player in the world in 1997. 'It was a struggle. With the experience Ken had, I just had to dig in,' she said. 'Ken had little runs when he needed it but I could tell he was under pressure. Some of the balls were wobbling in from the first frame. I just couldn't take advantage in the end. 'I can play better than I did so there is no reason I can't return and beat Ken or even players above him. I have the women's game on my shoulders. I just hope I get some help and am allowed to play in more big tournaments to give me experience. 'Next week, I will playing the ladies in the club again. It's a lovely club don't get me wrong but I don't think many ladies could give Ken a game. I think I would have won if I'd taken it to 9-9.' The presence of television crews and snooker star Ronnie O'Sullivan underlined what a big story Evans' participation was. Evans eyes up her move during an enthralling game with Doherty in Sheffield. She lost the first frame convincingly but the nerves didn't show after that. She reeled off three frames in a row, led 4-3 and once Doherty went in front, pegged him back to 5-5 and 6-6. The Irishman, now ranked No 46 in the world, started to look his 45 years. He sat down at every opportunity while Evans often stood while he played. She had the confidence to play right-handed or left-handed, as O'Sullivan sometimes does. The key frame was the sixteenth. It lasted 45 minutes with Evans rattling off the first 59 points and Doherty the next 74. It took Doherty to a 9-7 lead but Evans came roaring back in the next frame. He needed a snooker to avoid the match going into a final frame – and he got it. Doherty, now ranked No 46 in the world, showed his experience to close out the contest. He has two more qualifying rounds before he makes the Crucible but it's doubtful he will face a tougher opponent. 'They should let her play in more competitions,' he added. Evans should certainly use this match to become a leading ambassador for women's sport. Her purple and silver waistcoats drew admiring glances from the swimmers and trampolinists who turned up at the leisure centre as normal as she walked through reception to the basketball hall, where 10 snooker tables had been set up. Next time they will know exactly who she is, and what she can do.

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence.
Reanne Evans faced Ken Doherty in World Championship qualifier. Doherty won the world championship in 1997. Evans lost the first frame 71-15 against Doherty. But the Dudley native fought back to lead 4-3. Ken Doherty, however, managed to close out an enthralling contest 10-8.

Article: Lagos, Nigeria (CNN)A day after winning Nigeria's presidency, Muhammadu Buhari told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that he plans to aggressively fight corruption that has long plagued Nigeria and go after the root of the nation's unrest. Buhari said he'll "rapidly give attention" to curbing violence in the northeast part of Nigeria, where the terrorist group Boko Haram operates. By cooperating with neighboring nations Chad, Cameroon and Niger, he said his administration is confident it will be able to thwart criminals and others contributing to Nigeria's instability. For the first time in Nigeria's history, the opposition defeated the ruling party in democratic elections. Buhari defeated incumbent Goodluck Jonathan by about 2 million votes, according to Nigeria's Independent National Electoral Commission. The win comes after a long history of military rule, coups and botched attempts at democracy in Africa's most populous nation. In an exclusive live interview from Abuja, Buhari told Amanpour he was not concerned about reconciling the nation after a divisive campaign. He said now that he has been elected he will turn his focus to Boko Haram and "plug holes" in the "corruption infrastructure" in the country. "A new day and a new Nigeria are upon us," Buhari said after his win Tuesday. "The victory is yours, and the glory is that of our nation." Earlier, Jonathan phoned Buhari to concede defeat. The outgoing president also offered a written statement to his nation. "I thank all Nigerians once again for the great opportunity I was given to lead this country, and assure you that I will continue to do my best at the helm of national affairs until the end of my tenure," Jonathan said. "I promised the country free and fair elections. I have kept my word." Buhari, 72, will be sworn in on May 29. He will take the helm at a critical time, as Nigeria grapples with Boko Haram, serious economic woes and corruption. This isn't Buhari's first time leading Nigeria, but it's his first time in nearly 30 years. A military coup brought Buhari to power in late 1983, closing a brief period of popular rule by Shehu Shagari. But Buhari himself was ousted by another military coup in August 1985. Read more: Who is Nigeria's Muhammadu Buhari? His presidential win is the result of his fourth attempt to lead the country since he was ousted 30 years ago. Buhari is a Sunni Muslim from Nigeria's poorer North, while Jonathan comes from a Christian and animist South that is rich with oil. Buhari praised voters for exercising their right peacefully. "Your vote affirms that you believe Nigeria's future can be better than what it is today," he said in his statement. "You voted for change, and now change has come." Buhari campaigned as a born-again democrat to allay fears about his strict military regime. He stressed that Nigeria's security needs to be the next government's focus. His campaign was also fiercely anti-corruption. He ran under the slogan of "new broom," and his supporters were often pictured holding brooms in the lead-up to the vote. Despite years of democracy, analysts say, corruption has hindered Nigeria from building a stable economy. One of Buhari's biggest challenges will be Boko Haram, which has been terrorizing Nigeria as it tries to institute a strict version of Sharia law in the country. In the past few years, the terror group has bombed churches and mosques, killed hundreds of people and kidnapped more than 200 teenage girls from a boarding school. Even the presidential vote had to be postponed because of the radical militants. The election was originally scheduled for February 14, but was delayed six weeks because the military needed more time to secure areas controlled by Boko Haram. Yet the violence persisted. On Saturday, residents in the northeastern state of Gombe said at least 11 people were killed in attacks at polling stations, apparently by Boko Haram extremists. Jonathan had been criticized for not doing enough to combat Boko Haram. Before the election, African affairs analyst Ayo Johnson said the vote would come down to who could make Nigeria feel safe. "Many Nigerians will not forget (Buhari) was a military leader during a dictatorship," Johnson said. "Or maybe they will feel that they need a military leader to address fundamental problems such as terrorism." Boko Haram isn't the only obstacle facing the new president. The economy is another major issue. Nigeria overtook South Africa last year as the region's largest economy. Nigeria is one of Africa's largest oil producers and is a major supplier of crude oil to the United States. It also hosts many international oil companies and workers. But many complain that the country's vast wealth from oil exports doesn't trickle down to the average citizen. As many as 70% of Nigerians live below the poverty line, surviving on less than a dollar a day. Christian Purefoy reported from Lagos; Holly Yan reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Stephanie Busari, Faith Karimi and Susannah Cullinane contributed to this report.

Article: If there’s one thing that stops a boiled egg from being the perfect food - it's the hassle of peeling it. More often than not the process will leave you with fragments of shell in your fingers, on the kitchen counter and sometimes even in your food. But one canny YouTube user, MicahMedia, has uploaded a video demonstrating the simplest and swiftest way to peel a hardboiled egg - using a glass of water. Scroll down for video. The hard-boiled egg is placed in a glass (left) before it is filled quarter of the way with tap water (right) He pops the hardboiled egg into a small tumbler glass before filling it a quarter of the way with water. He then places his hand over the top of the glass, completely covering it. His next move is to vigorously shake the glass from left to right. He keeps the glass in the sink so that the water doesn’t spill. After approximately ten seconds of shaking, the YouTuber lifts his hand to show the egg, which now has a cracked shell. He simply puts his hand in the glass and in a matter of miliseconds, lifts up the shell of the egg which has been loosened from the egg. The 28-second video which was uploaded in January this year currently has over 16million views on the video-sharing website. The egg is vigorously shaken from left to right so that the shell loosens. Result! Once the water has splashed out of the glass, simply peel lift the shell from the egg with no hassle. YouTube users have been praising MicahMedia for his ingenious solution to the age-old problem. ‘Well this has changed my morning. Good job, thanks,’ wrote Nikki Madison. Susan Wheeler wrote: ‘I have tried just about every method I have come across and been disappointed on the most part. This actually works wonderfully. I love doing it. Thanks!’ MicahMedia posted that he’s thinking of ‘doing six boiled eggs at once and seeing what happens.’

Article: West of Baghdad, Iraq (CNN)The call from Faleh Essawi, the deputy chief of the provincial council, who we were supposed to be meeting up with, came just as we were about to hit the bridge -- the only safe route from Baghdad to neighboring Anbar province. "ISIS has taken the east of the city, it's not accessible," he says, sounding frantic, rapidly rattling off the neighborhoods and areas ISIS fighters had just stormed into. Moments later, we see the impact: An endless stream of humanity, shell shocked, and exhausted. Parents cradle babies in blankets, some struggle under the weight of their belongings, some carry small plastic bags, while others nothing but the children clutching at their hands. Cars are not permitted to cross this bridge across the Euphrates. The government feels that restricting vehicles will decrease the likelihood of explosives making their way into Iraq's capital. Those too young or too tired to walk pile into metal carts pushed by boys or young men, normally used to carry produce to markets. An elderly woman sits in one, a child in her arms, a worn down plastic doll in her hand. Many don't want to talk, at least not for long. What they just went through is too raw, too painful. One man we encounter describes how ISIS fighters commandeered his house. "We heard clashes in the early morning, and we couldn't see the security forces anywhere," he recalls. "We saw the ISIS fighters, they just came into the house, they didn't say a word. They just sent a sniper to the roof.  I grabbed my children and ran." His wife bursts into tears, prompting him to apologize for not being able to talk anymore -- they just want to keep going. Another older woman, sitting in one of the carts surrounded by her grandchildren, starts sobbing the moment we approach her. "They took our homes and kicked us out," she cries. Over the weekend ISIS moved into towns just to the north of Ramadi, which lies 68 miles (110km) west of Baghdad, sending thousands fleeing on foot into the city.  ISIS had already blocked off access from the south months ago, and the west was contested territory.  The east, until now, was not just a relatively safe zone but the only viable entrance and exit. At a hospital in Amriyat al-Falluja, about a 15-minute drive away, a wounded local fighter winces in pain. He was shot by a sniper in Ramadi that morning as ISIS fighters advanced -- the bullet barely missed his heart. "We had been warning we could see their movements," he tells us. "But we just didn't have the force to hold them off.  We didn't leave a single person we didn't call and ask for back up." But none came. Hours after our morning conversation we speak to Essawi again by phone. "Security is collapsing in the city," he screams. "This is what we warned Baghdad would happen. Where is Baghdad? Where is al-Abadi? "Just God knows if we will survive this," he says and hangs up. Amriyat al-Falluja regularly comes under attack from rockets and mortars from ISIS positions nearby. The hospital's façade is scarred by shrapnel. The wards are full of people injured during these attacks. Fifteen-year-old Mustafa Ahmed has bandages on his neck, leg, and other parts of his body. "A mortar fell on our street, one of my neighbors was wounded," he explains. "We went out to help him and the second one fell on us." His friend died, he says. In the next room Amal Ahmed speaks softly. "I was in the garden and a rocket hit and the shrapnel sliced me open," she says, as tears roll down her face. "Something fell out of me and I grabbed it and I put it back in and I lay down." She starts to cry harder. Her husband was killed by U.S. forces in Fallujah -- another city in Anbar -- in 2003.  Her children have all moved away except her youngest, who broke his arm in the same attack. "When I see the situation I don't have hope, it's just getting worse." A few moments later, we hear two massive explosions from another of the hospital's buildings. They think it's an ISIS rocket or mortar attack so we take cover along with the Iraqi forces we are with in the hallway, away from the windows. More explosions go off in the distance. Then another actually shakes our building. "Anyone want tea?" one of the policemen with us asks, laughing as he pours.  "This happens all the time, we're used to it." The police chief, Major Aref al-Janabi, radios to his men to respond.  Al-Janabi, like so many others, is frustrated with the lack of support from Baghdad.  Earlier, he had taken us to the front lines, a long berm that stretches along the northern and western parts of the town that is dotted with fighting positions.  He says he regularly provides the joint command center with coordinates for ISIS positions, but so far there have been no significant air strikes or reinforcements. More explosions follow in the distance. We're quickly moved out and leave the town, heading back towards the bridge and the long, snaking lines of refugees. An ambulance passes us, trying to force its way through the crowds.  The swell of people fleeing has grown considerably in the last hours -- not surprising given Essawi's dire assessment and warning. "Ramadi is under siege from all sides," he'd told us earlier, anger mixed with an air of resignation. "I consider the city to have fallen." He claimed that 150,000 have fled, scoffing at statements from Iraqi officials in Baghdad that reinforcements have been sent to Ramadi.  He has yet to see them.

Article: Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers believes recent defeats are down to his players' own failings rather than the opposition having cracked their system. The Reds' 3-4-2-1 formation, implemented from mid-December, helped produce a 13-match unbeaten Barclays Premier League run which lifted them to within a win of breaking back into the Champions League qualification places. But despite receiving plaudits for the quality of their football, which at times appeared to be unplayable, flaws started to appear a month ago when they were held to a goalless draw by Sky Bet Championship side Blackburn in the FA Cup. Brendan Rodgers says his sides recent defeats are down to his players, not his tactics being susses. After scraping a win against Swansea they were then exposed by Manchester United and Arsenal, two teams already in the top four. However, Rodgers insists a drop-off in results is more to do with their own performances than those of their opponents. 'I don't think it's about being worked out. We didn't start well (against Arsenal), and it doesn't matter what system you are playing if that happens,' he said. 'In the last four games that we've played we haven't created as much, and that's more on ourselves. Liverpool have lost ground in the race for the Champions League places and will find it hard to recover. 'Of course you give opponents credit but every team will go into a game to defend well and work hard against you. 'Probably the Blackburn game when we drew 0-0 and the games following that we haven't created as much. 'That's something that we want to reinforce - the creativity for chances and hopefully taking those chances. 'It's a difficult system to play against, but it's one of a number of systems we've played here and played very well. Alexis Sanchez fires home Arsenal's third goal, as the Gunners thrashed Liverpool at the Emirates. 'It's my job to always look to find the solutions, that's what I've tried to do in the games when we didn't look like scoring, finding a way to win.' Blackburn, who host Liverpool in their FA Cup quarter-final replay on Wednesday, will take heart from the Merseysiders' mini-slump at a crucial time of the season. For Rodgers and Liverpool though the cup now represents the only chance to save their season and that should guarantee a reaction at Ewood Park. 'It's important to have a game quickly when you lose,' added Rodgers. 'The group is very committed to winning this trophy but in order to do that you have to qualify and we know Blackburn will be a difficult game for us. Steven Gerrard (left) and Mario Balotelli look on as Rodgers give a talk to his players and staff. 'A trophy this season will mark another step forward for us. Getting to a final and winning a trophy is what we want. 'In terms of the FA Cup that was always an objective. 'On Wednesday, we'll look to reach our second semi-final of the season in the cup competitions (having been narrowly beaten by Chelsea over two legs).' With the play-offs out of reach for Rovers they will also be putting all their efforts into trying to reach a Wembley last-four encounter with Aston Villa. Jordan Rhodes (centre) can cause Liverpool's leaky defence a number of problems in the FA Cup replay. They showed enough on Merseyside a month ago to suggest they can trouble the Reds and, having dispatched top-flight sides Swansea and Stoke at Ewood Park, they will have no fear of Liverpool's arrival. 'Blackburn have got some excellent players. They defended well when they came to Anfield,' said Rodgers. 'We'll go there really focused and determined - we can't wait to play again after the weekend's disappointment.'

Article: Obock, Djibouti (CNN)Amina Ali Qassim is sitting with her youngest grandchild on her lap, wiping away tears with her headscarf. Only a few months old, this is the baby girl whose ears she desperately tried to cover the night the aerial bombardment started. She lay awake, she says, in a village mosque on the Yemeni island of Birim, counting explosions as the baby cried. It could have been worse though. They could have still been in their house when the first missile landed. "Our neighbor shouted to my husband 'you have to leave, they're coming.' And we just ran. As soon as we left the house, the first missile fell right by it and then a second on it. It burned everything to the ground," Qassim tells us. Qassim and her family fled Birim at first light, piling in with three other families. Twenty-five of them squeezed into one boat setting sail through the Bab al-Mandab Strait to Djibouti. Bab al-Mandab is one of the busiest waterways in the world, a thoroughfare for oil tankers and cargo ships. It's now being crossed by desperate Yemenis in rickety fishing boats seeking refuge from the conflict threatening to engulf their country. Qassim's son Mohamed describes the families' journey across this part of the Red Sea as "a window into hell." "The women were violently ill," he tells us. "It was a catastrophe." It took them five hours to cross into the north of Djibouti, where the government is providing the refugees with temporary shelter in this unfinished orphanage here in Obock. And the U.N. says thousands more refugees are expected. Qassim and her family will soon have to move to the plastic tents that have been prepared for them on the dusty outskirts of the town, taking with them only the collection of plastic mats and pots neatly stacked in the corner. It's all that remains of everything they once owned. Her two daughters are trapped back in Yemen, in Taiz. She hasn't been able to reach them and the worry she says is almost unbearable. I ask her how many days it was after the Saudi aerial bombardment began that they left. She looks at me and laughs, "How many days would you have stayed?" Then she goes quiet, looking down at the granddaughter in her lap. Finally she tells me, "I thought she would never be able to stop screaming. That the fear would stay with her forever." "May God please have mercy on Yemen."

Article: The brother of Boney M's lead singer Liz Mitchell has been arrested in connection with the killing of a Syrian-born imam. Burnell 'Bernie' Mitchell - who changed his name to Khalid Rashad after converting to Islam - has been held on suspicion of conspiracy to murder after the death of Abdul Hadi Arwani, a Syrian national. The 61-year-old has also been arrested on suspicion of preparing and instigating acts of terrorism as Scotland Yard detectives  continue to investigate Mr Arwani's shooting. A 36-year-old man has been charged with his shooting while a woman, aged 53, was arrested this in Brent on suspicion of terrorism offences. Burnell 'Bernie' Mitchell - also known as Khalid Rashad - (left) has been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder and terrorism offences. His sister is Liz Mitchell (right),  lead singer of the 1970s band Boney M. Syrian-born 48-year-old Abdul Hadi Arwani (pictured) was found dead in his car on Tuesday. One man has been charged with his murder while Mitchell is held on suspicion of conspiracy to murder. Mr Mitchell, who founded An Noor Mosque in Acton where Mr Arwani was a preacher until 2011, was arrested on Wednesday night on suspicion of conspiracy to murder. On Thursday afternoon Scotland Yard revealed they had further arrested the Jamaican national on suspicion of terrorism offences. His sister is the singer Liz Mitchell who fronted the 1970s band Boney M and whose hits include Rasputin and Daddy Cool. A spokesman for the singer declined to comment today. The siblings were raised in Britain as strict Christians, having fled the Caribbean as children. Last night Mr Mitchell's home was searched at the same time as An-Noor Mosque which he founded more than 20 years ago because 'he and his Muslim friends had nowhere to go'. They are investigating the death of Mr Arwani, a 48-year-old Syrian national who was found killed in his car last week. Search: Police visited the Wembley home of Burnell Mitchell, a director of the mosque where Mr Arwani used to preach regularly. Leslie Cooper, left, has appeared in court charged with murdering iman Abdul Hadi Arwani, right. The 61-year-old is a businessman from Jamaica. Within days of Mr Arwani's body being found last week, Metropolitan Police drafted in the help of Counter Terrorism officers 'because of their expertise in the management of investigations with international dimensions and an established liaison network abroad'. Today a spokesman confirmed searches were ongoing at the An Noor mosque. 'Officers are fully aware of the sensitivities of conducting this search at this time and would like to thank the local Muslim community for their support and patience thus far in the necessary investigations that have occurred to date,' a Scotland Yard spokesman said. 'This remains a murder investigation and a search for the truth; it is therefore vital that the investigation is thorough which includes a detailed searches of premises.' Today the Old Bailey heard how Mr Arwani  he was killed  after being lured to north London to meet a potential client for his building company. It was then the 48-year-old was murdered by 36-year-old Leslie Cooper, a prosecutor told a judge during a pre-trial hearing. The Jamaican businessman, who was arrested while his family enjoyed a barbecue, did not enter a plea, appearing via video link from prison. ‘A member of the public noticed he had collapsed at the wheel and the car was running that morning’, prosecutor Oliver Glasgow said. Mr Arwani was described as 'the most peaceful man you could wish to meet' by his family last week. Police pictured outside the An Noor mosque in north west London while searching the premises. Mitchell was listed as a director of the mosque where Mr Arwani used to preach. Mr Arwani was found dead last week in this Volkswagen Passat on a street in Wembley. Police believed he visited the scene in the days before his death. ‘Concerned for his health, they contact police and paramedics who discovered Mr Arwani had been shot five times and was already dead.’ Mr Glasgow said Mr Arwani and his son, who was also part of the building firm, had met a man called ‘John’ two days earlier over a possible renovation job. ‘They collected the individual on April 5 and were taken to the property in Wembley but he explain they couldn’t get access to the premises because his wife was not there’, he said. ‘Arrangements were made to come back and view the property some days later..’ Hassan Anyabwile (pictured last week) was brought in to replace Mr Arwani at An Noor Mosque. Mr Arwani rearranged the viewing for April 7, said Mr Glasgow, and was last seen alive leaving his family home at 9.30am to go to meet the man called John. ‘There was no further contact with the deceased and his family’, he added. Cooper did not speak during the hearing other than to confirm his name. He has not yet entered a plea to one charge of murder. He is one of three people to have been arrested in connection with Mr Arwani’s death. Alongside Mr Mitchell is a 53-year-old woman arrested on Thursday morning on suspicion of terrorism offences. Mr Arwani was a preacher at An Noor mosque in Acton until 2011 when he left under reportedly frayed tensions. The father of six was described by relatives as 'the most peaceful man you could wish to meet' upon the news of his death last week. One of his sons said he 'actively' fought extremism while friends added he was a vocal critic of the President Assad's government. He is thought to have fled Syria as a teenager after being told he would face violence to photographing damage in his home city of Hama. Speaking after his father's murder, Murhaf Arwani said: 'He just loved to help people. He did not care what your background, race or status was. 'He did not care if you were rich or poor. He just wanted to help people in need. 'He spoke up and out against the crime of terror and oppression wherever he found it. He was an advocate of peace for all and he showed us this in the way he lived his life from day to day.' Last week the Caribbean preacher who replaced Mr Arwani at An Noor Mosque denied claims the 48-year-old had left under strained relationships. Hassan Anyabwile, who was involved in an attempted coup d'etat in his native Trinidad and Tobago 25 years ago with the Muslim group Jamaat al Muslimeem, told MailOnline he knew nothing of a reported dispute between Mr Arwani and the mosque. Asked about the 48-year-old's death he said: 'All I can say is from Allah we come, and to Allah we return.' He was assisted into the mosque - which currently remains closed as officers search its premises - by a bodyguard after becoming partially disabled.

Article: (CNN)The Coxes can rest more comfortably living in Georgia now that their 5-year-old daughter can get the marijuana extract she needs. "This means the world to us," said Haleigh Cox's mother, Janea Cox. Gov. Nathan Deal signed a bill Thursday that will legalize low-THC cannabis oil for certain "medication-resistant epilepsies," while creating an infrastructure, registration process and research program for the drug. (THC is the primary psychoactive substance in marijuana.) The bill is dubbed Haleigh's Hope Act. Haleigh, who has been the face of the bill, was having hundreds of seizures a day and the five potent drugs meant to control them weren't making life better for the little girl. Janea Cox said in a March 2014 interview that she made the difficult decision to move her daughter to Colorado, where medical marijuana is legal, in hopes of saving her life. "She was maxed out," Cox said. "She'd quit breathing several times a day, and the doctors blamed it on the seizure medications." 10 diseases marijuana could affect. Cox had heard that a form of medical marijuana might help, but it wasn't available in Georgia. So a week after hearing a doctor's diagnosis that Haleigh might not live another three months, she and Haleigh packed up and moved to Colorado Springs, Colorado. There, Haleigh began a regimen of cannabis oil: four times a day and once at night. "Every time she smiled I knew we did the right thing, because we hadn't seen her smile in three years," Cox said. "Now she's thriving, she's healthy, she's happy, and they're absolutely shocked at the difference. So I think we've turned some nonbelievers into believers of cannabis oil." Deal is apparently one of those believers, signing HB1 on Thursday and opening the door for the use of cannabis oil to treat certain medical conditions. The bill will benefit not only people who suffer from chronic seizure disorders, but it also will allow patients to receive in-state treatment. To obtain a license in Georgia, you will need to have a specific covered condition, such as acute seizures. "For the families enduring separation and patients suffering pain, the wait is finally over," Deal said Thursday. "... Now, Georgia children and their families may return home while continuing to receive much-needed care." For Cox, it's a blessing "to be able to come back home, and with Haleigh's medicine, it's done wonders for her -- going from 200-plus seizures a day and on her deathbed to a smiling, happy girl who says words now and looks us in the eye and lets us know she's in there." She added, "Colorado has been good to us, but Georgia's home. Georgia's definitely home." With medical marijuana legal in nearly half the states, doctors are increasingly studying what effect the drug has on various ailments. While Georgia's law is specific to a handful of conditions, medical marijuana laws in states such as California permit marijuana use for an array of ailments. But as states rewrite their regulations, federal law remains the same: Marijuana is illegal to grow, sell or use for any purpose. Under the Controlled Substances Act, marijuana is listed on Schedule 1, meaning it has "no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse." To backers of reform, it presents a Catch-22: Marijuana is restricted, in large part, because there is scant research to support medical uses, yet research is difficult to conduct because of tight restrictions.

Article: (CNN)The Cuba that photographer Carolina Sandretto captures is a world away from the images of neon 1950s American cars and postcard-worthy white sand beaches that most visitors to the island bring back home. Instead Sandretto focuses on "solares," the crumbling buildings that many Cubans divide and cohabitate, often with several generations and separate families sharing one dwelling. "This situation of bringing into your house your husband or your wife and living with your own parents in your late 30s and 40s, I always thought is really interesting and different than the U.S. but similar to my country since that's the way it was 50 years ago," said Sandretto, who is from Italy. Following Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution, houses and apartments were redistributed throughout Cuba and the government promised that everyone would have a home in the new socialist utopia. But building did not keep pace with the population, and Cubans were forced to adapt by dividing and re-dividing up homes to make room. "It ends up to be a very interesting habitat," Sandretto said. "Because there (are) so many different layers of people. It creates a whole community, even if neighbors really don't like each other." Sandretto said she first visited Cuba three years ago and was instantly hooked. "I stayed and went back and back because it's a very unique place and people are really beautiful and amazing and with interesting stories," she said. Gaining entrance to the maze-like solares was a constant negotiation, Sandretto said, and plenty of times she was turned away. "I always try to explain what I do, why I am there, why I am interested in where they live, the aim of my project," she said. Toting a 30-year-old Hasselblad 500cm camera, Sandretto found it was a good way to strike up a conversation with her subjects. Social media. Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. "They get curious when see someone going around with a bulky old camera," she said. "I talk a lot. I am Italian. I speak Spanish, which helps but not a lot because you have to speak 'Cuban,' which is another language." Her persistence allowed her to capture intimate moments of Cubans resting in the sweltering heat, crowding around a communal TV or just going about life despite their disintegrating surroundings. There are no modern appliances or conveniences in her photographs. The people in these solares aren't the fortunate Cubans who have relatives visiting from Miami with flat-screens and smartphones in tow. Instead, there is the sense of time being whittled away -- one game of dominoes or one TV soap opera a time. Sandretto said she hopes to continue to document the changes on the island that occur as the United States and Cuba work to restore diplomatic relations and an inevitable influx of American visitors arrive. The thawing in relations could even change life in Cuba's solares. "People want to travel, have access to the Internet and improve their economic situation," she said. "I hope that's what happens."

Article: (CNN)The White House insists it doesn't need congressional approval for the Iran nuclear deal announced this month. But while historical precedent suggests the President might indeed have the authority to move forward without Congress, the Obama administration should probably learn another lesson from history: Getting Congress' signature might be worth the effort. True, the fight for congressional approval would be politically bruising and consume a huge amount of energy. But it would still be a mistake to move forward with the deal as an executive-based agreement rather than obtaining the consent of the legislative branch -- a diplomatic breakthrough of this magnitude would be far more enduring with the imprimatur of Congress. The President and his advisers have avoided using the term "treaty," instead explaining that it would be a "nonbinding agreement." According to Secretary of State John Kerry: "We've been very clear from the beginning. We're not negotiating a 'legally binding plan.' We're negotiating a plan that will have in it a capacity for enforcement." On "Meet the Press," Kerry said, "What we're looking for is not to have Congress interfere with our ability, inappropriately, by stepping on the prerogatives of the executive department of the President." There is a big legal argument that will play out over these definitional issues, with the potential for court challenges. But outside of the legal debate, there are also significant political questions, and those are a different beast altogether. For a start, there is growing pressure on Capitol Hill -- from members of both parties -- to pass legislation that would give Congress the right to review the deal and make a decision about lifting sanctions. On Tuesday, a deal was reached on legislation proposed by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker that would require President Barack Obama to submit the final deal to Congress, giving it 52 days to review and approve the agreement. Corker told MSNBC on Tuesday that negotiators had reached a "bipartisan agreement that keeps the congressional review process absolutely intact, full of integrity." What's in the Iran bill and why all the fuss? There is good reason for Obama to avoid calling this a treaty. After all, given the contentious political environment on Capitol Hill, where legislators struggle to pass even a routine budget, the notion that they would move on a treaty of this importance seems dubious at best. But there is also a history of Congress causing significant trouble for important international treaties. In the late 1970s, for example, President Jimmy Carter tried to obtain consent for the SALT II treaties, but conservatives argued the agreement was evidence that Carter was weak on defense. Carter pushed for the treaties as essential to international peace but to no avail. After Iranians took American hostages and the Soviets invaded Afghanistan, the treaties died in the Senate. Yet there are other examples where even in a contentious congressional environment, presidents successfully pushed for the ratification of treaties that they knew would cost them important political  capital, and even once the White House exited the struggle bruised and battered, the historic treaties endured. Top GOP, Dem senators say Iran compromise reached. This was the case with another treaty that Carter asked the Senate to ratify: the Panama Canal Treaties of 1978. Carter decided that turning authority of the canal over to Panama was essential to regional peace and stability. He knew this would be tough sell, and Tennessee Republican Howard Baker for his part predicted he wouldn't even get 20 votes as conservative groups coordinated their campaign through the Committee to Save the Panama Canal and the Emergency Coalition to Save the Panama Canal. Indeed, they dispatched speakers to warn that the deal would give the Soviets a foothold in the region. However, Carter countered aggressively, both on a personal level -- helping secure the vote of Sen. Richard Stone of Florida by sending a personal letter to the senator, dispatching experts to Florida to answer the questions of constituents and addressing audiences through state-of-the-art telephone hookups. In the end, the Senate ratified the treaties by one vote more than the required two-thirds majority, although Carter also paid a political price after energizing the right during the fight. President Ronald Reagan faced a similar challenge. Toward the end of his presidency, he reached a historic breakthrough on intercontinental ballistic missiles with the Soviet Union. Yet despite excitement in the White House and across the nation about Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's visit to Washington in December 1987, many conservatives blasted the decision, arguing that Reagan had betrayed the conservative cause. During a meeting at the White House, eight Republican senators who opposed the treaty shared their feelings with Reagan. Sen. Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming, one of Reagan's closest allies, said: "The Soviets have broken most every treaty they have ever signed.... How do we assure compliance with the new treaty?" Right-wing organizations, meanwhile, compared Reagan with Neville Chamberlain. Reagan responded with an aggressive effort to halt their rebellion. In a hearing on the treaty, Secretary of State George Shultz attacked North Carolina Republican Jesse Helms, who had accused Reagan of "confusion, misstatements and... even misrepresentation." He met with Republicans, spoke with reporters and lobbied the public to endorse the deal. Despite their protests, most Republicans eventually came around. On May 27, 1988, the Senate ratified the treaty 93-5. Helms, one of the few to vote against the treaty, admitted they were "licked." And the treaty, which marked the beginning of the end for the Cold War, has endured. The reality is that the signature of Congress is still worth a lot in American politics -- the ratification process brings legitimacy to a major and controversial agreement and makes it much more difficult for opponents to attack in the future as some power grab by a president. Congressional support also makes the strength of the treaty greater in the eyes of leaders overseas. All this will be true with Iran, especially as many members of Obama's own party are leery about the agreement. Ultimately, the President probably has the right to go his own way with this, and his frustration with Congress might create strong incentives for doing so. But in the long term, persuading and pressuring a sufficient number of legislators to sign on to this deal would greatly improve the chances of avoiding a regional war -- and would help prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear power. The good news is that there have been some statements from the White House that offer hope it recognizes the centrality of Congress in a solid deal. Now it's time to see if the administration follows through.

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence. The White House is pushing for an Iran nuclear deal without congressional approval, but historical precedent suggests that obtaining Congress' signature would make the deal more enduring and legitimate, despite the political

Article: A youngster admiring his catch was left surprised when the fish jumped up and slapped him in the face. Quinn Patrick was on a fishing trip with his dad at Snow Lake, Indiana when the pair caught a bowfin, videoed lying lifeless on a concrete dock. Crouching over the fish, Quinn deliberates whether someone should put it back in the water. When suddenly the Bowfin propels itself from the ground and slaps the youngster straight in the face with its large tail. The sound of the fish making impact with the youngster’s face is not dissimilar to a sound effect used in a cartoon. Recoiling, Quinn stumbles backwards in shock as his dad begins laughing – prompting the youngster to laugh along with him. Quinn Patrick was on a fishing trip with his dad at Snow Lake, Indiana when the pair caught a Bowfin. The young boy then states: ‘Dad there’s blood on him,’ and his father replies by gently explaining that the fish got hurt. Worried, the youngster replies rather sweetly: ‘By me?’ Before his dad reassures him that he is not to blame. The video concludes with the father discussing the size of the Bowfin’s teeth. The Bowfin propels itself from the ground and slaps the youngster straight in the face with its large tail. Bowfin are native to North America and are commonly found in east America, south Ontario and Quebec. They are demersal freshwater fish, which means they live and feed at the bottom of lakes and seas. And are piscivore, which means they are carnivorous and predominately eat other fish. Common names for the fish include mudfish, dogfish, mud pike, griddle, grinnel, cypress trout and choupique. The sound of the fish making impact with the youngster’s face is not dissimilar to a sound effect used in a cartoon.

Article: (CNN)Lady Antebellum singer Hillary Scott's tour bus caught fire on a Texas freeway Thursday morning, but everyone on board was safely evacuated. Michael Barnett captured dramatic video of the fire, on Interstate 30 just northeast of Dallas, and uploaded it to CNN iReport. Smoke and flames poured from the rear of the bus as traffic slowed to a crawl and Barnett slowly approached in his vehicle. As he drew closer to the bus, Barnett decided to stop filming because he didn't know what to expect. "It was shocking," he said. "I didn't know what I was about to see. I didn't know if anyone was hurt." Barnett said he didn't realize at the time that the bus belonged to the country band. Hillary Scott, co-lead singer for the band, posted a photo of the charred bus on Instagram and noted that she, her husband, the tour manager and the driver were all evacuated safely. "Thanking God for our safety and the safety of all of those who helped put this fire out and keep us safe," she wrote. The tour manager told CNN affiliate KTVT that the bus stopped after a rear tire blew out. It burst into flames after everyone had gotten off. Scott also posted an Instagram photo and message saying that the fire destroyed everything in the bus's back lounge except her Bible. The band's two other members, Charles Kelley and Dave Haywood, were not traveling on the bus, KTVT reported. Lady Antebellum is set to perform at the 50th Academy of Country Music Awards on Sunday in Arlington, Texas.

Article: Ian Bell rescued England from a nightmare start with a century in the first Test against West Indies that was pay back time for being dropped during his last Caribbean series. After his classy 143 had steered England to 341 for five, after they had been 34 for three, Bell said that thoughts of him losing his place in 2009 was a big motivating factor. Bell said: 'It's been at the back of my mind for some time that I got dropped the last time I was here for a Test series. So I wanted to make this one count and it was very satisfying to do so. I deserved to be dropped at the time and I did a lot of hard yards to get back in.' Ian Bell scored 143 on the first day of the first Test against West Indies in Antigua on Monday. The 33-year-old kisses the England badge on his helmet after his 22nd Test match century. And Bell rates his hundred one of the best of his 22 – only Alastair Cook (25), out for another low score, and Kevin Pietersen (23) have scored more. Bell shared century partnerships of 177 with Joe Root, who made 83 and another one of 130 with Ben Stokes who is 71 not out. 'It has to be right up there,' said Bell. It doesn't get much better. The partnership with Joe Root was just what we needed. But the West Indies bowled very well for the first two hours. And Ben Stokes made it a brilliant finish to the day.' Bell was dropped from the side on his last visit to the Caribbean in 2009. Bell put on 177 for the fourth wicket with Joe Root and added 130 for the fifth wicket with Ben Stokes.'It was my day today, but hopefully it will be someone else's day in the next innings. 'For me, it was nice - coming here in 2009, this was where I got dropped after our shemozzle in Jamaica, so I was determined to come out and play as well as I could. 'It was nice to come back and put things right.' Bell raises his bat after being dismissed for 143 in the evening session on day one in Antigua. Kemar Roach runs away to celebrate bowling Alastair Cook out for 11 on the first morning of the Test. Cook, who hasn't added to his record haul of 25 centuries since May 2013, was bowled by Kemar Roach for 11 falling again to a good length ball outside off stump. Roach said: 'Cook has a weakness there, everyone knows it. We let them get away a bit, but Bell batted very well.' The other two England disappointments were a nervous-looking Jonathan Trott who lasted just three deliveries on his return from'situational anxiety', and Gary Ballance, who also fell to a poor shot.

Article: Washington (CNN)In a broad bipartisan vote, the Senate on Tuesday gave final approval to a Medicare reform bill that includes a permanent solution to the "doc fix," a method the government has used to ensure payments to Medicare providers will keep up with inflation. The bill, which passed 92 to 8, also includes a two-year extension of a popular children's health insurance program. The issue of payments to Medicare providers has been a thorny issue for years.  Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch of Utah called passage of the bill a "major, major accomplishment." "Tonight, the Senate is voting to retire the outdated, inefficiency-rewarding, common sense-defying Medicare reimbursement system," said Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee just before the final vote. The House approved the same bill overwhelmingly more than two weeks ago and President Barack Obama is expected to sign it.  Senate passage came just hours before cuts to physicians would have taken place since the last temporary "doc fix" had already expired. Some conservative senators, including Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz of Texas, balked at the more than $200 billion price of the bill and pushed an amendment to have the costs offset. The bill, "institutionalizes and expands Obamacare policies that harm patients and their doctors while adding roughly half a trillion dollars to our long-term debt within two decades," Cruz said in a statement.  "Any deal should be fully paid for and include significant and structural reforms to Medicare." But that amendment was defeated, as were several others from each party that came up for votes. Earlier, House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio warned the Senate not to change the bill. "Unless the Senate passes the House-passed 'doc fix,' significant cuts to physicians' payments will begin tomorrow," Boehner said.  "We urge the Senate to approve the House-passed bill without delay." Cruz voted against the bill, as did Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, another Republican running for president. GOP presidential contender Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky voted for the bill.

Article: Given the inexorable march of the past 12 months in one direction, perhaps it is only appropriate that Rory McIlroy should spend the eve of the Masters on Wednesday with a member of the celebrated boy band of that name. But it is not lookalike Harry Styles who will carry the Northern Irishman's bag in the par-three tournament but keen golfer Niall Horan as McIlroy looks for a little light relief before his first attempt to complete a career Grand Slam. One Direction released their debut album in 2011, the same year McIlroy won his first major, so you could say they have mirrored each other, hit for greatest hit. Rory McIlroy watches a tee shot during a practice round prior to the start of the 2015 Masters Tournament. McIlroy alongside his caddie Caroline Wozniacki during the 2014 Par 3 Contest  in Augusta. McIlroy celebrates with his  Wozniacki on the 9th hole during  the Par 3 contest at Augusta National Golf Club. At last year's Masters, McIlroy piqued the interest of one or two photographers when then fiancee Caroline Wozniacki donned the caddie's famous white boiler suit. He might find the curiosity levels are even greater this time, for One Direction are even more popular in the US than in Britain. Between them, Niall, an honorary member at Mullingar, Westmeath, and Rory might do more to stir up interest in golf among the young than any number of 'old fogey' initiatives. 'We met in Australia at the end of last year and he was saying he had never been to The Masters,' said McIlroy. 'I said if you're available on the Wednesday you're more than welcome to carry the bag. Niall's really excited.' Niall Horan will swap girls screams for Augusta greens as he caddies for golfer McIlroy. McIlroy hits a putt in the rain during a practice round prior to the start of the 2015 Masters Tournament. McIlroy looked more subdued than excited at his press conference yesterday, possibly because he knew what was coming. On the one hand, he feels as ready as he ever will for his tilt at history. On the other, he had to spend 30 minutes with journalists wanting to trawl over his poor record at Augusta. Here is a sample: Why is your record so bad on the par fives, Rory? Why have you never birdied either the first or the 10th holes? Why have you left here for the past five years with at least one 77 on your score card? What the hell's wrong given all the advantages offered by your length off the tee? McIlroy  walks over the Nelson Bridge with caddie J.P. Fitzgerald during a practice round. To be fair, he answered them all with politeness. After all, there was nothing there he had not analysed and dissected countless times himself. McIlroy knows better than anyone he has no chance unless he does better on the long holes. He brought up the point raised in the Sportsmail graphic from last Saturday, which compared his record on the par fives last year with that of winner Bubba Watson. 'Just look at the two par fives on the back nine on Sunday,' he said. 'I had a nine iron in my hand for my second shot on both and I walked off with two sixes. Two fours I'd have finished third. McIlroy waits under an umbrella during a practice round prior to the start of the 2015 Masters Tournament. 'It's something I've been thinking about a lot. Look at Bubba, who played them in eight-under for the week to my level par and beat me by eight shots. 'I've just been too aggressive at times. I had four sixes on par-fives last year, so if I can clean up those, I'll have a chance to win.' As for those 77s, he said: 'It's not like I'm having a bad 18 holes. It's always just a bad nine holes that causes the damage and it's usually on a Friday, like last year. But I am better equipped now to handle it if things don't go right way. Mentally, I'm in a far better place.' McIlroy conceded that the circus surrounding Tiger Woods's return had not been unhelpful and the draw has worked out pretty well, too. The place you do not want to be come Thursday is in one of the last two groups, like Woods, but McIlroy has been treated kindly, with a mid-morning threesome alongside Americans Phil Mickelson and Ryan Moore. 'I don't think I've played alongside Phil at Augusta so that's perfect,' he said. 'We always get along well and he has a great record here. It will be fun to watch him.' It was this time last week, while practising in Florida, that McIlroy pronounced himself ready to go. 'It's been great not to have to think of anything technical while I'm playing,' he said. 'I've been able to enjoy the build-up.' Rory McIlroy waits with his caddie Fitzgerald in the rain during a practice round  at Augusta National Golf Club. Asked who he saw as favourite, McIlroy went for Bubba — ironic given a recent ESPN survey among the pros ranked Watson as the least favourite. 'I take it as I need to improve as a man,' said Watson, with the sort of annoying comment that explains his unpopularity in the first place. As for McIlroy, he knows where he needs to improve. 'You look at this course and it should fit me perfectly from tee to green,' he said. After One Direction on Wednesday, it'll be his turn to generate some roars.

Article: (CNN)Caught up in a rip current while snorkeling at Finn's Beach in Bali, Roxy Walsh was holding on to some rocks when she spotted something special. Engraved with the words, "Darling Joe, Happy 70th Birthday 2009. Love Jenny," the antique ring lodged in the rocks clearly meant something to both Joe and Jenny. But there were no other clues (besides the fact that the words were written in English) as to where the couple might live. When she returned home to Palm Beach, Australia, Walsh was determined to reunite the ring with its owner. She went to the 5,000 members of her company's Facebook page, Kids in Adelaide, to reunite Joe and Jenny with the ring. She also created a "Find Joe and Jenny" page to track them down. "Hi all. It's Roxy here. This is a reaaaallyy long shot but would love some SHARE love on this post to help find Joe. Found this gold ring snorkeling at Finns Beach in Bali today. It's got a family crest on it, and engraved with the message 'Darling Joe, Happy 70th Birthday 2009. Love Jenny' How amazing would it be to find him! Please click share." The post got shared all over the world. Nine months earlier, Joe Langley had been snorkeling in the same spot in Bali when he lost the ring, which his wife, Jenny, had purchased an antique store and had engraved for his birthday. "I went for a swim, got caught in a rip, decided the rip was going to take me and finished up on the rocks," Langley told Sunshine Coast Daily. "In clawing my way over the rocks, the ring pulled off my finger." The Langleys' 19-year-old granddaughter saw the Facebook post April 9 and made the connection. It turns out that the Langleys are fellow Australians, living in the town of Noosa, just three hours from where Walsh lives in Palm Beach. Walsh had the ring professionally cleaned before she met the happy Langleys in Noosa to return it.

Article: Meet Suma, one of Melbourne Zoo's aging orangutans who suffers from arthritis. She was first diagnosed with the condition in 2013 where she was initially given daily medication to help relieve the pain. But on Thursday, amazing photographs were captured of the primate's thorough health examination by surgeons. Although is not unusual for middle-aged orangutans to have arthritis, doctors had to anaesthetise Suma in order to check how her condition has progressed over the past two years. Suma was treated by orthopaedic surgeon and associate professor Marino Pirpiris, who usually treats humans, and senior vet Dr Helen McCracken. X-rays were taken in areas where the orangutan has arthritis, her hips and ankles, as Dr Pirpiris then gave the ape a steroid injection which will reduce her pain for months and perhaps even years. Doctors were also able to give Suma a full check up, including her ears, teeth, and eyes, and also took urine and blood samples. Suma, a 36-year-old orangutan, undergoes a health check-up at Melbourne Zoo to assess the progress of her arthritis. Suma was first diagnosed with the painful condition in 2013 after keepers noticed some stiffness in her movements. X-rays were taken in areas where the orangutan has arthritis which includes her hips (pictured) and ankles. In June she will turn 37 years old, which is late middle age for an orangutan, so arthritis is not unexpected. Initially, keepers helped alleviate the condition by giving Suma daily pain medication. Zoo vets took the opportunity to give Suma a full check-up including her ears, teeth and eyes. Suma is transported to and from the examination room by Melbourne zoo keepers on Thursday. Surgeon Associate Professor Marino Pirpiris, who more typically treats humans, joined senior vet Dr. Helen McCracken to look Suma over. Doctors had to anaesthetise Suma in order to check how her arthritis has progressed since 2013. Dr Pirpiris also gave the ape a steroid injection which will reduce her pain for months and perhaps even years.

Article: Cairo (CNN)At least 12 people were killed Sunday, and more injured, in separate attacks on a police station, a checkpoint and along a highway in Egypt's northern Sinai, authorities said. Six people, including one civilian, were killed when a car bomb exploded near the police station in Al-Arish, capital of North Sinai, Health Ministry spokesman Hossam Abdel-Ghafar told Ahram Online. He said 40 people were injured. Ansar Beit Al-Maqdis, an ISIS affiliate, claimed responsibility for the attack, which came hours after another operation that the group also claimed. In that earlier attack, a first lieutenant, a sergeant and four conscripts were killed when their armored vehicle was attacked on the highway from Al-Arish to Sheikh Zuweid in northern Sinai, the military said. Two other soldiers were injured and taken to a military hospital. Ansar Beit Al-Maqdis has claimed many attacks against the army and police in Sinai. A third attack Sunday on a checkpoint in Rafah left three security personnel injured, after unknown assailants opened fire at them, according to state media. The attacks come as the military announced a reshuffle of several senior military positions, state media reported. Among those being replaced are the generals in charge of military intelligence and Egypt's second field army, which is spearheading the battle against the insurgents in the northern Sinai. Egypt's army has been fighting a decade-long militant Islamist insurgency, which has spiked since the ouster of Muslim Brotherhood president Mohamed Morsy in the summer of 2013. Hundreds of police and soldiers, as well as civilians, have been killed in militant attacks in the past months. Ian Lee reported from Cairo. Anas Hamdan reported from Atlanta.

Article: The greatest challenge to Rory McIlroy's grand slam bid or Tiger Woods' latest comeback at this week's Masters could come from Mother Nature. Players endured rainy spells during their  practice on Tuesday with forecasts that the wet weather is set continue once the tournament gets underway  on Thursday April 9. The typically warm and humid Georgia weather is expected to be unsettled by a cold front heading into Augusta for the weekend, which is likely to bring more showers and thunderstorms, especially on Friday and Saturday. Rory McIlroy hides under an umbrella as the heaven's open during practice on Tuesday. World No 1 makes his way through the rain ahead of his bid to complete a career grand slam.

Fitzgerald holds an umbrella over the player's head to let him take a putt. Spectators, wrapped in an assortment of weatherproofs, are caught in a deluge while walking the course. Despite using an umbrella to shield himself from the elements on Tuesday, McIlroy could find himself facing record high temperatures on the first day of play - with the mercury expected to reach 90F, approaching the record 91F set in 2011. Augusta National has its own weather centre where officials can keep an eye on any extreme changes and evacuate players, spectators and staff from the course if necessary. According to Accuweather.com, Thursday and Sunday will likely be the best weather days at the tournament while Friday and Saturday carry potential for storms with strong winds. Many spectators were forced to watch their heroes hone their swings from under shelter, although the course's state of the art drainage system mean that play is unlikely to be delayed. Weather reports have forecast unseasonably high temperatures and stormy weather across the four days. Spectators may have to get used to taking cover beneath trees, especially on Friday and Saturday. A cold front coming over Georgia is likely to bring more stormy weather and strong winds. Golf fans flock to leave August National as the rain pours down on Tuesday.

However Julen Lopetegui has warned his side has plenty of room to improve saying the team 'hasn't stopped growing'. When Lopetegui comes up against his former Barcelona team-mate Pep Guardiola, who the former goalkeeper labels  'a winner', at Dragao on Wednesday night, it will be a clash of the two most prolific scoring sides of the tournament so far. 'We come into this tie being able to enjoy what we have accomplished and aiming to give our best in both games, as we always do,' Lopetegui told Goal.com. Porto train ahead of their Wednesday clash against Bayern Munich in their Champions League quarter-finalo. Julen Lopetegui says Porto come into the match able to enjoy their achievement of being undefeated. Lopetegui exits the Dragao tunnel with its Champions League branding in place and ready for Bayern. With a number of new players in the summer still meshing with the squad Porto have room for improvement. 'Many new players arrived last summer, but we have our idea of playing and the team has worked very well since the beginning of the season. 'We started this project with great enthusiasm and the purpose of qualifying the team for the Champions League [from the playoffs]. From there, the team hasn't stopped growing - travelling on its own path.' Porto were clinical in their last Champions League start breezing past Basle 4-0 to claim the last-16 tie 5-1 on aggregate, while Bayern demolished Shakhtar Donetsk 7-0 after a 0-0 first leg.

Atletico Madrid, Monaco and Bayern are the only sides to have been more frugal. Guardiola, a two-time Champions League winner with Barcelona and Super Cup winner with Bayern, showed his former fellow Spain squad member plenty of respect ahead of the match.

Article: (CNN)Cynthia Lennon, who married John Lennon when he was a struggling musician and was there when he rose to fame with the Beatles, died Wednesday, according to a post on the website of her son, Julian. She was 75. "Cynthia Lennon passed away today at her home in Mallorca, Spain, following a short but brave battle with cancer.  Her son Julian Lennon was at her bedside throughout," his website says.  "The family are thankful for your prayers. Please respect their privacy at this difficult time." John and Cynthia Lennon were married for six years, from 1962 to 1968. The pair met at art school, where Cynthia studied to be an illustrator and John practiced painting -- in between concerts with a band that would become the Beatles. "When we were at art college, I think he was more interested in the music than he was in the art," she told ClassicBands.com. Cynthia Lennon, born Cynthia Powell in 1939, was a stabilizing force for the young John, who lost his mother when he was a teenager and was raised by his Aunt Mimi. "John was always insecure," she said in a 2005 interview, having lost his mother at a young age. But his humor -- and his wildness -- were attractive, she told ClassicBands.com. "He was a rebel. He was outrageous. That was something I hadn't experienced before the age that I was, which was about 16 or 17. I'd had quite a normal, straightforward life," she said. "I was just instantly attracted to him." The two married in 1962, just as the Beatles were making their rise. Their son, Julian, was born April 8, 1963. Lennon's sometimes-brittle personality and his overwhelming fame became a challenge for Cynthia. During her pregnancy, "I was not supposed to be known or heard about. In the wisdom, or lack of wisdom, anything to do with somebody becoming famous, male, was not supposed to be married or have (a) girlfriend." She was threatened by fans and occasionally in danger of being left behind in the band's whirlwind; when the group traveled to Bangor, Wales, to meet with the Maharishi in 1967, Cynthia was caught in a scrum and couldn't make the train in time. She was also there on the 1965 night George Harrison, Patti Boyd and Lennon were dosed with LSD -- an experience she disliked -- and traveled to India with the band in early 1968. The couple divorced in 1968, by which time John was seeing Yoko Ono. Cynthia Lennon married three more times after John and wrote two books about her marriage to the Beatle, "A Twist of Lennon" and "John." She had no contact with the surviving members of the band until meeting up at the 2006 Las Vegas premiere of "The Beatles Love." For all the difficulties and disappointments -- she described Julian, for whom she wrote "John," as "very scarred by life" -- she acknowledged that the whirlwind could also be enthralling. "The whole situation changed my life completely. God knows where I would've been ended up. I probably would've been a schoolteacher with about three or four children in a boring situation," she told ClassicBands.com. "I've had the most amazing life, a wonderful life." She is survived by her son. Her fourth husband, Noel Charles, died in 2013. People we've lost in 2015. CNN's Josh Levs contributed to this story.

Article: Louis van Gaal couldn’t let the moment pass. Manchester United had just rattled off their 13th home win of the season and the Dutchman wanted to crank up the pressure. A comfortable victory over Aston Villa, inspired by two goals from the excellent Ander Herrera and crowned by Wayne Rooney’s magnificent strike, had seen United leap above Manchester City in the table for the first time since November 23, 2013. When you think on January 10 this year the gap between the two clubs was 10 points, the turnaround has been remarkable. But now, as they head into their latest local squabble, there is mounting confidence around Old Trafford that United will not surrender their position. Louis van Gaal has piled pressure on Manchester City ahead of their games against Crystal Palace and United. Manchester United picked up all three points at the weekend by beating Aston Villa 3-1 at Old Trafford. Van Gaal believes Manchester City's players may struggle to get to grips with being in fourth spot. MANCHESTER UNITED (4-3-3): De Gea 6; Valencia 7, Jones 7, Rojo 7, Blind 7: Herrera 8.5, Carrick 7, Fellaini 6.5 (Falcao 77mins): Mata 7.5, Rooney 8, Young 6.5 (Di Maria 70. 6.5) Subs not used: Valdes, Rafael, Januzaj, McNair, Pereira. Scorers: Herrera 43, 90, Rooney 79. ASTON VILLA (4-4-2): Guzan 7: Hutton 5.5 (Bacuna 46, 5), Okore 5.5, Clark 5.5, Lowton 5: N’Zogbia 5 (Baker 61, 5), Sanchez 6, Delph 6, Weimann 5 (Cole 77): Benteke 6.5, Agbonlahor 5. Subs not used: Given, Vlaar, Gil, Grealish. Booked: Delph. Scorer: Benteke 80. Man of the match: Ander Herrera. Referee: Roger East 6. Is it feasible for City to finish fourth? They face Crystal Palace on Monday evening and Van Gaal believes dropping down two positions will creep into the psychology of Manuel Pellegrini’s squad. Even if City win at Selhurst Park, how will they handle the furnace that awaits this Sunday? ‘It plays a part in the spirit of the players — of our opponents but also our players,’ said Van Gaal. ‘We have more confidence now and when (if) they lose a point against Crystal Palace, then it is also sitting in their minds. ‘I don’t know the individual players of Manchester City so well, so I cannot judge them. But we have a lot of confidence and we haven’t lost so many times at home. The next game is going to be the decisive game.’ Van Gaal is aware recent history spells doom for United. They have lost seven of the last nine Manchester derbies, including each of the last four. Remarkably, they have not beaten City at home since Rooney scored that breath-taking bicycle kick in February 2011. City, few would dispute, have the better squad but, regardless of what happens in south London, will they be able to hold United’s momentum? Can they match their spirit? Big games are bringing the best out of Van Gaal’s men and they are clearly relishing the opportunity that awaits. Manchester United have not beaten City at Old Trafford since Wayne Rooney's wonder goal in February 2011. Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero scored in his side's 1-0 win over United back in November. Rooney likes playing against Villa — this was his 13th career goal against them. Newcastle (12) are his second favourite opponents. Man United lead rivals Man City by one point. ‘It was another Manchester United, I believe,’ said Van Gaal, when asked how he reflected on the 1-0 defeat he suffered at the Etihad Stadium in November. ‘We have developed the team. That was more in the start of the process and now we are in the end of the process. ‘So I think also the confidence of our players is very high at the moment but also our performances shows that so it’s not the same Manchester United. It’s like the game against Liverpool and the game (coming up) against Chelsea — you have to win these kinds of matches.’ With Liverpool’s defeat by Arsenal effectively ending the doubt over which sides will finish in the top four, it now becomes a question of what order Chelsea, Arsenal and the two Manchester clubs will be after the final games have been played. United’s run-in is laced with demanding assignments — aside from City, they must go to Stamford Bridge on April 18, face a trip to Goodison Park the following week and host Arsenal on May 16 — but they have an aura once more. Manchester United defender Chris Smalling saw red during the Premier League clash at the Etihad Stadium. Man United vs Man City - April 12. Chelsea vs Man United - April 18. Everton vs Man United - April 26. Man United vs West Brom - May 2. Crystal Palace vs Man United - May 9. Man United vs Arsenal - May 17. Hull vs Man United - May 24. Crystal Palace vs Man City - April 6. Man United vs Man City - April 12. Man City vs West Ham - April 19. Man City vs Aston Villa - April 25. Tottenham vs Man City - May 3. Man City vs QPR - May 10. Swansea vs Man City - May 17. Man City vs Southampton - May 24. Villa, stymied by injury problems that Tim Sherwood described as ‘crippling’, simply couldn’t cope once they went conceded in the 43rd minute and the manager, who was noticeably glum afterwards, can at least take solace from the fact Queens Park Rangers will not offer the same threat on Tuesday. ‘We know it will be tough but as long as we can play the way we have shown, especially in the last few games, it’s going to be a great game,’ said Ashley Young, who admitted he was ‘disappointed’ to not be selected for the last round of England games. ‘Hopefully we will get the three points. Of course it would be nice but we are just taking each game as it comes.’ There was never any hint they would slip up here, bossing the first half and then going through the gears after a slow period after the break to swat Villa aside. Herrara, with his slick passing and industry, was terrific. Rooney’s 14th strike of the campaign, meanwhile, was sensational. ‘It's about momentum, especially when you are going into this vital stage of the season,’ Young added. ‘United teams always come strong at this stage and we are showing in every game just how strong we can be – and even how we finish the game. We will enjoy this but it is all about next week.’ Ashley Young (left, pictured with Herrera) believes his side are building momentum ahead of the derby.

Article: (CNN)It's no surprise which image is making the headlines from this week's gathering of leaders from nearly three dozen nations in Panama: A historic handshake between President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro. But this first meeting of Obama and Castro since they announced plans to start normalizing diplomatic ties should not be the end of the summit story. Or at least Obama is hoping it won't be. After all, the President has had some unhappy experiences at hemispheric summits, where the headlines have often focused on some less than flattering moments. The reality is that the United States has been losing ground in this increasingly important region, and Obama needs to put on a strong performance in Panama at the Summit of the Americas if the U.S. is to have a chance of improving ties with neighbors who should be best friends, but who have drifted away as America has been focused on challenges at home and instability in the Middle East. Unfortunately, America has lost influence in Latin America to a hyperactive China, a cunning Russia and a troubling Iran, all of which have made inroads in the region at Washington's expense. This gathering therefore offers a chance for the U.S. to reverse the tide and build on the potential offered by a natural alliance strengthened by millions of people with Latin American and Caribbean blood who make their homes in the United States. The foundations for a strong hemispheric bloc are there. But they need attention, and the Panama meeting offers a good opportunity to start building. But first: Do no harm. Large diplomatic gatherings are minutely orchestrated events, and the U.S., with its vast experience in preparing for high-level multilateral meetings, knows the importance of dotting the I's and crossing the T's. But this hasn't stopped recent summits descending into diplomatic and PR disasters for the U.S. Just look at the last summit, held in Cartagena, Colombia, which stayed in the news much longer than anyone expected after Secret Service agents embarrassed the United States by hiring prostitutes and bringing them to their hotel rooms, in violation of basic security protocols. They were reportedly caught after one of the women accused an agent of refusing to pay an agreed fee. As a result of all this, the Americans looked dumb, incompetent -- and cheap. And back in 2009, the President -- new on the job -- was caught flat footed by a fast-talking, fiery anti-American president of Venezuela. The late Hugo Chavez outplayed the leader of the free world, who had just taken office and was trying to show America's new "outstretched hand" toward the foe of the George W. Bush era. The summit hit a depressing low for the Obama administration when Chavez walked up to Obama and, as the cameras clicked, handed the American President a copy of the book "Open Veins of Latin America," which blames the region's woes on the U.S. and Europe. Yet the problems in Cartagena weren't just symbolic. Regional leaders lined up against Washington, which had refused to include Cuba in the summit, and vowed they would not hold any more of the gatherings unless Havana was also invited. America was cornered. All this stands in contrast to the optimism of the early Clinton years, when the President issued an invitation to "democratically elected" heads of state of Latin America, which was then breaking the chains of military dictatorship. Back then, the U.S. had just led the creation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and actually seemed to stand for something attractive to the region, namely democracy, free trade and economic growth. That's what it should aim for every time: articulating a clear vision and rallying neighbors behind it. Can Obama manage something similar this time? True, the President has come armed with his new Cuba policy. Unfortunately, in an effort to placate critics who say Obama is not doing more for pro-democracy activists, the White House has miscalculated with Venezuela, handing the repressive regime of Chavez's successor, Nicolas Maduro, a stick with which to beat the U.S. Obama has long and rightly ignored Maduro's claims that the U.S. planned to overthrow him. But a modest plan to impose sanctions has suddenly handed Maduro -- who has presided over an economic catastrophe in his country -- a way to portray himself a victim of the U.S., something he will no doubt play that up in Panama. All this risks again reviving memories of past tensions with Latin Americans who already have complicated feelings toward the U.S. over its Cold War support for unseemly right-wing dictators, a policy it claimed to pursue in the name of preventing Soviet-backed communism from taking hold. But those days are behind us. Today, the people want prosperity, they want democracy, and they want the rule of law -- all of which leave a potential opening for the United States. Too many national leaders are eroding democratic norms: Opposition leaders are in prison in Venezuela; a prosecutor who criticized the President was found dead in Argentina; press freedom is under siege in several countries; and corruption is reaching new highs. All of this suggests that if Obama plays his cards right, he will have the opportunity to explain to the people of Latin America that their goals are also America's goals; that like them, he supports democracy, human rights, the rule of law, full freedom of expression and free elections in every country. The fact that he met with Cuban dissidents was welcome, and sends a message that he is not neglecting other issues such as human rights as he recasts relations with Cuba. For the millions in Latin America that still live in poverty, these freedoms can seem like a distant luxury. But if Obama can show them that the United States is a true partner in efforts to improve their lives, then he will leave a longer-lasting legacy in the region than just a handshake.

Article: Manchester City's FA Cup-winning goalkeeper, Harry Dowd, has died, aged 76. Dowd, a member of the side who beat Leicester City 1-0 at Wembley in 1969, played 181 games in nine years at Maine Road. The Salford-born keeper once famously scored for City, against Bury, after switching to centre forward in a game in 1964, having broken his thumb. Harry Dowd (third from right) celebrates after Manchester City win the FA Cup at Wembley in 1969. He joined the club as an amateur at the age of 20 in 1958 and carried on working as a plumber after turning professional two years later. Former City player Fred Eyre paid tribute to Dowd, praising the popular stopper. 'Harry was one of the most popular at the club, we all used to love Harry,' said Eyre. 'He was a great goalkeeper.' 'When we had training he would come over and train with the team, and then afterwards he would go straight back to work.' Dowd was succeeded at City by Joe Corrigan but continued playing at Stoke City before ending his career at Oldham Athletic in 1974. Dowd was a talented goalkeeper who continued working as a plumber throughout his professional career.

Article: (CNN)Parents who refuse to vaccinate their children can lose up to $11,000 of welfare benefits a year under a new government policy, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has announced. Currently parents can choose to opt out of vaccinations for medical or religious reasons, or by stating they are "conscientious objectors," and still receive taxpayer funded child care benefits. Under the new "no jab, no pay" policy, the exemption as a conscientious objector will be removed starting January 2016. "The choice made by families not to immunize their children is not supported by public policy or medical research nor should such action be supported by taxpayers in the form of child care payments," said Abbott in a joint statement with Social Services Minister, Scott Morrison. Thousands of families could lose out on welfare payments, with the Australian government estimating more than 39,000 children under the age of seven have not been vaccinated because of their parents' objections. The number of children in Australia who have not received immunization against measles and other diseases has almost doubled in the past decade, according to the government. Anti-vaccination campaigns have recently gained traction in Western countries. Some parents believe the shots cause autism, but the theory has been widely discredited. Existing exemptions on medical or religious grounds will continue said Abbott, but guidelines on religious exemptions will be tightened. "It requires the formal position of that religious body being advised to the government and approved by the government. This is a very significant narrowing," Morrison told reporters in Sydney on Sunday. He added that no mainstream religious organizations have made any formal objection to immunizations. In response to the announcement, more than 7,000 people have signed a petition in opposition to the reforms.

Article: Jonathan Brownlee backed up his win in Auckland a fortnight ago by taking the Gold Coast Triathlon in the ITU World Series on Saturday. The Yorkshireman moved amongst the leaders on the swim, remained at the front during the cycle and then broke clear in the run, seeing off Mario Mola by 19 seconds with a winning time of 1:46:53. 'I think it's down to confidence,' he said of his victory. Jonathan Brownlee poses with his gold medal on the podium having won the Gold Coast ITU race. 'After the start of the season I had an awful race, I said I didn't want to make mistakes again. Today it started really well. I saw the four of us and thought lets be aggressive. 'On the run I knew they would take time out of me on the first lap, then I thought 'be steady, and if I run 30:30 it's going to take a great run for them to catch me', and fortunately they didn't.' World champion Javier Gomez took third. As a result Brownlee leads the rankings with 2,186 points from Gomez, who is 219 points behind. Brownlee broke clear of the field during the running section of the Gold Coast triathlon in Australia. In the women's race, Gwen Jorgensen racked up an eighth series victory in a row, leading a clean sweep of Americans on the podium with Sarah True second and Katie Zaferes third.

Article: (CNN)A New Jersey auction house has removed items from its April 17 event after an uproar from the public. The items are crafts and artifacts made by Japanese-Americans confined to World War II internment camps. A grass-roots campaign of a change.org petition, a Facebook page, and mediation by "Star Trek" actor George Takei has resulted in Rago Arts and Auction Center agreeing to pull the items from the sale. "There is an essential discussion to be had about the sale of historical items that are a legacy of man's inhumanity to man. It extends beyond what is legal. It is something auction houses, galleries and dealers are faced with regularly," the auction house said. "We hope this controversy will be the beginning of a discourse on this issue." Takei, who with his family spent time in one of the camps, thanked people for working to stop the sale. According to a comment on the Facebook page "Japanese American History: NOT for Sale," he was working on the issue while on a trip to Australia. "It took a few calls today here in the wee hours, and I'll be issuing a formal statement later, but we can all celebrate a bit today at this news," he wrote. The auction house said 24 lots of an original collection of works of art and crafts were removed. During World War II, about 117,000 people of Japanese descent were forced to live in 10 internment camps. The government called them relocation centers. Many of the people who lived there and their descendants had another phrase for the facilities. They call them concentration camps. Two-thirds of the people who were ordered there were native born U.S. citizens, according to the National Archives. CNN affiliate KGO reported the items were given to historian Allen Eaton, who opposed internment camps. The items were inherited from the historian's estate. Miriam Tucker, a partner with the auction house, said it had hoped the items would go to someone who cared about their historical meaning. "For us, there could be no better resolution than for a suitable museum, foundation or members of the Japanese-American community with the means to preserve this collection to come forward and secure it for education, display and research," she said. KGO reported the people it talked to would like items returned to family members if possible and any other artifacts put in an exhibition. "This was a gift and let the gift come full circle," said Judy Hamaguchi with the San Francisco Chapter of the Japanese American Citizens League. She was referring to a letter the organization sent to the auction house. "It should be returned as a gift." The lots have been packed away for now, said auction house partner David Rago in an email. "Once the dust settles from this auction weekend (1,200 lots in three days) we will work with a small group of people from the Japanese-American community who have identified themselves through this process as generous, informed, voices of reason," he wrote. He said a suitable institution is the best possible home and the auction house will work with the current owner to find the right place. The seller -- known in the auction business as the consignor -- has never been in a position where the items could be donated, Rago said. "But the consignor, who has been a sensitive and dedicated custodian of this collection for over 35 years, has agreed this evening to work with Rago Auctions to secure appropriate placement of Eaton's life work," he added.

Article: Arsene Wenger has branded the emerging trend of post-season tours as a 'nightmare' after revealing Arsenal opted against an extended pre-season trip. Tottenham have confirmed they will travel to Australia and Malaysia at the end of the Premier League season, while Chelsea are also set to travel abroad when the current campaign finishes. Overseas tours are an important component of clubs PR strategies as they look to maximise their earning potential away from England. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has slammed post season tours as a nightmare. Calum Chambers battles with Radamel Falcao during the Emirates Cup pre-season tournament. But they can also cause headaches for managers who feel such tours - particularly pre-season trips - hamper preparations. Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has successfully lobbied for a shorter than anticipated tour of the US this summer. Likewise, Arsenal were exploring the idea of playing additional matches in either India or Malaysia after their initial trip to Singapore - but have decided against it, a decision Wenger is happy with. 'I'm pleased with that because pre-season is always difficult if you cannot prepare well,' said the Arsenal manager. Chelsea are one of several Premier League sides who will be travelling overseas after the season. North London rivals Tottenham will be heading to Australia and Malaysia after the season is done. 'Lets not forget they voted to start early in August next season, which is a bit of nightmare when you think you start on August 8. 'Some players play until June 21 in the Copa America, some in the European Under-21 Championship play until June 14. 'After a season where we have no winter break, I don't see where you go from there to give players a proper rest. It's impossible. 'It is difficult because of the commercial aspect but you want to find a compromise.' Louis van Gaal has successfully lobbied for Manchester United's US tour to be cut short. On the prospect of the Gunners organising a future post-season tour, Wenger, who's side face Burnley on Saturday, added: 'Post season tours are a nightmare - I will never do it. 'In pre-season you have the players under pressure with the focus of starting the season well. 'A post-season tour, I always feel people come along to watch but the players are half on their holidays. 'It is a relaxed atmosphere with none of the intensity of a pre-season game. 'Maybe it is a holiday tour and good to have a relaxed atmosphere together. But from a purely football point of view, there is not much meaning – let’s be honest.'

Article: Duhok, Iraqi Kurdistan (CNN)In the canvas expanse of the Shariya refugee camp, thousands of Yazidis live within hearing distance of one of Iraqi Kurdistan's frontlines with ISIS. The vast majority of the camp's occupants are from the town of Sinjar and fled the ISIS assault there back in August. But not everyone escaped. ISIS took thousands of Yazidis captive. Men faced a choice -- convert to Islam or be shot. But the Islamist militants separated the young women and girls to be sold as sex slaves. In its fourth edition of "Dabiq," the ISIS online magazine, an article titled "The revival of slavery before the hour," outlines the group's twisted justification and guidelines for the enslavement of the Yazidis. "One should remember that enslaving the families of the kuffar (infidels) and taking their women as concubines is a firmly established aspect of Shariah," the article reads. We're told that women who have just given birth or are breastfeeding are considered impure and cannot be taken as sexual slaves -- but Hanan, 19, was neither of those things. "They separated all of us," she says. "They dragged us away by our hair. They took married women, young ones. The youngest with us was just 10.  We were all crying. "They said we are going to marry you off, you will forget your family." ISIS: Enslaving, having sex with 'unbelieving' women, girls is OK. For the first week, Hanan was held with 50 others, regularly beaten and threatened with torture, and fed just a bowl of rice. The group was then taken to a three story building in Mosul she described as a sex slave warehouse, where hundreds of girls and women were held. "They would line about 50 of us up at a time, in rows of 10.  They would say don't move, don't cry or we will beat you. The men would come in and describe the kind of girl they wanted and then they would pick and choose as they pleased," she recalls. She was eventually chosen, part of a group of 25.  From that group Hanan was separated into a smaller group of seven and taken into a house in a village. 'Treated like cattle': Yazidi women sold, raped, enslaved by ISIS. Two ISIS fighters guarded the door and ordered the girls to clean and bathe themselves. "They brought in a Yazidi girl who had been with them for two months. She was wearing the black niqab. They said to us we are going to do to you what we did to her," Hanan says. "The girl spoke to us in Kurdish and said they beat me, they cuffed me and raped me." Hanan and the others decided they had to try to escape. That night they crawled out the bedroom window. "The fourth girl jumped out, I was the fifth. I crawled to the wall and was about to jump over it and then I saw their flashlight," she tells me. "They caught the last two girls." They ran, and somehow evaded capture.  Four hours later they were out of ISIS territory. "If I just see someone with a beard I start shaking," Hanan says. Now physically free but mentally still captive, Hanan remains tormented -- like so many others, by what she has been through and what those still with ISIS are being forced to endure -- a fate worse than death. Fleeing ISIS -- A Yazidi family's tale.

Article: (CNN)Donald Sterling's racist remarks cost him an NBA team last year. But now it's his former female companion who has lost big. A Los Angeles judge has ordered V. Stiviano to pay back more than $2.6 million in gifts after Sterling's wife sued her. In the lawsuit, Rochelle "Shelly" Sterling accused Stiviano of targeting extremely wealthy older men. She claimed Donald Sterling used the couple's money to buy Stiviano a Ferrari, two Bentleys and a Range Rover, and that he helped her get a $1.8 million duplex. Who is V. Stiviano? Stiviano countered that there was nothing wrong with Donald Sterling giving her gifts and that she never took advantage of the former Los Angeles Clippers owner, who made much of his fortune in real estate. Shelly Sterling was thrilled with the court decision Tuesday, her lawyer told CNN affiliate KABC. "This is a victory for the Sterling family in recovering the $2,630,000 that Donald lavished on a conniving mistress," attorney Pierce O'Donnell said in a statement. "It also sets a precedent that the injured spouse can recover damages from the recipient of these ill-begotten gifts." Stiviano's gifts from Donald Sterling didn't just include uber-expensive items like luxury cars. According to the Los Angeles Times, the list also includes a $391 Easter bunny costume, a $299 two-speed blender and a $12 lace thong. Donald Sterling's downfall came after an audio recording surfaced of the octogenarian arguing with Stiviano. In the tape, Sterling chastises Stiviano for posting pictures on social media of her posing with African-Americans, including basketball legend Magic Johnson. "In your lousy f**ing Instagrams, you don't have to have yourself with -- walking with black people," Sterling said in the audio first posted by TMZ. He also tells Stiviano not to bring Johnson to Clippers games and not to post photos with the Hall of Famer so Sterling's friends can see. "Admire him, bring him here, feed him, f**k him, but don't put (Magic) on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me," Sterling said. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver banned Sterling from the league, fined him $2.5 million and pushed through a charge to terminate all of his ownership rights in the franchise.

Article: Gary Mabbutt has spoken for the first time about how he was left with a 30 inch scar following a five hour operation to save his leg. The ex-Tottenham and England star, 53, was rushed to hospital after waking up at 1am to find that the leg had gone cold back in 2013. Mabbutt's diabetes had led to a clogged artery in the limb and doctors warned him it was 'touch and go' on whether it would have to be amputated. Gary Mabbutt has been left with a 30inch scar on his left leg after his diabetes caused an artery to be clogged. He was treated at King's College Hospital in south east London, undergoing an emergency five-hour operation. Surgeons were required to replace the main artery in his left leg with a vein and needed 112 staples to seal the horrific wound. Mabbutt, who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at 17, will not be able to play football again, leaving his dream of becoming a manager in tatters. As he is unable to train with players on the pitch, he has been forced to turn down roles in coaching. Surgeons were required to replace the main artery in his left leg with a vein and needed 112 staples to seal it. The Spurs legend has spoken for the first time about the agony he went through and says he hopes to raise awareness of his condition. Speaking to The Sun, he said: 'When they talked about battling to save my leg, I realised I was helpless. As a diabetic you know complications can occur. But you think "It's never going to happen to me". It is vital to educate everyone with diabetes how to take care of themselves. If you have anything unusual with your feet, tingly toes, blisters, see your doctor.' In 1982, father-of-two Mabbutt became the first diabetic ever to play for England and captained Tottenham to FA cup glory in 1991. Former star: Mabbutt is pictured, left, lifting the FA Cup while playing for Tottenham in  1991. He was unaware that his diabetes had triggered peripheral arterial disease, clogging up the blood vessels in the legs. Every year, surgeons perform around 8,000 amputations on diabetics in the UK - but campaigners say four out five could be prevented. Amputations cost the NHS £650million a year - and up 80 per cent of the amputees die within five years. Diabates sufferers are entitled to annual eye tests as they are are 20 times more likely to develop sight problems, but Gary Mabbutt wants a similar programme to apply to feet. Experts say millions of diabetics are unaware their condition could lead to foot problems and agree regular checks could save limbs.

Article: (CNN)Jason Rezaian has sat in jail in Iran for nearly nine months. The Washington Post's bureau chief in Tehran was arrested in July on unspecified allegations. It took more than four months for a judge to hear charges against him. They remained publicly undisclosed until last week. The Iranian-American will be tried soon on espionage, Tehran's chief justice said. He is accused of economic spying, the Post reported, citing Iranian state media. The Washington Post did not mince words on the allegation. "Any charges of that sort would be absurd, the product of fertile and twisted imaginations," the paper said in a statement. The State Department also reacted with term "absurd" after hearing of reports in Iran's press about the charges. "If the reports are true, these charges are absurd, should be immediately dismissed and Jason should be immediately freed so that he can return to his family," the State Department official said. Since officers picked up Rezaian and his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, on July 22 at their home, the Post, the State Department and Rezaian's family have protested and called for his release. Salehi was released on bail in October. Rezaian was denied bail. And for months, he was denied access to proper legal representation, his family has said. Boxing great Muhammad Ali, also an American Muslim, appealed to Tehran last month to give Rezaian full access to legal representation and free him on bail. "To my knowledge, Jason is a man of peace and great faith, a man whose dedication and respect for the Iranian people is evident in his work," Ali said in a religiously worded statement. The journalist has also not been allowed to see visitors aside from his wife and has endured long interrogations, family members have said. In December, after a 10-hour hearing, Rezaian signed a paper to acknowledge that he understood the charges against him, the Post reported. Iran's human rights chief, Mohammad Javad Larijani, told news outlet France 24 last year that he hoped Rezaian's case would come to a positive conclusion. He said, "Let us hope that this fiasco will end on good terms." More on detained Americans. CNN's Sara Mazloumsaki and Azadeh Ansari contributed to this report.

Article: 'Kondogbia was incredible for Monaco, he was exactly the player Arsenal needed to sign,' Sportsmail's Jamie Redknapp said back in February. The French midfielder had just put in a dominant display at the Emirates Stadium as the Ligue 1 side all-but-sealed their place in the quarter-finals of the Champions League after a 3-1 first-leg win. But rather than Arsenal, it now seems Liverpool hold the main Premier League interest in the 22-year-old. So, what more do you need to know? Monaco midfielder Geoffrey Kondogbia is a Liverpool target and has also interested Arsenal in recent years. 22? He's been around for a while... Despite his young age, Kondogbia has amassed over 100 league appearances for Lens, Monaco, and even Sevilla. And during that five-year professional career, the central midfielder has been constantly watched by Arsenal scouts. He also impressed at the FIFA Under-20 World Cup alongside Paul Pogba in the French midfield, while his frame and playing style doesn't exactly scream 22 years old. Kondogbia is only 22 but has racked up over 100 league appearances with Lens (above), Sevilla and Monaco. The central midfielder was a key player for France alongside Paul Pogba at the Under 20 World Cup in 2013. Tough guy then? Exactly. Standing at 6'2", Kondogbia is a real presence in the Monaco midfield, allowing the likes of Joao Moutinho to strut their stuff further forward. He's strong in the tackle, but make no mistake, his prowess on the ball is also impressive. Possessing a fine left foot, Kondogbia doubles up as a playmaker, and also scored the first goal in the tie in the first leg against Arsenal. Having made his mark in both Ligue 1 and La Liga, you could say the Frenchman is the perfectly well-rounded midfielder, someone who would fit in seamlessly in the Premier League... Kondogbia's fine strike put Monaco in front against Arsenal in the Champions League last-16 first leg. So why haven't we seen him in England? Time is still on Kondogbia's side, but Premier League clubs have certainly tried. Arsenal were heavily linked with him before he left Sevilla, though the versatile player bought out his contract and opted for Monaco. With Liverpool crying out for players to freshen up an ageing/departing spine, the 22-year-old's presence would surely suit Brendan Rodgers. But he must move quick, with Real Madrid, Manchester United, Juventus and Paris St Germain all keen to sign the man who has been capped three times by his national team. Mesut Ozil swapped shirts with Kondogbia at half-time in the second leg at the Stade Louis II.

Geoffrey Kondogbia impressed against Arsenal in the Champions League. Gunners have scouted French midfielder for some time. But now Liverpool hold the main Premier League interest in midfielder. 22-year-old is currently at Monaco but has also played for Lens and Sevilla.

Article: (CNN)NBA player Thabo Sefolosha says police caused his season-ending leg injury when he was arrested last week after leaving a nightclub in New York. In a statement Tuesday, the guard/forward for the Atlanta Hawks described his injury as "significant," and said it "was caused by the police." Sefolosha suffered a fractured fibula and ligament damage when he and teammate Pero Antic were arrested near the scene of the stabbing of Indiana Pacers forward Chris Copeland and two other women early April 8. Police said Sefolosha and Antic were not involved in the stabbing incident, but they were charged with misdemeanors, including disorderly conduct and obstructing governmental administration. TMZ Sports released video last week that shows a group of police officers arresting the 6-foot-7 Sefolosha and taking him to the ground. It also shows an officer within that group getting out a baton and extending it near him, but what may have caused the injury is not clear in the video. Sefolosha appears to be limping as he is led away by officers. New York Police Department Sgt. Daniel Doody said Wednesday that the matter is being reviewed by the Internal Affairs Bureau and would not comment further. Internal Affairs had no comment. Sefolosha did not specify his injury in his statement Tuesday, but the Hawks said last week that he has a fractured fibula and ligament damage, will undergo surgery and will miss the rest of the season, including the playoffs, which begin this weekend. The Hawks enter as the top seed in the NBA's Eastern Conference. Sefolosha, who turns 31 in May, is in his ninth NBA season and his first with the Hawks. He averaged 5.3 points per game this season. "I am extremely disappointed that I will not be able to join my teammates on the court during the playoffs and apologize to them for any distraction this incident has caused," Sefolosha said in his statement. "I will be cheering for them every step of the way and will be diligent in my rehabilitation. "On advice of counsel, I hope you can appreciate that I cannot discuss the facts of the case. Those questions will be answered by my attorney in a court of law. I will simply say that I am in great pain, have experienced a significant injury and that the injury was caused by the police." Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said in a statement last week, "This is a very difficult situation for Thabo and our thoughts and support will be with him during his recovery. We know that his approach and dedication will serve him well in his rehabilitation. Our team remains focused and will be prepared as we head into the postseason." Antic, a 31-year-old, 6-foot-11 center/forward, missed the April 8 game against the Brooklyn Nets, but has played since then. In a joint statement last week, Sefolosha and Antic said they will contest the charges. According to the Pacers, Copeland underwent surgery on his abdomen and left elbow for stab wounds. He was released from the hospital two days after the incident, according to Bleacher Report. The Pacers, with one regular-season game left, are trying to secure the last spot in the Eastern Conference playoffs. If they do, their first-round opponent would be Atlanta. CNN's Camille Cava contributed to this report.

A social media campaign has been launched for the match,  which will be shown live on Sky Sports, in a bid to ensure they are watched by their lowest ever Premier League crowd. Fans who don't want to turn their back on the players with Newcastle just above the relegation zone have been encouraged to take part in demonstrations held both before and after the game at St James' Park. Newcastle fans are planning to boycott the club's next home game against Tottenham. A website Sack Ashley.com has been set up by the same supporters behind Sack Pardew campaign earlier in the season, which played a part in former manager Alan Pardew's decision to quit in January to take charge of Crystal Palace. 'Whether people choose to boycott or attend the match, apathy is no longer a viable option,' said a campaign spokesman. 'AshleyOut.com will actively participate in this boycott and promote any such action, endeavouring to provide materials, manpower and publicity. This is a perfect example of the sort of direct action AshleyOut.com always planned to encourage and support. We will work alongside all supporters and supporter representatives to ensure the protest is successful. Fans who don't want to turn their backs on the players will be encouraged to take part in other demos. 'We would like to invite you to join us for a visual and audible protest in Leazes Park starting 30 minutes before kick-off (3:30pm) and continuing until full-time, followed by a post-game protest under the Milburn Stand, for which protest materials will be provided. 'While encouraging as many as possible to participate, our primary motivation will always be to unite fans in action against Ashley both inside and outside the stadium. 'Each of us has our own personal motivation for deciding to join the boycott of this particular game as a form of protest or not and we respect that. If you feel you cannot miss the game for whatever reason, but sympathise with our protest, we would encourage you to join us for the pre-match protest at the Leazes End, where we can provide you with protest materials to express your discontent with Mike Ashley inside the stadium, and to join us for the post game protest under the Milburn Stand.' Newcastle boss John Carver suffered a fourth successive defeat at Sunderland on Sunday. The boycott and protests have also received the support of the Newcastle United Supporters Trust, who released the following statement on its website. 'We are aware of a new supporters group Ashleyout.com which wishes for the removal of Mike Ashley as the owner of Newcastle United. NUST believe in supporter representation/ownership and we have tried to engage the club for years to no avail. 'We understand why supporters are so frustrated that they see such action as necessary. While it is not our campaign, we support action that is intended to bring about change in ownership of the club particularly if it ultimately results in increased supporter representation/ownership.

Article: (CNN)Sometimes the best ideas come from the bathroom. But Gaioz Nigalidze's ideas from the loo were a little too good. The Georgian chess grandmaster has been banned from the Dubai Open Chess Tournament after officials discovered he was darting to the toilet to consult his smartphone, which was logged onto a chess analysis app, the Dubai Chess and Culture Club said. Nigalidze's opponent, Tigran Petrosian of Armenia, grew suspicious when Nigalidze kept bolting to the restroom. "The Armenian noticed the Georgian was oddly frequenting the toilet after each move during a crucial part of the game," the Dubai Chess and Culture Club said. When officials first checked Nigalidze, they didn't find any device on him, the club said. But after looking into the bathroom stall he visited, they found the smartphone hidden in toilet paper. At first, Nigalidze claimed the smartphone wasn't his, the Dubai chess organization said. But the phone was logged on to a social media network under his account. "They also found his game being analyzed in one of the chess applications," the chess club said. The infraction has been reported to the International Chess Federation. The Dubai tournament's chief arbiter, Mahdi Abdul Rahim, said players found guilty of cheating will be suspended for three years from all sanctioned tournaments and up to 15 years for a repeated offense, the chess and culture club said. But this wouldn't be an isolated case of cheating in high-stakes chess matches. In 2008, an Iranian player was banned from the Dubai Open after getting help from someone who was watching the game's live broadcast and was sending suggestions via text messages, the Dubai chess club said. Nigalidze's resume includes victories in the 2013 and 2014 Georgian Chess Championships. It's not clear how many times he went to the bathroom during those matches.

Article: Real Sociedad remain hopeful over a deal for Burnley striker Danny Ings. Liverpool, Manchester City and Manchester United have all shown interest in the England Under 21 international but have yet to sign him up as they consider other options also. Ings has interest from Borussia Monchengladbach among others but Sociedad have remained constant from the start. Real Sociedad are still hopeful of singing Burnley striker Danny Ings when his contract expires in the summer. Michel Vorm saves from Ings as the Burnley forward passes up a great chance to give his side the lead against Tottenham on Sunday. England Under 21 international Ings chats with Harry Kane after the final whistle at Turf Moor. The 23-year-old knows he can play regularly there, will be watched with interest by England coach Roy Hodgson and will get the money he wants. Sociedad manager David Moyes has taken the club into the top half of La Liga and intends to build on that in the summer and Ings could prove a key acquisition. Ings' contract at Burnley expires in the summer and is unlikely to sign another one regardless of their ability to survive relegation this season. Should Ings move to another Premier League club Burnley would be due a sizeable compensation fee because of his age, but that fee would be nominal if the striker moved abroad.

Danny Ings' contract expires in the summer and is set to leave Burnley. Real Sociedad want to take Ings to La Liga on a free transfer. Manager David Moyes faces competition from Liverpool among others.

Article: (CNN)While the fight against ISIS in Syria and Iraq holds the world's gaze, a simultaneous transformation is getting less attention: the deterioration of al Qaeda. In an audio message released Sunday, al Qaeda confirmed that two of its leaders, known as Ustad Ahmad Farooq and Qari Abdullah Mansur, were killed in CIA drone strikes in January in North Waziristan, near the Afghan-Pakistan border. Farooq's real name was Raja Mohammad Suleman, al Qaeda said. He was a Pakistani who acted as the group's liaison to the Pakistan Taliban and was the deputy commander of al Qaeda's South Asia branch. (Mansur's real name was Qari Ubaidullah, a Pakistani who oversaw suicide missions against U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan). Al Qaeda's South Asia branch is relatively new, announced with some fanfare back in September by al Qaeda's top leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri. The creation of the terror group's South Asia branch was seen by some terrorism analysts as an attempt to steal some of the limelight from ISIS, which is embroiled in a public dispute with al Qaeda for leadership of the global jihad movement. The deaths of the two men continue the decimation of al Qaeda's bench of leaders. On Monday, in the southern Pakistani city of Karachi, local al Qaeda commander Nurul Hassan was killed in a raid, said Arif Hanif, district inspector general of police. Florida-raised Adnan Shukrijumah, 39, who was in charge of al Qaeda's operations to attack the West, was killed in December in a Pakistani military operation. Texas-born Mohanad Mahmoud Al Farekh, who also played a planning role for al Qaeda's operations, was arrested in Pakistan last year. The deaths of Ubaidullah and Suleman underline the fact that there are almost no top leaders of al Qaeda left except al-Zawahiri. Both Ubaidullah and Suleman were Pakistani. This is an indicator of how al Qaeda has become a largely Pakistan-focused group, increasingly able to do nothing of any significance outside of Pakistan or Afghanistan. Indeed, al Qaeda has virtually no capacity to carry out attacks in the West. The last successful al Qaeda attack in the West was the London transportation system bombings a decade ago. Al Qaeda is now reduced only to holding American hostages such as 73-year-old aid worker Warren Weinstein, who was kidnapped from his home in the Pakistani city of Lahore on August 13, 2011. To be sure, al Qaeda's Yemen-based affiliate, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, continues to pose a threat to American aviation. The group has built hard-to-detect bombs, which it has placed on U.S.-bound flights. Luckily, those bombs were faulty or were detected. The group also trained one of the gunmen who attacked the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris in January, killing 12, but it's not clear if AQAP had any direct role in planning this attack. Meanwhile, ISIS continues to attract Western recruits and also inspire "homegrown" terrorists in the West, but the core al Qaeda organization that killed almost 3,000 men, women and children on 9/11 is on life support. Al Qaeda's confirmation of the deaths of Ubaidullah and Suleman is just one of the latest pieces of evidence for this assessment.

Article: Tulsa, Oklahoma (CNN)Amid growing scrutiny over whether a 73-year-old volunteer deputy who killed a suspect during a sting operation was qualified to be policing the streets, a new report raises a troubling allegation. Some supervisors at the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office were told to forge Reserve Deputy Robert Bates' training records, and three who refused were reassigned to less desirable duties, the Tulsa World newspaper reported. Claims that the volunteer deputy's records had been falsified emerged "almost immediately" from multiple sources after Bates killed Eric Harris on April 2, reporter Dylan Goforth said. Bates claims he meant to use his Taser but accidentally fired his handgun at Harris instead. The newspaper's story does not say who allegedly asked the supervisors to falsify the training records or why. But the orders apparently started years ago, before Harris' death, "back when (Bates) was trying to get on as a deputy," reporter Ziva Branstetter told CNN's "New Day." The Sheriff's Office denied the allegations in the Tulsa World's report. It also declined a CNN interview to respond to the claims. In an email to CNN, the department's Maj. Shannon Clark said the lack of named sources in the newspaper's report leaves him dubious. "Just keep in mind that the Tulsa World reporter cannot validate her sources and claims anonymity, which leaves us skeptical that her claims are unsubstantiated and deceptive," Clark wrote. Clark Brewster, an attorney who represents Bates, said the accusations are based on an affidavit from a former Sheriff's Office employee who's now facing a first-degree murder charge. "I don't put a lot of stock in that report or the credibility of who would further that report," Brewster said. Shooting casts spotlight on volunteer police programs. Sheriff Stanley Glanz and other sheriff's officials have repeatedly insisted Bates was properly trained. The Tulsa County Sheriff's Office has released a summary of Bates' training courses only over the past seven years. The office rejected CNN's request for the full training records because Bates' case is under investigation. Branstetter said she's run into similar obstacles when asking for the names of supervisors who'd signed off on Bates' training records. "You would think the Sheriff's Office, if in fact there has been no pressure applied, no falsification of records, that they would be forthcoming with these documents," she told CNN's "New Day." "We've asked for them. They've said they don't believe they're public records." Bates was classified as an advanced reserve deputy for the Sheriff's Office. That means he would have had to complete 480 hours of the field training officer program to maintain that classification, the paper said. Bates would also have needed firearms certification training. But the sheriff himself has acknowledged there is a problem with Bates' gun certification records -- his office can't find them. "Bob went out and qualified with three different weapons with an instructor," Glanz told KFAQ radio this week. He said Bates "qualified with a young lady that was a firearms instructor." But she is no longer there. "She has left the Sheriff's Office and is now a Secret Service agent," Glanz told KFAQ. "And we're trying to get a hold of her and talk to her about... we can't find the records that she supposedly turned in. So we're going to talk to her and find out if for sure he did qualify with those." Opinion: Who gave this reserve cop a gun? Even before the Tulsa World story, inconsistencies were apparent in Bates' history with the Sheriff's Office. In his statement to investigators, Bates said he "became an advanced TCSO Reserve Deputy in 2007." But the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office has said Bates had been a reserve deputy since 2008. It also said Bates had undergone 300 hours of training. That would be less than the 480 hours of field training that the Tulsa World said is required to be an "advanced" reserve deputy, which Bates claimed to be. In a statement he made to investigators after the shooting, Bates said the gun he used was his personal weapon, adding that he last qualified at the range in autumn. He also said he'd attended "numerous schools and seminars related to drug investigations and the tactical operations associated with the apprehension of suspects involved in drug trafficking," a five-day homicide investigation school in Dallas and training from Arizona's Maricopa County Sheriff's Office on responding to active shooters. But an Arizona official told CNN Bates never trained with the agency. "He didn't come to Arizona," the official from the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office said, "and he certainly didn't train with us." Brewster said that line in Bates' statement was referring to a lecture given at a seminar in Washington by Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio. The seminar was part of extensive training Bates received at classes across the country and through work in the field, he said. "He met every training regimen," Brewster said. "He met every requirement, and all he did was give of himself." Bates is now charged with second-degree manslaughter for Harris' death. He turned himself in to authorities Tuesday and immediately posted bail of $25,000. His attorney has said he's not guilty, calling the death an "excusable homicide." The lawyer for Harris' family claims Bates wasn't qualified to be on the force, but received preferential treatment because he'd made donations to the agency and was a friend of the sheriff -- an accusation officials deny, saying they stand by his training record. Tulsa Police Sgt. Jim Clark, who has been brought in to review the case, has said Bates fell "victim" to something called "slip and capture," a term to describe a high-stress situation in which a person intends to do one thing and instead does something else. It's a controversial claim that hasn't convinced critics of the department, and calls for an independent investigation into the Sheriff's Office and the case are growing. Earlier this week, the office spokesman rejected any idea of outside investigators into the shooting. "We're not scared to prosecute our own.... There's nobody in this culture that can be tougher on cops than their own," Clark said. "You know that analogy that you'll eat your young? You know, that's the same thing in law enforcement. If we have a dirty cop in our ranks, we will disclose them much quicker than the media." A spokesman for Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt said his office is concerned about allegations reported in the media about the case "and will continue to monitor and assess what appropriate measures, if any, are warranted." Glanz has stated publicly that he's reached out to the regional office of the FBI to look into the shooting. Special Agent Terry B. Weber told CNN there's no open FBI investigation into the case. How easy is it to confuse a gun for a Taser? CNN's Ed Lavandera reported from Tulsa. CNN's Holly Yan and Catherine E. Shoichet reported from Atlanta. CNN's Dave Alsup and Jason Morris contributed to this report.

Article: Has this brilliant 79th Masters got one final twist to reveal come the final round on Sunday? No-one would be surprised following the dramatic events of the third round, when the three biggest names in the sport combined with Justin Rose to throw the veritable kitchen sink at the cool 21 year old Texan Jordan Spieth. The young American coped so adeptly he gave up just one shot of his five stroke halfway lead and will partner Rose in the final round armed with a useful advantage. But there was just enough vulnerability shown in his finish to offer encouragement not only to Rose but Masters specialist Phil Mickelson, who will start five behind. Spieth is the third player his age to take a healthy lead into the final round. It worked out perfectly for Tiger Woods in 1997 but not so well for Rory McIlroy in 2011, who collapsed under the pressure over the final nine holes. ‘I think Jordan will cope better than I did because he was in the final group last year,’ said McIlroy. ‘I certainly expect him to cope a lot better than I did.’ Jordan Spieth carded a double bogey on the 17th but still set a new 54-hole scoring record at the Masters. At 16 under par, Spieth broke the record shared by Ray Floyd and Tiger Woods by a single shot. The other thing Spieth has in his favour is that this is the fourth tournament in a row when he has been in the final group in the final round. He won one and finished runner-up in the other two. If he wins, he will go to number two in the world and the rivalry with Rory that might dominate golf for the next decade will have begun. Spieth looked to have taken the tournament beyond everyone else when he went seven strokes clear with just two holes to play. But while Rose finished off with a staggering fifth birdie in his last six holes, Spieth was running up his first double bogey of the tournament at the 17th. And at the last there was a horrible fanned approach that threatened to trim the lead to just three, before Spieth conjured up a remarkable up and down to give him momentum heading into what promises to be another momentous Masters Sunday. Plucky journeyman Charley Hoffman lies fourth while Woods and McIlroy both shot 68 to be tied fifth and will play together on Sunday. But at ten shots off the pace they are surely too far behind. As for Rose, the 2013 US Open champion has given himself the chance of seizing another major following his astonishing finish. Pick of the quintet of birdies came at the par three 16th, where he holed a spectacular bunker shot. ‘I think it’s important to be in the final group, it’s where you want to be,’ said the 34 year old Englishman. ‘Jordan is obviously playing some very special golf but I have definitely given myself an opportunity.’ World No 1 Rory McIlroy and 14-time major winner Tiger Woods were in a five-way tie for fifth. Finally, the real McIlroy showed upon the par fives at Augusta on Saturday. What a day we had on Saturday. It was as if Rose and the big three in terms of charisma had come up with an unspoken pact and declared: ‘Ok, let’s see if this kid Jordan is really destined for greatness.’ For those who thought the runaway halfway leader had merely to turn up to claim the green jacket, we had McIlroy playing like the world number one and Tiger confounding the sceptics with a bravura display that made you feel the last 12 months had all been a bad dream. There was the glorious sight of Mickelson playing once more like he owns Augusta. And then there was Rose, who has had a lot of good days at Augusta in his ten Masters tournaments and now was enjoying one more. How would you like to see all that taking place in your rear view mirror, at this of all courses? In short, for five simply incredible hours the roars were echoing all over this sacred property and for most of that time they were funnelling in Spieth’s direction. This was undoubtedly as severe an examination as you could imagine for a third round. Just as well, then, that the creed that has served him so well already during his phenomenal 18 months as a professional just happens to be: ’Whenever the heat is on, ensure you focus just that little bit more.’ And that, for the most part, is just what he did. Only at the end did he look like stumbling, but that fabulous up and down at the last kept everything upbeat. Tiger Woods put on a vintage show, he was astonishing, electric, inspired and charismatic. Woods' girlfriend Lindsey Vonn showed her support during the third round on Saturday. The previous 54 hole standard of 15 under was set by Ray Floyd in 1976 and Woods in 1997. But the youngest first round leader in Masters history and the man who set a new low mark for 36 holes on Friday had reached 16 under after a 70. What made this so impressive was that, for the first time, a few errors crept into his previously immaculate game. During the round he would have three three putts and his first double. When things like this happen here it’s so easy for the mind to unravel but Spieth kept his composure. At the par five second that peerless putting stroke rapped home another birdie putt and one more at the sixth. At the treacherous 9th he seemed to have left himself a difficult second shot, from a downhill lie to an elevated green. Spieth knocked his approach to 6ft and holed that one as well to turn in 35 shots. In its own way, this was the equal of his spectacular bouts of scoring in the first two rounds. So it continued. The two stringent par fours to start the back nine were safely negotiated before his tee shot to the par three 12th came down 8ft from the flag. You can guess what happened next, and he birdied the 13th as well. He would threeputt the 14th, however – and then came the next test. Phil Mickelson played like the Masters specialist to finish the third round on 11 under. Justin Rose reeled off five birdies in the last six holes to move into second place on 12 under. As he made his way down the 15th fairway, first Mickelson and then Rose made amazing birdies at the 16th to send the crowd into raptures. How would he respond? Well, at the 15th he calmly stroked a four iron into the middle of the green for a two putt birdie. Best of all was the eight iron he struck to 8ft at the 16th for yet another birdie. McIlroy, Woods and Mickelson all shot sumptuous front nines of 32 shots. Mickelson was wearing a salmon pink shirt in honour of Arnold Palmer. Some of his great attacking play had been delivered wearing just such a colour and Mickelson was doing justice to the memory. Eight strokes off the pace at the start of play, he’s still in the ball game but will need another magic-filled round today. Add McIlroy’s wonderful back nine 31 from Friday afternoon to his front nine 32 yesterday, and you would have a round that equalled the course record of 63. Amazing how the switch flipped for him at the halfway point in the second round. So tentative to that point and perhaps a touch nervous with all that was at stake, it was as if he looked at a leaderboard that showed him 17 shots off the lead and a stroke outside the projected halfway cut and decided: ‘To hell with it, let’s go for it.’ Finally, the real McIlroy showed up on the par fives, those scoring holes that have given him such problems in recent years. An eagle at the 13th on Friday was followed by an eagle on the second in his third round. He was off and running. He birdied the long 8th plus the 13th and 15th for his best-ever return on the par fives during a single round at the Masters. A poor eight iron to the 16th cost him, however, as a 6ft par putt was dribbled miserably. Another bogey at the last as well meant a 68. And so the likely list of winners stands at just three – Spieth, Rose and Mickelson. It should be some final day. It has been some tournament.

Jordan Spieth set a Masters record 54-hole total of 16-under-par. The American carding a 70 to take a four-shot lead into the final round. Justin Rose collected five birdies on his final six holes to go 12 under. Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods were among those at six under after 68s.

Article: Stuart Armstrong admits taking receipt of his first Scottish Premiership league winners’ medal would help finalise the process of feeling like a Celtic player. For the young midfielder, a Parkhead title party next month would also help make up for the hurt he suffered at the very same venue 12 months previously. Last May, at the culmination of an exciting season on Tayside, Armstrong and his young Dundee United team-mates harboured high hopes of becoming just the third team in Tannadice history to lift the Scottish Cup. Celtic's Stuart Armstrong (right) is hoping to get his hands on the Scottish Premiership title. Armstrong completed a move from Dundee United to Celtic during the January transfer window. Following a 2-0 defeat in the final against St Johnstone, however, the 23-year-old was left crestfallen as he watched the Perth side celebrate their own slice of history on the Parkhead turf. A year on and he is part of a Celtic side rapidly closing in on a title that even Derek McInnes, manager of closest challengers Aberdeen, admits is essentially over. While insisting nobody at Celtic is taking league glory for granted, Armstrong – who joined Celtic on transfer deadline day - admits that a title party in the east end of Glasgow next month would represent a green day to banish the blues that still hang over his head from a year ago. ‘Last year’s Scottish Cup Final at Celtic Park was a disappointing end to a very enjoyable season,’ Armstrong recalled ahead of his side's lunchtime clash at Inverness. ‘We had the joy of winning the Scottish Cup semi-final against Rangers at Ibrox so to then go on and lose in the final to St Johnstone was very difficult to take. It’s not something you can change, though, so you have to just live with that disappointment. ‘But winning the title would be nice this year. A bit of success would certainly lighten the disappointment of that cup final. ‘And there’s a nice little gap building now at the top of the table. For a while Aberdeen were threatening us closely but we have managed to extend the gap and we still have a game in hand. While it’s never over until it’s mathematically impossible, we are confident we can clinch it. But we won’t be complacent. Armstrong joined Celtic along with his close friend and former Dundee team-mate Gary Mackay-Steven. ‘I’ve been here at Celtic a few months now and I’ve played a few games so I do feel like a Celtic player. But I would feel even more like a Celtic player with a league winners’ medal. As a player, you want to fill your trophy cabinet up and winning the league title would be a great way to start.’ In this season when achieving just the fourth treble in Celtic’s long history is a real possibility, Armstrong, like close friend Gary Mackay-Steven, has been limited to Premiership action because of his involvement in the cups with United earlier this season. His League Cup-winning team-mates return to Hampden next Sunday to face Inverness in the Scottish Cup semi finals and, while being on the outside for cup ties is undeniably frustrating, Armstrong believes arriving in January has been of huge benefit in other ways. In particular, he feels walking out to a wall of sound at Parkhead against Inter Milan in the Europa League in February will have left himself and Mackay-Steven ready to hit the ground running in the Champions League qualifiers in July. ‘It would be bizarre to maybe only be part of one part of a Treble - but it’s also exciting to be part of a team who are capable of doing it,’ he said. ‘I’d have loved to have been involved in all the big matches but that’s just the way it is. As it is, we have the chance of the title this year – and I’m sure there will be chances for other medals next year. ‘But I definitely feel part of it at Celtic now. Myself and Gary have settled in really well. It was nice people were saying myself and Gary were worthy of being in contention for Scotland but it was nice to get away to Dubai for a few days of sun during the international break and to come back fresh. Even if it felt wrong not having my friend Gary there in Dubai with me, since we’re always together! Kris Commons scored in Celtic's recent Scottish Premiership 2-0 win over Partick Thistle. ‘But being in Dubai to relax let me reflect on everything that’s happened since January. Yes, it’s a little frustrating not to be involved in the cup matches because they are always exciting games. But the advantage of coming in January was that by the time the qualifiers come round next season I will look forward to them rather than be nervous. ‘The Inter Milan game was an eye opener as to how big the support is and how noisy the ground can be. To play against a huge team like them – and for me to do so well – was a great experience and I can’t wait for next season.’ Inverness-born Armstrong played for Caley Thistle for a season as a 16-year-old before his family uprooted for Dundee and he joined up at Tannadice. While he has few ties left in the Highlands, he is full of respect for John Hughes’ side and his friend from the youth team, current Caley Thistle captain Graeme Shinnie. ‘I grew up in Nairn but I was born at Raigmore Hospital,’ he said. ‘We lived up there for six or seven years when I was young and I’ve still got family in Nairn. ‘I also played for Inverness Under 16s for a year before we moved to Dundee. The likes of Graeme Shinnie were there with the Under 19s and Terry Butcher was in charge, with Charlie Christie involved training the youth sides. ‘But I didn’t play particularly well at Inverness. I became a better player after I went to Dundee United.’

Stuart Armstrong is hoping he can win his first Premiership title. Armstrong joined Celtic from Dundee United in January 2015. He experienced heartache during last season's Scottish Cup final. Armstrong and his then Dundee United team-mates were beaten 2-0.

Article: (CNN)Hillary Clinton's campaign-in-waiting met on Saturday in its Brooklyn headquarters, a day before the former secretary of state officially announces her campaign for president, according to a Democrat who attended the meeting. Robby Mook, Clinton's soon-to-be campaign manager, distributed a "values statement" at the meeting that outlined what the campaign will stand for, what their goals are and how they plan to win -- something Clinton failed to do in 2008. The campaign's purpose, the document states, is "to give every family, every small business, and every American a path to lasting prosperity by electing Hillary Clinton the next President of the United States." The document makes clear that the campaign will try to avoid mistakes that plagued Clinton's failed 2008 run. Many of the "guiding principles" in the memo mention issues that sunk Clinton's first campaign. The document, according to the source, includes the ideas from Mook, along with a wide array of Clinton's soon-to-be staffers and advisers. The memo maintains that the campaign must remain humble, disciplined and united, something voters in Iowa and others states have said Clinton did not do in 2008. "This campaign is not about Hillary Clinton and not about us," reads the document that was obtained by CNN. In the section about the campaign's guiding principles, the document reads, "We are humble: We take nothing for granted, we are never afraid to lose, we always outcompete and fight for every vote we can win. We know this campaign will be won on the ground, in states." It also calls on campaign staffers to remain "disciplined" and "open to a diverse range of views." "When we disagree, it's never personal. Once a decision is made, we execute it -- together," reads the memo. "We know there will be tough days, but we will bounce back and get back to work." The document also appears to telegraph the name to Clinton's campaign: "Hillary for America." Clinton is planning to launch her presidential candidacy on Sunday through a video message on social media, according to Democratic sources. Shortly after her announcement, Clinton will travel Iowa and New Hampshire, critical early caucus primary and caucus states.

Article: Daredevil Nik Wallenda says he'll walk untethered on top of a 400-foot observation wheel in Orlando, Florida, this month. Wallenda said Monday at a New York City news conference that the Orlando Eye will be moving when he attempts his feat April 29. The Orlando Eye, part of a new entertainment complex, will offer views of central Florida from inside 30 enclosed, air-conditioned glass capsules when it opens to the public on May 4. Scroll down for video. Eyes on the prize: High-wire performer Nik Wallenda announces his latest stunt at the 400-foot Orlando Eye, during a news conference, in New York on Monday. Tough challenge: The 36-year-old daredevil will walk atop the Orlando Eye as it turns on April 29. The Orlando Eye team issued a statement saying it's excited to have Wallenda attempt the 'amazing stunt.' No distance for the performance has been set yet, but Wallenda, 36, said he was not likely to walk the entire 20 minutes or so that it takes the wheel to go a full circle. Wallenda previously walked atop a Ferris wheel in Santa Cruz, California, but he said the size of the much larger Orlando wheel and the fact that he will not use a pole sets this stunt apart. The seventh-generation member of the 'Flying Wallenda' family of acrobats has walked across the Grand Canyon and Niagara Falls. In November, he walked twice between two Chicago skyscrapers without a net or harness, doing the second walk blindfolded. Wallenda is the great-grandson of Karl Wallenda, who fell to his death in Puerto Rico at 73.

Article: (CNN)No identification, no Social Security card and only a box to live on. John Helinski was homeless and nameless for three years. Suddenly, he's set to buy his own place and collect a nice pension. Helinski hit it big thanks to the Social Security Administration, and a big-hearted cop and a case worker determined to untangle major bureaucracy. Charles Inman could not bear to see his 62-year-old ward land back on the street, he told CNN affiliate WFTS. The shelter where the case worker works set Helinski up with a bunk and a locker. But getting him into the system was hard, because Helinski's ID and Social Security cards had been stolen. "He needed to have an identification, but we couldn't get an identification without a birth certificate," Inman said. A hassle all by itself, except that Helinski was foreign born -- in Poland, as an American citizen. "We first had to figure out that we needed a consular record of foreign birth or something like that," said Tampa police Officer Dan McDonald, who pitched in to help Helinski. With those papers squared away, he and Inman got Helinski a driver's license and a Social Security card. Then, Helinski remembered that he used to have an account with a certain Landmark Bank. "Then it became Bank of America," he said. The account was still there, and the Social Security Administration hadn't forgotten about him. It had kept paying Helinski benefits for years, and they had stacked up high. Now Helinski is thinking of buying his own four walls. And he'll have monthly benefits to live on. "I guess I'm exhilarated, excited, you know," he said. McDonald said he and Inman were stunned. "We weren't quite sure what to say."

Article: Kenny Miller fears Rangers' promotion bid could be derailed by the Ibrox side's rollercoaster run of form. Gers suffered the first defeat of new boss Stuart McCall's six-game reign on Thursday night as they slumped 3-0 at Queen of the South. It was an especially flat display after the high of recent Scottish Championship victories over Hearts and Hibernian. Kenny Miller fears Rangers' promotion bid could be derailed by the Ibrox side's rollercoaster run of form. The Light Blues - who remain behind the Easter Road side in third place on goal difference - now have five games left, starting with Raith on Sunday, to leapfrog Hibs and spare themselves the effort of playing two extra ties in the play-offs. Finish third and they could even be sent back to Palmerston - where they have now lost twice this season - for another testing clash with Queens, provided James Fowler's side see off Falkirk in the race for fourth. But the worry for striker Miller is that Gers' lack of consistency could wreck their chance of a Premiership return. The 35-year-old said: 'Last night was a reminder that we have not turned the corner and that there's a lot of hard work still to be done. Miller (centre) looks dejected as his Rangers side slumped to a 3-0 defeat at Queen of the South. 'It was a performance that summed up out season a little bit. That 'consistency' word has come up a lot this year. 'We seem to have a couple of good performances and then complacency kicks in and we take our foot of the gas. 'If we go back three games to the Hibs result, I don't think anyone could have seen that coming. Fast forward three games and I don't think anyone could have seen the result last night coming. 'We have to nail down that consistency and get to a level of performance that we can pretty much guarantee every week. Rangers had recently secured victories over Scottish Championship rivals Hearts and Hibernian. 'Might this inconsistency come back to haunt us in the play-offs? It could do, yes. 'There is no point winning 1-0 or 2-0 at home and losing 3-0 away - that means you are out. 'It's about getting that level and balance right. We need to get back to where we were at against Hibs and in the first half against Hearts, where I thought we were superb.'

Article: (CNN)A natural gas line explosion at a law enforcement shooting range in Fresno, California, injured 11 people, including some inmates who were on a work detail there. Others being treated include a county road worker and two sheriff's deputies, Fresno County Sheriff Margaret Mims said. The exact cause of Friday's blast is under investigation, Mims said, but it happened at the spot where a county worker was operating a front loader. The explosion sparked a fire that roared like a jet engine, Mims said. The operator of the front loader was injured but able to walk to an ambulance, the sheriff said. The most serious injuries were suffered by a group of inmates who were assigned to maintenance and cleaning work at the sheriff's firing range. There were 10 inmates near the blast site who were also injured, officials said. Three other inmates at the site were not hurt. Earlier, the sheriff's office included them in the injury count. After the blast, Mims said, two sheriff's deputies who were at the firing range ran toward the fire to move the injured. CNN affiliate KFSN posted a video of the scene that shows a tall ball of fire rising from near a highway. One inmate was airlifted to the hospital, the sheriff said. That inmate and the county worker were undergoing emergency surgery, she said. The others suffered mostly burns. The pair of deputies who provided aid also went for treatment for ringing ears and sunburn-like conditions, she said. Firefighters put out the blaze, revealing a crater at the blast site and a blackened front loader, Mims said.

Article: He was, as one ECB board member put it, just too accident-prone for a role that has seen him flounder in the face of the bitter fallout from an Ashes whitewash. Paul Downton was brave enough to make huge decisions in his first 14 months as England’s managing director but the jury is still out on all of them at a time as the clamour for change has grown louder. It was Downton who made the big call to sack Kevin Pietersen and reappoint Peter Moores as England coach. Paul Downton has left his role as managing director of England and Wales Cricket Board. The move came a day ahead of an ECB board meeting that was meant to discuss the future of Downton. OCTOBER 2013. Downton, a former England wicketkeeper, is appointed managing sirector of England and Wales Cricket Board, with his position taking effect from February 1, 2014. FEBRUARY 2014. After the Ashes whitewash, Kevin Pietersen and head coach Andy Flower are sacked. After days of silence, the official line on Pietersen’s dismissal is that the ECB wanted to ‘create a culture’ in which captain Alastair Cook had ‘the full support of all players’. MARCH 2014. England suffer a humiliating 45-run defeat to Holland in the World T20. Ravi Bopara top-scored for England with just 18. APRIL 2014. Downton appoints Peter Moores, who had spent the previous four seasons as head coach at Lancashire, for a second spell as England head coach. MAY 2014. Downton and the ECB issue an apology to Pietersen for claiming he appeared ‘disinterested’ and ‘distracted’ during the fifth Ashes Test in Sydney. JUNE 2014. England lose a Test series at home to Sri Lanka. The south Asian side had previously won on English soil in 1998 — in a one-off Test match. JULY-AUG 2014. England lose the second Test against India, but come back to win the home series 3-1. In the fifth Test, England inflict upon India their third heaviest defeat in history. DECEMBER 2014. Cook is sacked as one-day captain and replaced by Eoin Morgan, marking the end of a sorry year for England in which they won just 18 of their 48 matches across all formats. FEBRUARY-MARCH 2015. England endure a dreadful World Cup campaign, failing to advance from the group stage and finishing behind Bangladesh, who sealed their exit with a 15-run victory. APRIL 2015. Downton departs as ECB managing director. The ECB are to create a new role of ‘director of England Cricket’ ahead of the Ashes series. He also had to back the decision to replace Alastair Cook as one-day captain on the brink of the World Cup even though it was the selectors who drove it. But, most of all, it is England’s humiliating World Cup that led the 14 members of the ECB management board to unanimously back the sacking of Downton when new chief executive Tom Harrison rang them on Wednesday morning. So acute was the embarrassment at England going out in the first round of the World Cup that any hopes Downton had for an extended stay in office proved impossible. To the new regime he had to go. ‘Hugh Morris (his predecessor) stayed in the background but Paul became far too high-profile,’ one board member told Sportsmail on Wednesday night. ‘He was always on the outfield before games. The bottom line is that he was just too accident prone.’ Downton is the most high-profile casualty so far of that new broom sweeping through English cricket, led by Harrison and chairman-elect Colin Graves but he will not be the last, unless England are successful in their busiest of all years. James Whitaker, the national selector, is the most vulnerable, not least because a change of job description for Downton’s successor to director of England cricket looks likely to make the new man an all-round supremo. Moores and captain Alastair Cook now need to beat the West Indies in the three-Test series starting in Antigua on Monday if they are to feel secure. They must then carry on winning when they face New Zealand, Australia, Pakistan and South Africa over the next 10 months in Test cricket alone. Whether this makes a difference to Pietersen’s future remains to be seen. Clearly the removal of the man who sacked him and an ECB chairman Giles Clarke who was firmly against Pietersen must increase the odds on one of the most unlikely comebacks in sport history happening this summer. Much may depend on who replaces Downton because there is still no real appetite within the ECB, and certainly not among senior members of the England team, for Pietersen to return. His best chance may be if Michael Vaughan is appointed by a man he is known to be close to in Graves. The former England captain  said on Wednesday that he would like to talk to the ECB about the role. Vaughan was the England captain who brought the best from Pietersen, admittedly when he was young and far less likely to cause trouble, and has made no secret of his encouragement for his return. Yet Vaughan, a constant critic of Downton and Moores, has a myriad of interests, both cricketing and otherwise, that he presumably must shelve if he is to return to the ECB now. A more likely scenario is for another former England captain in Andrew Strauss to take up a role that would appear made for him. There were many at the ECB who wanted Strauss to succeed Morris, not least the Welshman himself, but he ruled it out at the time, saying it was too soon after the end of his playing career. Since then he has dabbled in commentary with Sky but may now think the time is right for what seems a natural progression to administration. Downton's job description has been abolished as a result following England's dismal World Cup showing. Downton leaves his role as ECB managing director following England's shameful performance at World Cup. Former England captain Michael Vaughan  said on Wednesday he would like to talk to the ECB about the role. Kevin Pietersen (left) could return for England while Andrew Strauss (right) is another that could take the role. Pietersen was uncharacteristically coy when asked on Twitter for his thoughts on Downton’s departure. Alec Stewart is another candidate who, presumably, would have a more open mind about recalling Pietersen as he has just re-signed him for Surrey. He is the third man on the most likely three-man short-list. The best brains in English cricket are undoubtedly Hussain and Atherton so Harrison and Graves should be doing all they possibly can to encourage one of them to return to the national cause. Hussain has already refused and it is extremely unlikely Atherton would be tempted either. Downton has become a derided character but he does not deserve to be the figure of ridicule he has become as frustration has grown at the national team. He was a respected wicketkeeper-batsman with England who had to play much of his Test cricket against the West Indies at their peak and was widely admired for his bravery and gutsy character. His return to cricket after a career in the City came at a time when Morris assured him that everything was in place for a bright future. England’s catastrophic collapse in Australia changed everything. The decision to ditch Pietersen was, as far as I am concerned, absolutely right while Moores may yet prove to be the coach Downton and others believe him to be. But a fall-guy was needed for the World Cup and Downton was the obvious candidate. It remains to be seen how many follow.

Downton speaks with Sir Ian Botham  at Lord's Cricket Ground on May 31, 2014. Meanwhile, here in Basseterre, Jonny Bairstow picked a bad day to remind England that he is a player of real potential despite being jettisoned after the winter’s Ashes disaster. England’s decision to turn their second warm-up game into a practice session saw Bairstow, Jonathan Trott, Gary Ballance and Joe Root bat for an extremely weak St Kitts Invitational XI against their own team. Trott fell third ball to Jimmy Anderson, fending a ball outside off stump to third slip, while Ballance still looked out of touch in being dismissed for 17. Yet Bairstow, the back-up keeper on this tour, made the most of his chance to score 98 before falling to the impressive Ben Stokes. There was an early worry when Stuart Broad slipped in his delivery stride and fell clutching his ankle. He went off for treatment but later returned to bowl and looked no worse for the accident. Root was also struck flush on the helmet fielding at short leg but came out later to bat for St Kitts. England will bat for the whole of Thursday before leaving for Monday’s first Test in Antigua. Alastair Cook. Downton was a supporter of Cook as Test captain but was persuaded to sack him as one-day captain three weeks before the disastrous World Cup campaign. The new ‘Director of England cricket’ might think Cook needs to go back to scoring runs at the top of the order after failing to convince as a tactician. Verdict: Vulnerable. Alastair Cook was suppoerted by Downton before being sacked as one-day captain before the World Cup. James Whitaker. The chairman of selectors and former Leicestershire captain has been involved in one of the grimmest periods in English cricket. Selections have been difficult to fathom at times and a series of well-publicised clangers have alienated the selector from players, spectators and media. Verdict: Sure to follow Downton out the door. England selector James Whitaker (left) and former managing director Downton during a nets session. Peter Moores. An atrocious World Cup heaped even more pressure on the coach, whose reappointment last year by Downton has been mitigated only by last summer’s Test series win against India. Described as ‘the outstanding coach of his generation’ by Downton, Moores’ position is now as weak as it has been. Verdict: Vulnerable. Peter Moores’ position is now as weak as it has been following Downton's dismissal at the ECB. Kevin Pietersen. It is almost inconceivable that barely six months after publishing one of the most vitriolic books in the history of sport, this high-maintenance player could be on the brink of a return. But Downton’s removal, and Giles Clarke’s departure, means the path is now clear for Pietersen if he scores runs for Surrey. Verdict: Return possible. Kevin Pietersen's path is now clear to return if he scores runs for Surrey and he tweeted just as much.

Paul Downton was swept aside as managing director on Wednesday. Downton lost his job following a woeful 2015 World Cup performance. The 58-year-old's job description has been abolished as a result.

Article: (CNN)For Lt. Colonel John Schwemmer, the scenery is all too familiar. This is his sixth tour in Iraq, and he's back doing a job that he's been tasked with before: training Iraqi soldiers. Schwemmer and other active U.S. military personnel are on the ground in Iraq, whipping often ill-equipped government troops into shape. They've been here before, but this time, he feels, they're getting it right. But the U.S. military isn't the only contingent of Western forces in the region -- dozens of foreigners, including Americans, have volunteered to take the fight to ISIS. And increasingly, U.S. military training efforts are being supplemented by outside agencies, who are working with Kurdish government troops and even militia in Iraq and Syria. "Many of us do feel that we do have the skills and qualifications that can be used to benefit those in the region," said Ian Bradbury, a Canadian former soldier who is training Kurdish Peshmerga forces in northern Iraq. While it is difficult to say how many foreign volunteers are fighting ISIS, a spokesman for a Kurdish militia fighting against them in Syria -- known as the YPG -- told the New York Times their forces include more than 100 American citizens. U.S. law enforcement officials say it is illegal to join a Syrian militia. But some organizations have set up recruitment drives online, featuring applications for foreign fighters complete with checklists of what to bring and advice on bringing body armor across international borders. Jordan Matson, a 28-year-old former U.S. army soldier from the tiny town of Sturtevant, Wisconsin, volunteered with the YPG. He told CNN that after much soul searching he realized that he needed to help in the battle against ISIS' brutal, expansionist regime. "I got in contact with the YPG on Facebook and prayed about it for probably a month or two and asked, 'is this what I want to do?' and eventually, you know, decided to do it. "All my life I wanted to be a solider... so I guess this just fits well over here." But foreign fighters aren't universally welcomed by those opposing ISIS. The Peshmerga, the military wing of the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) that has been one of the most effective counterbalances to ISIS' expansion, has said they don't want or need foreign fighters, according to Bradbury. "The information I've been getting back is that there's very little use for (Western fighters) on the front lines, especially on the KRG side -- they have significant numbers of personnel -- it's a source of Kurdish pride for them to rise up in scenarios like this. They more need the development assistance." Peshmerga spokesman Helgurd Hekmat also told Kurdish news wire Rudaw that it was illegal for foreigners to join their ranks. While individual fighters are not always accepted, volunteers working as military trainers are sharing their expertise to support those on the front lines of the fight against ISIS forces. Bradbury set up 1st North American Expeditionary Forces (1st NAEF), a training body which, he says, is currently providing material support and training to the Peshmerga, whose name means "those who face death," in northern Iraq. "Internal capacity building is by far the solution that you can put into a region that is suffering instability from conflict," he told CNN by phone from his base in Ottawa, Canada. "Increasing their ability to maintain stability over the long term is far better than trying to influx it with a bunch of westerners who are going to leave within a short period of time." He was prompted to establish the group after seeing "fairly significant gaps" in the support provided by the coalition forces for the Kurdish, Iraqi regular and militia ranged against ISIS. The U.S. military is "confident" that its support of the forces battling ISIS on the ground is sufficient. "We're confident the U.S. military mission of degrading and ultimately defeating (ISIS) will be found by working through our Middle Eastern partners and the international community," Maj. Omar Villarreal, Communication Integration Planner, U.S. Central Command Communication Integration Directorate, told CNN. "The training element of the mission is no different. It relies on direct and comprehensive military cooperation with regional partner nations, who share a mutual interest in promoting security. One of the goals of the train and equip program, is to build the capabilities of the moderate Syrian fighters to defend the Syrian people. We are confident in our efforts." With coalition members keen to distance themselves from calls for Western boots on the ground -- and little political appetite from overseas for risking Western troops in what many see as a sectarian conflict, Bradbury contends that the best-case scenario is exactly the kind of logistical support that organizations like 1st NAEF are providing. ISIS is keen to play up religious and sectarian divisions in order to create the perception that they are the Sunni protectors of a persecuted underclass, sending non-Arab troops into the battlefield -- even in a support role -- could play into that divisive rhetoric. Bradbury downplays this risk, saying the threat is there, and is best contained in the region. Providing noncombat backing, such as medical, weaponry, logistical and training assistance would appear, he thinks, to be the best way of supporting those Kurdish and Arab troops on the front. "Regardless of perceptions of any kind of us-against-them scenario, it absolutely is a world-against-ISIS issue that needs to take place and there definitely needs to be a global response," he said.

Article: He was, as one ECB board member put it, just too accident-prone for a role that has seen him flounder in the face of the bitter fallout from an Ashes whitewash. Paul Downton was brave enough to make huge decisions in his first 14 months as England’s managing director but the jury is still out on all of them at a time as the clamour for change has grown louder. It was Downton who made the big call to sack Kevin Pietersen and reappoint Peter Moores as England coach. Paul Downton has left his role as managing director of England and Wales Cricket Board. The move came a day ahead of an ECB board meeting that was meant to discuss the future of Downton. OCTOBER 2013. Downton, a former England wicketkeeper, is appointed managing sirector of England and Wales Cricket Board, with his position taking effect from February 1, 2014. FEBRUARY 2014. After the Ashes whitewash, Kevin Pietersen and head coach Andy Flower are sacked. After days of silence, the official line on Pietersen’s dismissal is that the ECB wanted to ‘create a culture’ in which captain Alastair Cook had ‘the full support of all players’. MARCH 2014. England suffer a humiliating 45-run defeat to Holland in the World T20. Ravi Bopara top-scored for England with just 18. APRIL 2014. Downton appoints Peter Moores, who had spent the previous four seasons as head coach at Lancashire, for a second spell as England head coach. MAY 2014. Downton and the ECB issue an apology to Pietersen for claiming he appeared ‘disinterested’ and ‘distracted’ during the fifth Ashes Test in Sydney. JUNE 2014. England lose a Test series at home to Sri Lanka. The south Asian side had previously won on English soil in 1998 — in a one-off Test match. JULY-AUG 2014. England lose the second Test against India, but come back to win the home series 3-1. In the fifth Test, England inflict upon India their third heaviest defeat in history. DECEMBER 2014. Cook is sacked as one-day captain and replaced by Eoin Morgan, marking the end of a sorry year for England in which they won just 18 of their 48 matches across all formats. FEBRUARY-MARCH 2015. England endure a dreadful World Cup campaign, failing to advance from the group stage and finishing behind Bangladesh, who sealed their exit with a 15-run victory. APRIL 2015. Downton departs as ECB managing director. The ECB are to create a new role of ‘director of England Cricket’ ahead of the Ashes series. He also had to back the decision to replace Alastair Cook as one-day captain on the brink of the World Cup even though it was the selectors who drove it. But, most of all, it is England’s humiliating World Cup that led the 14 members of the ECB management board to unanimously back the sacking of Downton when new chief executive Tom Harrison rang them on Wednesday morning. So acute was the embarrassment at England going out in the first round of the World Cup that any hopes Downton had for an extended stay in office proved impossible. To the new regime he had to go. ‘Hugh Morris (his predecessor) stayed in the background but Paul became far too high-profile,’ one board member told Sportsmail on Wednesday night. ‘He was always on the outfield before games. The bottom line is that he was just too accident prone.’ Downton is the most high-profile casualty so far of that new broom sweeping through English cricket, led by Harrison and chairman-elect Colin Graves but he will not be the last, unless England are successful in their busiest of all years. James Whitaker, the national selector, is the most vulnerable, not least because a change of job description for Downton’s successor to director of England cricket looks likely to make the new man an all-round supremo. Moores and captain Alastair Cook now need to beat the West Indies in the three-Test series starting in Antigua on Monday if they are to feel secure. They must then carry on winning when they face New Zealand, Australia, Pakistan and South Africa over the next 10 months in Test cricket alone. Whether this makes a difference to Pietersen’s future remains to be seen. Clearly the removal of the man who sacked him and an ECB chairman Giles Clarke who was firmly against Pietersen must increase the odds on one of the most unlikely comebacks in sport history happening this summer. Much may depend on who replaces Downton because there is still no real appetite within the ECB, and certainly not among senior members of the England team, for Pietersen to return. His best chance may be if Michael Vaughan is appointed by a man he is known to be close to in Graves. The former England captain  said on Wednesday that he would like to talk to the ECB about the role. Vaughan was the England captain who brought the best from Pietersen, admittedly when he was young and far less likely to cause trouble, and has made no secret of his encouragement for his return. Yet Vaughan, a constant critic of Downton and Moores, has a myriad of interests, both cricketing and otherwise, that he presumably must shelve if he is to return to the ECB now. A more likely scenario is for another former England captain in Andrew Strauss to take up a role that would appear made for him. There were many at the ECB who wanted Strauss to succeed Morris, not least the Welshman himself, but he ruled it out at the time, saying it was too soon after the end of his playing career. Since then he has dabbled in commentary with Sky but may now think the time is right for what seems a natural progression to administration. Downton's job description has been abolished as a result following England's dismal World Cup showing. Downton leaves his role as ECB managing director following England's shameful performance at World Cup. Former England captain Michael Vaughan  said on Wednesday he would like to talk to the ECB about the role. Kevin Pietersen (left) could return for England while Andrew Strauss (right) is another that could take the role. Pietersen was uncharacteristically coy when asked on Twitter for his thoughts on Downton’s departure. Alec Stewart is another candidate who, presumably, would have a more open mind about recalling Pietersen as he has just re-signed him for Surrey. He is the third man on the most likely three-man short-list. The best brains in English cricket are undoubtedly Hussain and Atherton so Harrison and Graves should be doing all they possibly can to encourage one of them to return to the national cause. Hussain has already refused and it is extremely unlikely Atherton would be tempted either. Downton has become a derided character but he does not deserve to be the figure of ridicule he has become as frustration has grown at the national team. He was a respected wicketkeeper-batsman with England who had to play much of his Test cricket against the West Indies at their peak and was widely admired for his bravery and gutsy character. His return to cricket after a career in the City came at a time when Morris assured him that everything was in place for a bright future. England’s catastrophic collapse in Australia changed everything. The decision to ditch Pietersen was, as far as I am concerned, absolutely right while Moores may yet prove to be the coach Downton and others believe him to be. But a fall-guy was needed for the World Cup and Downton was the obvious candidate. It remains to be seen how many follow.

Downton speaks with Sir Ian Botham  at Lord's Cricket Ground on May 31, 2014. Meanwhile, here in Basseterre, Jonny Bairstow picked a bad day to remind England that he is a player of real potential despite being jettisoned after the winter’s Ashes disaster. England’s decision to turn their second warm-up game into a practice session saw Bairstow, Jonathan Trott, Gary Ballance and Joe Root bat for an extremely weak St Kitts Invitational XI against their own team. Trott fell third ball to Jimmy Anderson, fending a ball outside off stump to third slip, while Ballance still looked out of touch in being dismissed for 17. Yet Bairstow, the back-up keeper on this tour, made the most of his chance to score 98 before falling to the impressive Ben Stokes. There was an early worry when Stuart Broad slipped in his delivery stride and fell clutching his ankle. He went off for treatment but later returned to bowl and looked no worse for the accident. Root was also struck flush on the helmet fielding at short leg but came out later to bat for St Kitts. England will bat for the whole of Thursday before leaving for Monday’s first Test in Antigua. Alastair Cook. Downton was a supporter of Cook as Test captain but was persuaded to sack him as one-day captain three weeks before the disastrous World Cup campaign. The new ‘Director of England cricket’ might think Cook needs to go back to scoring runs at the top of the order after failing to convince as a tactician. Verdict: Vulnerable. Alastair Cook was suppoerted by Downton before being sacked as one-day captain before the World Cup. James Whitaker. The chairman of selectors and former Leicestershire captain has been involved in one of the grimmest periods in English cricket. Selections have been difficult to fathom at times and a series of well-publicised clangers have alienated the selector from players, spectators and media. Verdict: Sure to follow Downton out the door. England selector James Whitaker (left) and former managing director Downton during a nets session. Peter Moores. An atrocious World Cup heaped even more pressure on the coach, whose reappointment last year by Downton has been mitigated only by last summer’s Test series win against India. Described as ‘the outstanding coach of his generation’ by Downton, Moores’ position is now as weak as it has been. Verdict: Vulnerable. Peter Moores’ position is now as weak as it has been following Downton's dismissal at the ECB. Kevin Pietersen. It is almost inconceivable that barely six months after publishing one of the most vitriolic books in the history of sport, this high-maintenance player could be on the brink of a return. But Downton’s removal, and Giles Clarke’s departure, means the path is now clear for Pietersen if he scores runs for Surrey. Verdict: Return possible. Kevin Pietersen's path is now clear to return if he scores runs for Surrey and he tweeted just as much.

Paul Downton was swept aside as managing director on Wednesday. Downton lost his job following a woeful 2015 World Cup performance. The 58-year-old's job description has been abolished as a result.

Article: (CNN)It would be easy to laugh off Vin Diesel's prediction that his film "Furious 7" will win an Oscar next year, but not for the reason you might think. After all, the actor was serious when he recently told Variety "It will probably win best picture at the Oscars, unless the Oscars don't want to be relevant ever." But rather than ignore it because it's a glossy, blockbuster action film, some might argue that the movie goes against type for Academy Award nominated films because the cast is so diverse. "Furious 7" hits theaters Friday, months after controversy was stirred about the lack of diversity at the Oscars. There were no actors of color nominated and no women in the directing category, which was dominated by white males. Mexican filmmaker Alejandro Gonzalez Iñarritu went on to win best director for "Birdman." The lack of diversity was so glaring (even with the mostly black cast of the movie "Selma," which received a nomination for best picture) that it spurred the Twitter hashtag "#OscarsSoWhite." In contrast, "Furious 7" couldn't be more racially and ethnically inclusive. The cast includes Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson -- a Samoan/black man -- black actors Christopher "Ludacris" Bridges and Tyrese Gibson, Hispanic performer Michelle Rodriguez, Thai martial artist Tony Jaa, Beninese expatriate Djimon Hounsou and the late Paul Walker, a blue-eyed, blond-haired California native. The filmmakers even went so far as to make sure casting directors in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, where key scenes were filmed, found diverse extras. "We were mainly looking for the diverse look of the (United Arab Emirates)," Miranda Davidson, owner of the casting company, told The National. "They really wanted to make sure we reflected the international feel of the country." Almost since the beginning, the "Fast and Furious" films have had a diverse focus and appeal.  The band of street racers, which encompassed white, black, Asian, Hispanic, male and female and bond as a family, has done well at the box office with each iteration. In 2011, then Boston Globe film critic Wesley Morris wrote, "Go on and laugh your Benetton, Kumbaya, Kashi, quinoa laugh, but it's true: The most progressive force in Hollywood today is the 'Fast and Furious' movies." "They're loud, ludicrous, and visually incoherent," he said. "They're also the last bunch of movies you'd expect to see in the same sentence as 'incredibly important.' But they are -- if only because they feature race as a fact of life as opposed to a social problem or an occasion for self-congratulation. (And this doesn't even account for the gay tension between the male leads, and the occasional crypto-lesbian make-out.)" According to the Motion Picture Association of America's 2014 Theatrical Market Statistics Report, while Hispanics make up 17% of the U.S. population they account for 25% of frequent moviegoers. Likewise, women make up 52% of moviegoers. Entertainment Weekly points out that the film franchise is doing a much better job of reflecting its audience than others in Hollywood. "Despite the films' cumulative worldwide gross of almost $2.4 billion, their racial inclusiveness remains an outlier; American movies are still overwhelmingly white," EW's Chris Lee writes. "According to UCLA's 2015 Hollywood Diversity Report, a mere 16.7% of 2013 films starred minorities in lead roles." At least one moviegoer tweeted that he appreciated the effort. Diesel told EW the franchise has come a long way from the original 2001 film, which featured segregated gangs of racers pitted against each other. "It doesn't matter what nationality you are," the star said. "As a member of the audience, you realize you can be a member of that 'family.' That's the beautiful thing about how the franchise has evolved."

Ms Moric, pictured, reassured her many fans she only needed some time to recover from her fall. She was once married to famous paparazzi snapper Fabrizio Corona, 41, who ended up in jail and the pair have a son together, Carlos Maria, who was born in 2002. Corona, the 'king' of Italy's paparazzi, was jailed for blackmailing celebs with compromising photographs. Corona's scoops helped fuel the celebrity TV culture driven by former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's channels and publications. He claimed he never blackmailed celebrities he snapped, merely offering them first option to buy the photos at the rate he would have sold them to publications. But police tapping his phone during an investigation heard him tell his then wife Nina: 'Yes, it's true, I ruin lives, I am a piece of s*** and I don't even feel guilty any more.'

Article: (CNN)A measles outbreak that affected more than 130 Californians since December is over, the California Department of Public Health declared Friday. It has been 42 days since the last known case of B3 strain of measles, the equivalent of two successive incubation periods, said Dr. Karen Smith, director of the health department. The department said in its latest update that 131 people came down with the B3 strain, and five who had a different genotype than the outbreak strain. Of the 131 cases, the state was able to obtain the vaccination status for 81 patients. Of the 81, 70% were unvaccinated. "Prompt investigation of cases, interviewing hundreds of contacts of infected people, vaccinating hundreds of at risk people, and increasing awareness among health care providers about measles, helped to control this outbreak," Smith said. The outbreak began with dozens of visitors to two Disney theme parks in the state. The health department said 42 of the cases occurred from December 17-20. Two patients with rashes have been identified in April, but they have a different measles genotype. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on its website that 19 different strains have been discovered since 1990. Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease. It causes fever, red and sore eyes, runny nose, cough and a rash. It can cause deadly health complications, including pneumonia and encephalitis. It  is spread by contact with an infected person through coughing or sneezing. It can remain in the air and on surfaces for up to two hours. CNN's Debra Goldschmidt contributed to this report.

Article: (CNN)As thousands of South Africans took to the streets of the city of Durban to rally against violence and xenophobia, an online community has joined the protests. The marches follow recent violent attacks on foreigners in the country that have claimed five lives. During the protest march Thursday, Twitter followers voiced their support through hashtag campaigns. #PeaceMarch and #SayNoToXenophobia were some of the most popular. South African Police Services said more than 10,000 people attended the march, including civil rights groups and nongovernmental organizations. Hashtags are now pouring out of South Africa. But many are asking, some via Twitter, is it enough to fight #xenophobia? Attacks this week in Durban alone have killed two immigrants and three South Africans, including a 14-year-old boy, authorities said. For South African Tim Flack, tweeting wasn't going to make a bit of difference. Flack, who lives in Cape Town, has brought allegations of hate speech and human rights violations against Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini, who he said referred to foreigners as "lice" and has said "they should pack their bags and go." "People listen to him," Flack said. "He is a monarch. The Zulu people in South Africa take him very seriously, they don't question what he says." Flack said he was motivated to make the allegations after seeing multiple complaints about xenophobic violence on social media and thinking they weren't enough. So he filed a complaint with the South African Human Rights Commission, and then tweeted about it. "The activists sit around feeling accomplished because they retweeted five times," Flack said. "I want to reach people who see that they can lay a charge and it won't cost them anything, but I will have done something to change the country and push it into a better state of being." Now, the Human Rights Commission must decide whether to investigate Flack's allegations against the King, who denies fueling any violence. Flack hopes others will also make complaints. Flack added that Zulus aren't the only people in South Africa who share in the xenophobic sentiment. "People are frustrated and unemployed, and people in South Africa pay foreign nationals a lot less," he said of the tension between nationals and immigrants. "A domestic worker would ask for 250 rand a day to clean a house, whereas a foreign national would ask for 150 rand, so it causes resentment." Imtiaz Sooliman, founder and chairman of the Gift of Givers Foundation in Durban, doesn't think most South Africans are against foreigners. "South Africans are against xenophobia," said Sooliman, who insists the majority of the country is providing an overwhelming amount of support for foreign nationals. Gift of Givers has been administering assistance at five refugee camps set up by the South African government that now hold roughly 8,000 foreign national refugees, he said, passing out things like clothing and hygiene packs. The organization posts its work at the camps online and tags it on social media with #xenophobia. Why? "In South Africa, everyone knows xenophobia," Sooliman said, "and the way a disaster agency works is we post what people understand. So if you say #tsunami or #war, people follow it. So here, people say #xenophobia, and they all know what it is -- it is a disaster, so you are going to post what people understand." He said South Africans also have been going to the camps, which are on sports fields with makeshift tents, bringing cooked food and other necessities. "This is different from what happened in 2008," Sooliman said. That year, scores were killed in attacks in the poorest areas of Johannesburg. Most of the victims were Zimbabweans who had fled repression and dire economic circumstances. Sooliman said that along with the government strongly condemning the violence, community engagement is happening now as it never happened before. It is a kind of national unity that can be best summed up with another hashtag that has emerged from this story: #WeAreAfrica. Only time, or, tweets will tell if it works.

Article: Chelsea captain John Terry has revealed his picks for the PFA Player and Team of the Year with Liverpool playmaker Philippe Coutinho getting his nod as the Premier League's finest. Although the former England captain has not been on the losing side to Liverpool in three games this season, Terry has obviously been impressed by the young Brazilian's skills - despite him only scoring four league goals. Less surprising is Terry's choice of Tottenham scoring sensation Harry Kane as Young Player of the Year- with the 21-year-old's rise from obscurity to scoring 19 league goals for Spurs making him almost certain to  take home the award. Chelsea captain John Terry revealed his PFA Team of the Year on Instagram. The Blues legend named Phillipe Coutinho as his Player of the Year and Harry Kane as his Young Player. Liverpool's Brazilian playmaker, scoring the winner in the FA Cup, has hit form in second half of the season. Keeper: David de Gea. Defenders: Ryan Bertrand, Jose Fonte, Laurent Koscielny, Nathanial Clyne. Midfielders: Philippe Coutinho, Raheem Sterling, Juan Mata, Sadio mane. Strikers: Harry Kane, Sergio Aguero. As a defender, Terry has acknowledged Southampton's miserly record this season by including no less than three of their backline - Jose Fonte, Nathaniel Clyne and former Chelsea full-back Ryan Bertrand who left Stamford Bridge for St Mary's in the summer. Manchester United's outstanding keeper David de Gea and Arsenal centre-back Laurent Koscielny complete Terry's defence. In midfield, Coutinho is joined by Raheem Sterling, Sadio Mane and another player former Blue Juan Mata who has endured a difficult time under Louis van Gaal before making his mark at Old Trafford. Despite not finding the net in his last five league games, Sergio Aguero takes his place alongside Kane in Terry's attack in a classic 'big man/small man' combination. Kane has scored 19 league goals, although he was mistakenly named best player by Youssouf Mulumbu. Former Chelsea stars Juan Mata (left) and Ryan Bertrand (right) were also named in Terry's XI. Meanwhile, West Brom midfielder Youssouf Mulumbu was left red-faced after posting his own PFA Team of the Year selections on Twitter - only to realise he had got his Players of the Year mixed up. The Baggies star had named Kane as Player of the Year and Chelsea's Eden Hazard as Young Player of the Year before later realising his mistake and tweeting:  ‘I get it wrong Hazard player of the year And young player Kane!!’

Article: New York (CNN)A suburban New York cardiologist has been charged in connection with a failed scheme to have another physician hurt or killed, according to prosecutors. Dr. Anthony Moschetto, 54, pleaded not guilty Wednesday to criminal solicitation, conspiracy, burglary, arson, criminal prescription sale and weapons charges in connection to what prosecutors called a plot to take out a rival doctor on Long Island. He was released after posting $2 million bond and surrendering his passport. Two other men -- identified as James Chmela, 43, and James Kalamaras, 41 -- were named as accomplices, according to prosecutors. They pleaded not guilty in Nassau County District Court, according to authorities. Both were released on bail. Requests for comment from attorneys representing Moschetto and Chmela were not returned.  It's unclear whether Kalamaras has retained an attorney. Moschetto's attorney, Randy Zelin, said Wednesday that his client "will be defending himself vigorously," the New York Post reported. "Doctors are supposed to ensure the health and wellbeing of people, but Dr. Moschetto is alleged to have replaced that responsibility with brazen, callous and criminal acts," Acting Nassau District Attorney Madeline Singas said in a statement. Police officers allegedly discovered approximately 100 weapons at Moschetto's home, including hand grenades, high-capacity magazines and knives. Many of the weapons were found in a hidden room behind a switch-activated bookshelf, according to prosecutors. The investigation began back in December, when undercover officers began buying heroin and oxycodone pills from Moschetto in what was initially a routine investigation into the sale of prescription drugs, officials said. During the course of the undercover operation, however, Moschetto also sold the officers two semiautomatic assault weapons as well as ammunition, prosecutors said. Moschetto allegedly told officers during one buy that he needed dynamite to "blow up a building." He later said he no longer needed the dynamite because a friend was setting fire to the building instead. Kalamaras and Chmela are believed to have taken part in the arson, according to prosecutors. "The fire damaged but did not destroy the office of another cardiologist whose relationship with Dr. Moschetto had soured due to a professional dispute," according to the statement from the district attorney's office. Moschetto allegedly gave an informant and undercover detective blank prescriptions and cash for the assault and killing of the fellow cardiologist, according to prosecutors. He also requested that the rival's wife be assaulted if she happened to be present, authorities said. "He was willing to pay $5,000 to have him beaten and put in a hospital for a few months, and then he said he would pay $20,000 to have him killed," said Assistant District Attorney Anne Donnelly, reported CNN affiliate WCBS.

Here is all the information you need for Liverpool's home clash with Newcastle... Liverpool vs Newcastle United (Anfield) Team news. Liverpool. Liverpool defender Mamadou Sakho will miss Monday's visit of Newcastle with a hamstring injury. The France international came off in the first half of Wednesday's FA Cup win over Blackburn but his absence will be lessened by the return from suspension of Emre Can, although Martin Skrtel and Steven Gerrard must serve the final match of their three-game bans. Mamadou Sakho (right) was forced off injured against Blackburn Rovers in Wednesday's FA Cup replay. Striker Daniel Sturridge should be fit after complaining of muscle tightness while manager Brendan Rodgers will wait to see if Mario Balotelli has recovered from illness. Provisional squad: Mignolet, Johnson, Can, Lovren, Moreno, Henderson, Lucas, Allen, Sterling, Coutinho, Sturridge, Jones, Toure, Enrique, Manquillo, Markovic, Brannagan, Lambert, Borini, Balotelli. Newcastle. Newcastle defender Daryl Janmaat should be fit to take his place in the team for Monday night's Barclays Premier League trip to Liverpool despite an injury scare. The full-back, who has been playing in central defence because of skipper Fabricio Coloccini's suspension, suffered a suspected tear to a calf muscle during the warm-up at Sunderland on Sunday, but managed to play the full 90 minutes and appears to have suffered no lasting ill-effects. Daryl Janmaat trains with Newcastle United in a running session on Tuesday. Coloccini will complete his three-match ban and striker Papiss Cisse sits out the fourth of his seven matches, but while midfielders Rolando Aarons (hamstring) and Siem de Jong (collapsed lung) have returned to training, neither will be involved at Anfield. Provisional squad: Krul, Elliot, Janmaat, Williamson, R Taylor, Satka, Sterry, Abeid, Anita, Colback, Sissoko, Gouffran, Cabella, Ameobi, Obertan, Gutierrez, Kemen, Riviere, Perez, Armstrong.

Article: (CNN)The U.N. Security Council voted Tuesday in favor of an arms embargo on Houthis -- the minority group that has taken over large swaths of Yemen, including its capital, Sanaa -- and supporters of former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh. The resolution "raises the cost" for the Houthis, according to Mark Lyall Grant, Britain's ambassador to the United Nations. In addition to the arms embargo, it also demands that the Shiite group pull back and refrain from more violence and includes sanctions aimed at controlling the spread of terrorism, according to Grant. Russia abstained from Tuesday's vote, saying it didn't like the inclusion of sanctions. In recent weeks, Saudi Arabia has led a coalition that is conducting airstrikes on targets associated with Saleh's supporters and the Houthis, who have emerged as Yemen's most dominant force in recent months. Also Tuesday, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Saudi Arabian Minister of Defense Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz agreed to form a joint military commission to discuss the implementation of a major strategic maneuver inside Saudi Arabia, Egypt's state-run Ahram news agency reported. Egypt announced that it would dispatch several naval ships to help halt the rebels' advance. In response to media reports, Egyptian officials said no troops have yet been sent to Yemen. The Houthis forced President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi from power in January, though Hadi still claims he is Yemen's legitimate leader and is working with the Saudis and other allies to return to Yemen. Those allied with Hadi have accused the Iranian government of supporting the Houthis in their uprising in Yemen. They include Yemen's current ambassador to the United Nations, Khaled Mahfoodh Abdulla Bahah, who said Tuesday, "We refuse (the) influence of Iran in Yemen affairs." CNN's Richard Roth and Dominique Dodley reported from New York, and CNN's Greg Botelho wrote this report from Atlanta. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz contributed to this report.

Article: (CNN)From late January, when New England was living through one of its bleakest and snowiest winters, to a warm and sunny afternoon in April, the jurors in the first-degree murder trial of former NFL star Aaron Hernandez have considered how a promising young athlete who earned millions came to take the life of his onetime friend and future brother-in-law, Odin Lloyd. The jury of seven women and five men listened to more than 130 witnesses and reviewed more than 400 pieces of evidence over the months-long trial. On Wednesday, they convicted Hernandez, who was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, after deliberating more than 35 hours over parts of seven days. After the verdict, jurors agreed to meet with reporters, at times laughing nervously while shedding light on what some described as the grueling deliberation process. Here are five things to know about what they said:. While declining to discuss specifics of what happened in the jury room, jurors said they came away satisfied with their decision. "It's a very big decision to make, and every one of us... made sure we came to the best conclusion," one juror told reporters. At one point on Monday, jurors asked Judge Susan Garsh to allow smoking breaks, which were permitted during trial. Some observers thought this signaled weeks of deliberations. A male juror said some panel members had meticulously filled four to eight notebooks as they listened to testimony. "It was hard... for everyone," said a woman on the jury. "Everyone's life changed because of this." Asked to elaborate, she told a reporter, "I've been here for as long as you have." "It's the hardest thing I've ever done in my life," she said later about serving on the jury. "Absolutely, by far." Asked whether they would say anything to Hernandez, one of the women on the panel said simply, "Nothing." Others nodded in apparent agreement. Do they have any feelings about the 25-year-old former star? "For me, Judge Garsh said, 'Keep your mind suspended,' " said a female juror. "We went in there every day with open minds. We listened to the evidence. We heard what they had to say. We got to go into a room and see and touch and feel all the evidence and that's when we came to our conclusion." Did they know anything about Hernandez or the case before the trial? One juror responded: "Nothing." "Very little," said another. About six jurors raised their hands when asked who among them was a New England Patriots fan. The jurors said they found out about Hernandez's other legal woes from Garsh only after they reached a verdict. Hernandez potentially faces three more trials, one criminal and two civil actions. Next up is another murder trial in which he is accused of killing two men and wounding another person near a Boston nightclub in July 2012. Prosecutors have said Hernandez fatally shot Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado when he fired into their 2003 BMW. Another passenger was wounded and two others were uninjured. Hernandez pleaded not guilty at his arraignment. The families of de Abreu and Furtado filed civil suits against Hernandez, and a judge froze his $5 million in assets, pending the outcome of the double-murder trial. The freeze includes the disputed $3.3 million signing bonus payment Hernandez claims he is owed by the New England Patriots. Hernandez is also being sued by a man who claims Hernandez shot him while they were in a limousine in Miami in February 2013. Alexander Bradley claims Hernandez wounded him after the two got into a fight at a Miami strip club. "It's amazing a lot of the information we learned today," a female juror said Wednesday. "I think we can all say we made the right decision." Some jurors admitted to not knowing who Patriots owner Robert Kraft was when he took the stand at the trial. But they agreed that Kraft's testimony was crucial. Kraft testified that Hernandez proclaimed his innocence to him and told the team owner that "he hoped that the time of the murder... came out because I believe he said he was in a club." "To this day -- we just went through a three-month trial, and this is now two years later -- we still don't know the exact time of Odin's murder," a male juror said. "So I don't know how Aaron would have had that information two years ago." Another juror was struck by the emotional testimony of Lloyd's family and friends. "For me, it was in the beginning -- the pictures," a woman said of autopsy photos of Lloyd's bullet-riddled body. "You're told to be unemotional and to sit there and hold back tears... (That) was hard." One man said his time on the case made him "appreciate how quickly life can end and how fleeting it can be." And that the justice system can work. "The system is designed to be fair to both sides," he said. "In fairness, you can't rush." The jurors did not find credible the defense team's contention that Hernandez's co-defendants -- Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz -- carried out the murder. The two men have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. In closing arguments, defense lawyer James Sultan for the first time placed Hernandez at the murder scene. Sultan described Wallace and Ortiz as a pair of drug dealers known to become crazed while on PCP, as men capable of killing someone in drug-induced fits of rage. "Did he make all the right decisions? No," Sultan said of Hernandez. "He was a 23-year-old kid who witnessed something, committed by somebody he knew. He really didn't know what to do, so he put one foot in front of another. Keep in mind, he's not charged with accessory after the fact.... He's charged with murder... and that he did not do." "We were all shocked about that," a female juror told reporters Wednesday. "It was very surprising," said another. Asked about post-trial fame or the possibility of book deals for their role in the sensational case, a female juror smiled. "None of us wanted to come into this room," she told the reporters gathered around her. The jurors said they expected to sleep peacefully Wednesday night. "After a beverage," one of them added. Asked whether they were leaving the experience as friends, they all seemed to say, "Yes."

Article: Ander Herrera has caught the eye in recent weeks after cementing a spot in Manchester United's starting line-up but it appears he does not actually have a clear sight at goal. Herrera netted a brace against Aston Villa on Saturday afternoon without actually looking at Brad Guzan's goal as his eyes appeared to be shut when making contact with the ball. In fact, six of Herrera's seven goals have been scored without him even having to glimpse at either the ball or the opposition's net. Manchester United star Ander Herrera scores his side's opening goal against Aston Villa with his eyes shut. The Spanish midfielder appears to have his eyes closed as he strikes at Brad Guzan's goal. Aston Villa and England midfielder Fabian Delph attempts to block Herrera's left-footed shot. His eyes were wide open when he struck an impressive first-time shot against Yeovil in the third round of the FA Cup back in January. However his double against Aston Villa and his goals against Queens Park Rangers, Leicester, Preston and Swansea all came without Manchester United's summer signing having to make eye contact with the ball. Herrera appears to have a history of shooting with his eyes closed as the image of his goal for Spain's Under 20 side back in 2009 shows. Herrera hits the back of the net while representing Spain's Under 20 side against Tahiti. The former Athletic Bilbao joined the Red Devils for £29million in the summer due to his vision and creativity in midfield. Louis van Gaal heaped praise on the 25-year-old's shooting ability after Saturday's Premier League encounter at Old Trafford, by stating: 'He has a very good kicking technique and he should be more composed,' Van Gaal said to MUTV. 'I said to him 'you have to control the ball before you shoot'. 'I said that to him again in yesterday's training session, and then I kissed him at half-time because he had controlled the ball for the first time in his life and then he shot.' Herrera's eyes were also shut for Manchester United's third goal against Aston Villa on Saturday. His only Manchester United goal scored with his eyes wide open came against Yeovil Town back in January. Herrera scored in Manchester United's 4-0 win over Queens Park Rangers without looking at the ball. The former Athletic Bilbao man flicked the ball past Preston's players without having his eyes on the ball. Herrera scored in Manchester United's 2-1 defeat by Swansea City at the Liberty Stadium in February. He also netted in Manchester United's shock 5-3 defeat at the hands of Premier League strugglers Leicester.

Ander Herrera has scored seven goals for Man United since joining in June. Herrera's eyes have been shut when striking the ball for six of his goals. His superb strike against Yeovil Town has been only goal with eyes open. Herrera netted a brace in Manchester United's 3-1 win over Aston Villa.

Article: Panama City Beach, Florida (CNN)A third person has been arrested in the case of an alleged spring break gang rape that was videotaped on a crowded stretch of Panama City Beach, the Bay County, Florida, Sheriff's Office said Wednesday. Police arrested the suspect at 11 p.m. Tuesday. "After developing information that George Davon Kennedy was the third suspect seen in the video of the gang rape, BCSO Investigators obtained a warrant for his arrest," according to a news release. Investigators discovered that Kennedy had family in DeKalb County, Georgia, and reached out to the sheriff's office there. Deputies in DeKalb, in the Atlanta area, tracked down Kennedy and arrested him on a charge of sexual assault by multiple perpetrators, the Bay County Sheriff's Office said. Kennedy is from Murfreesboro, Tennessee, and has been a student at Middle Tennessee State University, the sheriff's office said. Previously, Ryan Calhoun and Delonte Martistee were arrested and charged with sexual battery by multiple perpetrators, the sheriff's office said. Calhoun was released Saturday after posting $50,000 bond; Martistee remains in Bay County Jail, a county deputy said. Troy University in Alabama said the two are students and have been "placed on temporary suspension from school per the university's standards of conduct and disciplinary procedures. Martistee, a member of the track and field team, has also been removed from the team." Martistee is represented by a public defender. Calhoun's legal representation is unclear. No public statement has been made on either's behalf. The arrests come after a woman told police she may have been drugged and gang-raped on a beach behind a popular club in broad daylight as bystanders watched. The woman didn't recall the assault, police say, but she saw the video of her alleged assault on the news, and though the footage had to be blurred, she recognized her tattoos and contacted authorities. It's not the first time this has happened to a young woman in Panama City Beach, authorities say. Four young men were involved in the assault, Bay County Sheriff Frank McKeithen said, and while he previously said federal marshals were trying to track down a third suspect and investigators were seeking a possible witness, it's unclear if the person arrested Tuesday was someone the police had been looking for. "There's hundreds, hundreds of people standing there -- watching, looking, seeing, hearing what's going on," McKeithen said. "And yet our culture and our society and our young people have got to the point where obviously this is acceptable somewhere. I will tell you it is not acceptable in Bay County." Authorities have said they plan to interview the woman and show her the full video to see whether she knows the attackers and can help identify other suspects, said Ruth Corley, spokeswoman for the sheriff's office. Authorities are pressing charges, and the woman plans to cooperate, Corley said. Investigators were to meet with her this week. After interviewing witnesses, Bay County investigators determined the alleged rape took place between March 10 and March 12, behind Spinnaker Beach Club, a popular bar and dance club for spring breakers. She "does not remember the assault at all," Corley said. "She remembers taking a drink from a CamelBak and there is a strong possibility she was drugged." (CamelBak sells various products for transporting water or other drinks.) She was visiting Panama City Beach at the time of the assault, and is now home, authorities said. The Troy, Alabama, Police Department found the video during the course of an investigation into an unrelated shooting and turned it over to the Bay County Sheriff's Office. The video shows suspects pushing the victim's hand aside and holding her legs down, Corley said. "You can see in the video there are people two feet away. They were assaulting her, and we believe the people around her knew she was being assaulted." The suspects can be heard commenting about what they are doing to her, Corley said. Authorities have three sworn statements from witnesses stating that the assault happened, Corley said. The sheriff's office released part of the video to local TV stations, which blurred portions of it before airing. CNN is showing part of what was released. While the video is "one of the most disgusting, repulsive, sickening things that I've seen this year on Panama City Beach," it's not an isolated incident, McKeithen said. "This is not the first video we've recovered. It's not the second video. It's not the third video. There's a number of videos we've recovered with things similar to this, and I can only imagine how many things we haven't recovered." Corley said that through social media, "we have been able to find video of girls, incoherent and passed out, and almost like they are drugged, being assaulted on the beaches of Panama City in front of a bunch of people standing around." About 100,000 spring break revelers come to the beach community every year. This year, the Bay County Sheriff's Office made more than 1,000 arrests for various crimes -- about triple the number of arrests made in the same period last year. CNN's AnneClaire Stapleton, Josh Levs and Alexandra Field contributed to this report.

Article: (CNN)Remains of up to nearly 400 unaccounted for service members tied to the USS Oklahoma at Pearl Harbor will be exhumed this year, the Defense Department announced Tuesday. The hope is that most of the battleship's sailors and Marines can be identified. "The secretary of defense and I will work tirelessly to ensure your loved one's remains will be recovered, identified, and returned to you as expeditiously as possible, and we will do so with dignity, respect and care," Deputy Secretary of Defense Bob Work said in a statement. "While not all families will receive an individual identification, we will strive to provide resolution to as many families as possible." The USS Oklahoma sank when it was hit by torpedoes on December 7, 1941, during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. A total of 429 sailors and Marines on the ship were killed. Thirty-five crew members were positively identified and buried in the years immediately after the attack, according to the Defense Department. By 1950, all unidentified remains were laid to rest as unknowns at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific. In 2003, five more service members were identified, with the help of historical evidence from Pearl Harbor survivor Ray Emory, 93. Emory, a native of Peoria, Illinois, was serving as a seaman first class on the light cruiser USS Honolulu that fateful day. After the war, Emory worked in Washington state before moving to Hawaii about 30 years ago. The retiree made it his mission to ensure graves are properly identified. "It's something I looked forward to for a long time," he told CNN about Tuesday's announcement. Speaking by phone from Honolulu, Emory said that proper identification means a lot to the families of those who lost loved ones -- and to him. Next of kin were being notified starting Tuesday. Service members who are identified will be returned to their families for burial, with full military honors. WWII pilot, 99, reunited with historic C-47 plane.

Article: Louis van Gaal believes Manchester United will hit the ground running in their attempt to win the Barclays Premier League next season after persuading the Old Trafford hierarchy to agree to a short and sharp pre-season tour of America in July. After last summer’s mammoth trek across the United States, an angry United manager Van Gaal vowed that it would never happen again on his watch and believes to this day that the effects of the pre-season schedule cost his side dearly when the real action started. Now Sportsmail can reveal that Van Gaal and United have turned down offers from Asia and Australia and are about to sign off a visit to America – in all likelihood to the west coast. The trip will last in the region of 12 days – a whole week shorter than last summer - and will be over by August 1. Manchester United beat Real Madrid in Michigan last summer in front of 109,000 fans. United played four games in America last pre-season, here Wayne Rooney scores against LA Galaxy. United beat Liverpool in the final to win the International Champions Cup last summer. While rivals such as Manchester City are trekking around Australia, Van Gaal and his United players will operate out of one base in America and travel to their games from there. The club have agreed once again to rake part in the International Champions Cup that they won last summer by beating Liverpool in a final in Miami. The tournament is played all over America but this time the promoters have essentially allowed United to choose their own venues as they are so desperate to have England’s most famous club in it. Details of the competition were supposed to be announced last week with United given a provisional deadline to commit to their schedule by last Friday. However, the announcement has been put on hold while Van Gaal and United tweak final details. Last season, Van Gaal joined United after the World Cup in Brazil to find the club committed to a two-and-half week marathon comprising visits to Los Angeles, Pasadena, Denver, Washington, Detroit and, finally, Miami. Rooney scored another spectacular goal for United against Aston Villa last weekend. Following their tour of America, United suffered a slow start but are now firing on all cylinders in the league. The Dutch veteran was furious at the itinerary that he felt asked too much of his players as they were constantly asked to fly in to different time zones and even play at altitude in Colorado. Having to then play the final in Florida during a thunderstorm was the final straw. For long periods of this winter’s negotiations, Van Gaal and United seemed set to commit to a schedule on America’s East Coast. It is understand, however, that Van Gaal has recently performed a volte face and expressed a preference for the more agreeable climates of the west. Van Gaal has insisted this time that his team will travel to match venues from one base and will have no repeat of the arduous treks endured to games in Pasadena and Ann Arbor last year. One possible base is the Seattle Seahawks training camp on America’s north-west coast. The Premier League season starts early this year, with the competition kicking off on August 8.

Article: (CNN)Thousands of Syrian and Palestinian refugees trapped in the Yarmouk refugee camp have suffered what can only be described as untold indignities. But while the story is in itself tragic, it is the individual lives at the heart of the camp that make the imperative for humanitarian action so compelling. I encountered two such individuals on my mission to Damascus -- Jihad and Mohammad -- tiny, vulnerable infants who were taken from Yarmouk in recent days, a place that was described last week by the U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon as "the deepest circle of hell." The fact that they are alive truly make them miracle children. Looking into those bright young faces, touching their pristine hands, the logic of our humanitarian mandate -- the mission to protect -- never felt stronger to me. Like the wider Syrian conflict, Yarmouk has a human face; the faces of young Mohammad and young Jihad. I want to introduce you to them in the hope that you, too, will understand why I am firmly convinced that turning away is not an option -- and why the international community must act in a concerted manner to respond to the many tragedies in Syria. Jihad Ya'qoub, the youngest Palestinian refugee to flee Yarmouk, was born on March 30. His mother, Said Fatima, never imagined bringing a child into this world could be so tough. "I was hoping to drink milk and eat eggs during my pregnancy, but our financial situation did allow us to buy these expensive food items," she said. Said Fatima was living in a community where the average person survived on just 400 calories a day. Mohammad was born in Yarmouk on January 25 of this year. When ISIS -- Islamic State of Iraq and Syria -- entered the camp and tensions heightened, his mother, Nadia, fled in search of safety. Her only thoughts were to save the life of her newborn son. Yet she has not lost hope in the possibility of a dignified future. She hopes that if and when life returns to normal, she will be able to live once more with her husband and son in the family home in Yarmouk. These tales of courage and human dignity are a lesson for us all. When I next brief the Security Council, as I did a few days ago, I will tell them about Jihad and Mohammad.  I will continue to press the case for humanitarian access to other children like them inside Yarmouk, other civilians who need help where they are. To do this, hostilities will have to subside. Pressure must be exerted on armed actors in Yarmouk to this end. Beyond that, those civilians wishing to temporarily leave must be allowed to do so safely. These things are all possible. But it takes the necessary political will -- nothing more, nothing less. Yarmouk must be a place where the politics of the possible begin to take hold. I believe they can. Because to abandon such belief would be to abandon Jihad, Mohammad and thousands of other civilians like them. And that is simply not an option.

Article: Charlie Adam looked up, noticed Thibaut Courtois was off his line, and thought: ‘Why not?’ Why not, indeed. The Stoke City midfielder was 66 yards from goal but had the audacity to score what will surely be crowned the Barclays Premier League’s strike of the season. David Beckham did it against Wimbledon in August 1996, as did Wayne Rooney against West Ham last March. There was Xabi Alonso in 2006 and Maynor Figueroa three years later, too. Charlie Adam (centre) lets fly from inside his own half as he scores one of the goals of his career at Chelsea. Thibaut Courtois watches on as he is unable to stop Adam's shot from hitting the back of the net for 1-1. Yet this was different. It was not a hit and hope. It was not a lob. This was a direct shot from deep inside Adam’s own half which fooled one of the world’s greatest goalkeepers — and Adam meant it. Sportmail’s Jamie Redknapp agreed. ‘This is better than Beckham, more audacious than Rooney’s last season, This is one of the best strikes we’ve ever seen. It’s an absolutely incredible piece of play by Charlie Adam. ‘You categorise goals as great individual efforts or team goals, but that was a piece of genius. To even try it is brilliant.’ Even by the standards those at Stamford Bridge are used to seeing week in, week out, this was special. Particularly because it came from an unexpected source, from a ‘bloke who looks like a bus driver’, as former English cricket captain Freddie Flintoff colourfully put it. Nineteen years ago, when Beckham introduced himself to the world with his goal from the halfway line, he did so wearing the wrong footwear. The Manchester United great beat Wimbledon goalkeeper Neil Sullivan wearing custom-made boots embroidered with ‘Charlie’ on the tongue — adidas sending Beckham a pair which were actually intended for Rangers attacking midfielder Charlie Miller. Adam (second left) admitted he had mixed emotions after scoring the goal but losing the game. David Beckham struck from inside his own half for Manchester United against Wimbledon in 1996. Beckham celebrated the final goal in 3-0 win for United on the opening day of the 1996-97 season. Chelsea became the second team to score 100 penalties in the Premier League. Liverpool were the first and have now scored 102. Miller never got his boots as they were retired, turned into a museum piece, having helped Beckham towards his first of 115 England caps less than three weeks later against Moldova. From one Scottish Charlie to another, Adam plans to frame his boots and shirt from Stamford Bridge, but this goal is unlikely to be the making of the former Rangers, Blackpool and Liverpool midfielder as it was for Beckham. Yet in the four seconds it took for the ball to go from boot to net, Adam disproved the theory that sequels are never better than the original. ‘The manager kept saying to me, “come in the middle of the pitch”, to try to get on the ball,’ Adam said. ‘I’m not a winger, I’m not a wide left midfielder, I don’t have the pace to go in behind so I’ve seen an opening, I’ve seen the goalie off his line and I thought, “why not do it at a place like Chelsea?” 'I’ve seen the goalie back-pedalling and I was praying it would go in. I’ll remember it for the rest of my career.’ From Spain’s Marca to Italy’s La Gazzetta dello Sport, the goal has been admired worldwide. One man who does not want to see it again, however, is Jose Mourinho. It left a black mark against a win which moved them seven points clear at the top of the Premier League, yet even the Chelsea manager can admire a wonder-goal when one comes along, as much as it hurts to admit it. Even Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho had to admit that Adam's goal was a strike of the highest quality. Adam (right) celebrates with his Stoke City team-mates after scoring at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. ‘It was a fantastic goal, every player in the world would like to score a goal like that,’ Mourinho said. ‘Diego Maradona to Lionel Messi to all these brilliant players. Not all of them did score that goal in their careers.’ Maradona, Messi, and Adam. Unlike the Argentinian greats, he is known more for his heavy tackling, as Gareth Bale found out when he suffered ankle ligament damage in May 2011. Yet this was straight from the Pele playbook. Stoke had not managed a single shot on target with half-time minutes away and there seemed no danger as Adam picked up the ball 10 yards inside his own half. Courtois mistakenly thought the same. Yet this is nothing new from Adam. He did it for Blackpool reserves previously, and Ross County, too. Asked if it is something he thinks about using regularly during a game, Adam said: ‘Every time.’ Midway through this interview, Chelsea striker Didier Drogba interrupts. ‘Why?’ he asks Adam in mock indignation. ‘Tell me why?’ To which Adam replies: ‘I watch your videos.’ Indeed there are compilations of goals just as outrageous on YouTube and, on Saturday, Adam rightly earned his place in history among them.

Charlie Adam scored remarkable goal in defeat to league leaders. Even Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho full of praise for Adam's strike. Adam's goal compared to David Beckham and Xabi Alonso goals.

Article: Ronny Deila has admitted Celtic will enter the Champions League qualifiers minus defender Jason Denayer. The SPFL young player of the month for March, 19-year-old Denayer is wanted back at parent club Manchester City for a pre-season assessment. Keen to pursue a first-team breakthrough after making his international debut for Belgium last month, doubts over the future of Manuel Pellegrini may yet hand the Parkhead the chance of a second loan deal. Jason Denayer (left) is wanted back by Manchester City for pre-season to be assessed by their staff. But Deila admits that won’t happen in time for the first Champions League qualifier on July 16. ‘City want Jason back for pre-season to see what kind of level he is at and where he stands and get the group together and maybe he will be loaned out again or he will stay. That is up to Jason and the manager,’ Deila explained. ‘We will see what happens - but it is very hard just now. We will look for a central defender anyway, one maybe two.’ Ronny Deila confirmed that the defender would be missing for the Champions League qualifers in July. Denayer remains non-committal on the prospect of an extended loan deal and added: ‘I only try to focus my mind on what is happening at Celtic and try to do my best for them. I always try to give my best level for Celtic, that’s what I need to do if I’m to reach the highest level in football. ‘I haven’t spoken to Patrick Vieira or anyone at City but I hope they are happy with my progress. ‘I feel that I have improved a lot from the start of the season, I’m a more mature player and my style of play is also different from when I first arrived. ‘Some of the strikers I come up against in Scotland are big and strong. They are big and a bit different to what I have been used to but I have improved with every game.’ Denayer has been an instant hit at the club and formed a formidable partnership with Virgil van Dijk.

Article: (CNN)Deputies rushed Kenneth Morgan Stancil III from court Thursday after the 20-year-old murder suspect swore at a judge and tried to flip over a table. Stancil is accused of killing an employee Monday at Wayne Community College in Goldsboro, North Carolina. Relatives have said victim Ron Lane was gay, CNN affiliate WNCN reported, and investigators are looking into whether the shooting was a hate crime. Authorities arrested Stancil after he was found sleeping on a Florida beach on Tuesday. Just a few minutes into Thursday's hearing on the first-degree murder charge he faces, Stancil snapped back at the judge after he was offered a court-appointed lawyer. "No, I don't need one," said Stancil, who stood before the judge with his legs shackled and his arms handcuffed in front of him. "You know what I'm saying? I knew I would get life anyway." Superior Court Judge Arnold O. Jones interjected, pointing out that the maximum sentence Stancil faces is the death penalty. "Yes, I know that," Stancil fired back. "But when I knew what I had to do and I knew when I got caught, you know, I knew in my mind that I could get life, I could get the death penalty. You know what I'm saying? Do you follow my topic? I would have killed you, you know what I'm saying, if you're a f---ing child molester." The judge told him not to swear. "I don't give a f--- what you want," Stancil said, lunging forward and lifting up the table in front of him. Deputies quickly corralled him and hustled him from the courtroom. The hearing resumed about 25 minutes later, when Stancil was brought back into the courtroom, this time with his arms handcuffed behind him. When asked again by Jones whether he wanted a lawyer, his response was quick -- and calm. "Yes, sir," he said. In an interview with CNN affiliate WRAL, Stancil described himself as a neo-Nazi and said he hates gay people "with a passion." Stancil had worked for Lane, the school's print shop operator, as part of a work-study program, but was let go from the program in early March because of poor attendance, college officials said. During the interview, and during a court appearance in Florida on Tuesday, Stancil said Lane deserved to die, accusing him of being a child molester who'd made advances in online messages to Stancil's 16-year-old brother. Lane's family has described those accusations as untrue and slanderous. His cousin, Steve Smith, told WRAL that Lane never made sexual advances toward children or anyone with whom he worked. He described him as a loving man who was dedicated to family and friends. "Yes, Ron was gay. But people need to get over it," Smith said. "That's between him and the Lord, him and his savior."

Article: Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho will persist with struggling midfield trio Cesc Fabregas, Nemanja Matic and Oscar as he refuses to shuffle his squad so late in the season. Mourinho had to answer questions about his three midfielders after the hard-fought 2-1 home win over Stoke. Asked whether Oscar is struggling, as he was substituted at half-time, Mourinho said: ‘No, I don’t think he had a bad performance, I just think he was not good enough, which is a huge difference. Oscar tries a flick that doesn't come off during a disappointing display against Stoke on Saturday. Jose Mourinho insists he will stick by his players despite the three midfielders' decline in form recently. Cesc Fabregas runs with the ball, but the assists have dried up for the Spanish international in recent weeks. ‘For me football is not just mathematics. When some people write that Fabregas drops his level because the number of assists are not the same, the number of assists are probably not the same because the player that he assists does not score.’ ‘Matic, he was suspended, and after the suspension he was injured celebrating in the final, so he went back and he was not in the best condition. ‘I always think stability is very important in a team, and it’s not in April that you are going to make important changes.’ Eden Hazard was Chelsea's best player, scoring a penalty before Charlie Adam stunned the hosts with an equaliser from his own half. Loic Remy sealed the points, after Hazard laid the chance on a plate for him, and kept the Blues in command at the top of the table. Oscar was withdrawn at half time but his manager insisted he was not struggling and will bounce back. Nemanja Matic holds off a tackle in midfield, but even the defensive midfielder has been short of his best.

Article: (CNN)Robert Bates says he gets it, how you might wonder how a cop could confuse a pistol for a stun gun. Bates -- the Tulsa County, Oklahoma, reserve sheriff's deputy accused of manslaughter in the death of a fleeing suspect -- told NBC's "Today" show Friday that he used to think that, too. "Believe me," he told the show in his first appearance since being charged in the April 2 death of Eric Harris, "it can happen to anyone." Harris died after Bates shot him -- accidentally, he says -- after calling out "Taser! Taser!" in a tussle captured on a police body camera. Bates told investigators that he mistook his firearm for the stun gun. How easy is it to confuse a gun for a Taser? While Bates is at the center of the maelstrom over Harris' death, he isn't the only one under scrutiny. The Oklahoma NAACP wants charges against other officers involved in Harris' death, and a state and federal investigation into the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office's treatment of minorities. The sheriff's office also finds itself fending off allegations that supervisors were told to forge Bates' training records. In his interview Friday with "Today," Bates said he had the documentation to show he had completed the necessary training required of reserve deputies. "That is absolutely the truth. I have it in writing," he told the show. And on Thursday, a sheriff's office official denied to the Tulsa World newspaper that any records had ever been forged. As an advanced reserve deputy, sheriff's office policy calls for Bates to have completed 480 hours of the field training officer program, according to the Tulsa World. Bates would also have needed firearms certification training. Officials have yet to locate records showing what training Bates completed, said Maj. Shannon Clark of the sheriff's office. But Clark did say it's possible that some training requirements may have been waived. Sheriff Stanley Glanz has the authority to waive any department policies, Clark said. "The policies within our organization are signed off by the sheriff, but there are also policies that give the sheriff the ability to waive any policy within our organization. That's part of being a sheriff's office," Clark told the newspaper. Glanz told KFAQ radio this week that officials can't find records of Bates' firearms certification. The instructor who provided that training is now a U.S. Secret Service agent, and officials haven't been able to locate training records she was supposed to have turned in, Glanz told the station. Other discrepancies have surfaced about training that Bates claims to have attended, including questions about active shooter and homicide investigation instruction. Tulsa World reporter Dylan Goforth said the paper had been told by multiple sources that Bates' records had been falsified. The newspaper has not said who allegedly asked the supervisors to falsify the training records or why. But the orders apparently started years ago, "back when (Bates) was trying to get on as a deputy," reporter Ziva Branstetter told CNN's "New Day." Bates has donated equipment to the department and was also a donor to Glanz's re-election campaign, leading to allegations he had essentially paid to be a cop. He rejected that claim in the "Today" interview as "unbelievably unfair." Bates' attorney, Clark Brewster, also has rejected the allegations of poor training or forgery as unfounded. He said those making the accusations include fired sheriff's office employees represented by the law firm that also represents Harris' family. "His training is extensive and certainly adequate," Brewster told CNN on Thursday. Bates appeared on the "Today" show with his wife, two daughters and Brewster. He seemed composed but said he was still might be in shock over what had happened. "I can tell you it stayed with me for a number of days," Bates said. "I'm not at all sure it's not still with me today. Lack of sleep, inability to concentrate, all of those plus more. You know, I still can't believe it happened." In describing the events leading up to Harris' death, Bates said he was parked several blocks away from the site where an undercover deputy was conducting a sting operation to catch Harris in the act of illegally selling a gun. Bates said he had participated in "several hundred" such operations but always in a backup role where he would come in and "clean up" after deputies, taking photos and notes. But as deputies rolled up to arrest him after the sale, Harris bolted from the vehicle and ran toward Bates' position. As deputies were trying to subdue Harris, Bates told investigators he saw an opportunity to use his stun gun to help get the suspect under control. "I yelled, 'Taser! Taser!' as required in training. The deputy below me ducked, he pulled away from it so that I could," Bates said. "The laser light is the same on each weapon. I saw the light and I squeezed the trigger," Bates told "Today." The result was not the staccato click of a well-deployed stun gun. Instead, it was a gunshot. "I shot him! I'm sorry!" Bates is heard emotionally saying on video of the incident. Bates apologized to Harris' family, who have rejected allegations he was violent and on drugs. Harris' brother, Andre Harris, said this week that he didn't think the shooting was racially motivated. Instead, he said, "This is simply evil." But Bates,who is charged with second-degree manslaughter, said he didn't mean to kill Harris. His attorney has called it an "excusable homicide." "I rate this as No. 1 on my list of things in my life that I regret," said Bates, who is free on $25,000 bail.

Article: Tim Sherwood and Chris Ramsey may become a united force again in seasons to come. They could continue as rival managers. Whatever happens, they will remember this night when they went toe to toe for 90 minutes of top-flight football. There was adrenaline, action, twists and turns. It was good to see two English coaches who have come up through the ranks against each other in a match of this importance. Their teams’ Premier League statuses were not decided on Tuesday night, but this felt like a sliding-doors moment that directed their paths. Tim Sherwood and Chris Ramsey embrace each other as they met at Villa Park on Tuesday night. There was adrenaline, action, twists and turns as Ramsey and Sherwood went head to head at Villa Park. Queens Park Rangers led, then Aston Villa led, then Charlie Austin gave QPR a taste of victory before Christian Benteke wiped it away with his hat-trick goal. It was absorbing stuff on the pitch as well as in the technical areas, where Sherwood and Ramsey stood. They shuffled and shouted, cajoled and pointed. Never during the match did they exchange glances, perhaps too afraid to look the other in the eye and give the game away. Sherwood and Ramsey’s relationship was forged over four years at Tottenham. They helped bring through young talent; Sherwood predominantly picking and motivating, Ramsey mainly coaching. Harry Kane, Ryan Mason and Nabil Bentaleb are part of their Spurs legacy. Now Premier League bosses, they still live 10 minutes apart in Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire. They have been for pints this season and will do so again in the future no doubt, unpicking this game that had so much at stake. Sherwood tore his jacket off as he celebrated his team's goal en route to Christian Benteke's hat-trick. Sherwood throws his jacket as he celebrates the goal at Villa Park in the relegation battle. Sherwood was out at pitchside much earlier than his friend and rival, so he waited and watched as Ramsey, jacket wrapped around his waist, strode out on his own from tunnel to dugout. The Villa boss extended his hand and there was a warm embrace between the two men as an arc of photographers snapped away nearby. Sherwood wore his customary gilet. In the seventh minute it was unzipped, three minutes later it was ripped off and flung to the floor. The timings coincided with QPR’s opening goal, and Villa’s equaliser. Think Temuri Ketsbaia minus the hoarding kicks. Sherwood, as we have become accustomed, was living the match on the edge. Unafraid to hype its importance before kick-off, he was treating it as such once the whistle blew. The showdown between Sherwood (left) and Ramsey (right) ended in a 3-3 draw at Villa Park. By half-time we had seen the full show. In the 16th minute he placed his hands on his head when QPR keeper Rob Green saved from Jack Grealish. In the 24th he hurried his players to take a free-kick. Soon after he was telling fans behind his dugout to calm down after Grealish delivered a poor corner. He produced his double-fisted pump celebration after Benteke’s second, the one we saw during the latter stages of the FA Cup win over West Brom. Sherwood was more restrained in the second period, particularly when Clint Hill found a leveller. Austin’s strike left him shellshocked before Benteke put a smile back on his face. With six games to go, both men have much to think about.

Aston Villa and QPR drew 3-3 in the Premier League on Tuesday night. Tim Sherwood and Chris Ramsey's reunion had twists and turns to it. The two clubs' Premier League statuses were not decided by the draw.

Article: Garissa, Kenya (CNN)The desks of the small Madrassa are empty. Its 573 students, all male, are staying home after Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta announced three days of national mourning following last week's deadly attack at a nearby university. Only a few kilometers away, 147 people -- mostly students -- were brutally massacred when Al-Shabaab militants invaded the campus in Garissa, a town in northeastern Kenya. We've come to this particular Islamic religious school because the man suspected by Kenyan authorities of being the "mastermind" behind the atrocity -- Mohamed Mohamud -- once taught here. "He was someone who was very quiet, he didn't like too much talk," recalls Sheikh Khalif Abdi Hussein, the principal at the Madrassa. He says he also taught with Mohamud for two years. "When he left the Madrassa, he joined Al-Shabaab. But before, he was normal, just like me and other people." What worries authorities here is exactly that -- Mohamud was Kenyan. But now, say officials, Mohamud is in command of an Al-Shabaab militia based near Kenya's long, porous border with Somalia -- about 118 miles (190km) from Garissa -- who are believed to be responsible for numerous cross-border attacks into Kenya. The Islamist militant group, who are allied with al Qaeda, have been waging a bloody campaign for control of Somalia. With Kenyan troops part of an African Union force deployed in support of Somalia's United Nations-supported government, Kenya has now become a target. Last year, an attack by Al-Shabaab on a shopping center in the country's capital, Nairobi, claimed the lives of 68 people. Now Mohamud stands accused of being behind Thursday's attack -- the deadliest attack in the nation since al Qaeda killed more than 200 people at the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi in 1998. But Mohamud is not Kenya's only homegrown terrorist. The Kenyan Interior Ministry has said at least one of the four gunmen who carried out the attack on the university was also Kenyan. Abdirahim Abdullahi was in his 20s and the son of a government chief. His father says he lost contact with his son in 2013, shortly after he left university. The Kenyan government is concerned that Al-Shabaab is recruiting disaffected youth from inside the country. "Our task of countering terrorism has been made all the more difficult by the fact that the planners and financiers of this brutality are deeply embedded in our communities," President Kenyatta said during an address to the nation in the aftermath of the massacre. Meanwhile, Sheikh Khalif insists his Madrassa has nothing to do with Mohamud's extreme, violent ideas. "This man is a dangerous man, a killer, a criminal," he says. But he was also once a neighbor. And so Kenyans must now look within to tackle this very real threat to the country's -- and the region's -- stability.

Gene Ormsby claimed two tries along with Toby King and Ben Currie. The other tries came from Daryl Clark, Ashton Sims, Ben Westwood, Ben Currie and Joel Monaghan. Wakefield Wildcats coach James Webster said after the game he does not have enough players. Webster said: 'Over six weeks now we haven't had a seven-day turnaround and we find it hard to find some energy. 'I hate looking for excuses but over the last month I think we have spent around two hours as a team training together, for the simple reason I don't have enough people to fulfil training. 'There are no ifs and buts about that — I just don't have enough players. 'We trained for half an hour on our last run as a team simply because we need all our players playing or we will not fulfil our fixtures.' Regarding the defeat to Wolves he added: 'We were totally outclassed. Full credit to Warrington they were outstanding.' The Wildcats now face a Challenge Cup tie against Championship outfit Halifax on Friday night.

Article: (CNN)It's not easy being the Pope. Not only does he shepherd nearly 1 billion Catholic souls, he also leads a small but morally significant state with envoys and interests in nearly every country. As scholars like to say, the Vatican has walked the line between spiritual and worldly concerns for centuries. Sometimes, as when St. John Paul II stood up to Communist Poland, the church's moral and political clout have combined to pack a powerful punch. At other times, popes have to make a hard choice: Adopt the sharp tongue of a prophet or the discretion of a diplomat? This Sunday in Rome, Pope Francis faced just such a dilemma. First, the back story:. One hundred years ago, more than 1 million Armenians (some estimates run as high as 1.5 million) died at the hand of the Turks. Many of the victims were part of a branch of Christianity closely aligned with Catholicism. A slew of  historians and at least 20 countries call the killings a "genocide." (A U.S. resolution to do the same has languished in Congress.) Turkish officials disagree, arguing that the deaths, while unfortunate, were part of a long-running war that witnessed casualties on all sides. For their part, previous popes had finessed the genocide question. John Paul II used the "g" word in 2001, but didn't dare speak it out loud. Instead, it was tucked into a document signed by the former pontiff and the head of the Armenian church, after they had celebrated Mass together. Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI called the killings "a great evil" and "terrible persecution" in a speech 2006, but avoided labeling them genocide. (Benedict found other ways to tick off the Turks, initially opposing their entry into the European Union.) As Pope Francis prepared to celebrate a special Mass Sunday to commemorate a century since the slaughter,  Vatican watchers were divided about whether he would use the word "genocide." He did, but in a roundabout way, by quoting John Paul's document. "In the past century, our human family has lived through three massive and unprecedented tragedies," Francis said. "The first, which is widely considered 'the first genocide of the 20th century,' struck your own Armenian people." The middle phrase comes directly from the document issued 14 years ago by John Paul. In citing his predecessor, Francis highlighted one of the Vatican's chiefest concerns, especially on matters of moral import: continuity. Whether holding the line against artificial birth control, declining to ordain female priests or dealing with diplomatic tensions, it sometimes seems as if the church considers inconsistency the most unforgivable of sins. "The Vatican and the papacy love continuity," said the Rev. Thomas Reese, a Vatican analyst for National Catholic Reporter. If Francis had not called the Armenian killings a genocide, particularly at such a high-profile event -- the audience included Armenia's President -- it might have been interpreted as a change in church policy, Reese said. At the same time, Francis didn't want to anger the Turks more than necessary, especially since they have become a key ally against the persecution of Christians by ISIS in the Middle East, which the Pope alluded to in his speech on Sunday. "The fact that he quoted John Paul is a sign that he's downplaying it," Reese said of the Armenian murders. "He's telling people: There's nothing new here." New or not, Turkey was not happy. The nation recalled its Vatican ambassador for "consultations" just hours after Francis' comments, the Turkish Foreign Ministry said. Turkey also promptly summoned his counterpart, the Vatican's ambassador, for a meeting, Turkish state broadcaster TRT reported. In a tweet Sunday, Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu called the Pope's use of the word "unacceptable" and "out of touch with both historical facts and legal basis." "Religious authorities are not places through which hatred and animosity are fueled by unfounded allegations," the tweet reads. "Hatred" and "animosity" are not words often used to describe Pope Francis. Because he often shines a sympathetic face on the world, emphasizing mercy over judgment, it's easy to miss the bluntness Francis brings to the bully pulpit. On matters of doctrine and diplomacy, he may be carrying on Catholic traditions, but in his willingness to engage in geopolitics and the tone that engagement often takes, this pope is decidedly different. He has helped broker a backroom detente between the United States and Cuba, and invited Israeli and Palestinian leaders for an unprecedented prayer service at the Vatican (after annoying some Israelis with an impromptu prayer at the wall that separates the West Bank from Jerusalem.) But Francis has also suggested that force may be justified to stop ISIS' slaughter of Christians, warned of the "Mexicanization" of Argentina and said that satirists who insult religion should expect a retaliatory punch. On Monday, the Pope addressed a roomful of priests at morning Mass. He must have heard the hubbub about his "genocide" remark, but he encouraged his charges to speak frankly, without fear, and to bear the courage of their convictions, just as the early apostles had. "We cannot keep silent about what we have seen and heard," Francis said. CNN's Gul Tuysuz  and Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.

Article: (CNN)Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson will be reinstated as an active player by the NFL on Friday, the league said. The NFL suspended the 30-year-old football star in November over allegations that last May he disciplined his son, who was 4 at the time, too harshly with a "switch," or thin stick. In a letter, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell told Peterson that his continued participation in the league was contingent on a number of requirements, including that he maintain "an ongoing program of counseling and treatment as recommended by medical advisers," the NFL said Thursday. Also required of Peterson: Avoiding "any further conduct that violates the (NFL's) personal conduct policy or other NFL policies." "Any further violation of the personal conduct policy by Peterson would result in additional discipline, which could include suspension without pay or banishment from the NFL," the league said in a statement. Peterson played in one game last season, a 35-6 win against St. Louis in September, before the league put him on an exempt list September 17 -- keeping him off the field with pay -- in light of his indictment that month in the case. Initially charged with felony child abuse, Peterson pleaded no contest to misdemeanor reckless assault in November in Texas. The NFL then suspended him without pay and he lost his appeal of that sanction the next month. In February, a Minnesota district court judge vacated the decision that upheld his suspension, making Peterson eligible for reinstatement. Bleacher Report: Latest details, comments, reaction. The Vikings issued a brief statement in which they said they "look forward to Adrian rejoining the Vikings." ESPN reported that the team will hold voluntary offseason workouts beginning Monday. The next Vikings' organized team activities begin in late May. It is unclear whether Peterson will attend. He has been unhappy with how the Vikings have handled the matter. Though Peterson dodged jail time with his no-contest plea, he received probation, community service and a $4,000 fine. He also will take parenting classes. "I truly regret this incident," Peterson said after accepting the deal. "I stand here and I take full responsibility for my actions. I love my son more than any one of you can even imagine." Peterson is considered one of the best running backs in the NFL. In 2011 he signed a seven-year contract worth more than $100 million with the Vikings, who were 7-9 last season and failed to make the playoffs. In eight seasons, including last year's abbreviated year, he has rushed for 10,190 yards and averaged a strong 5.0 yards per carry. CNN's Jill Martin and Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report.

After the match, Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers conceded defeat in his quest for the top four. And while Coutinho refuses to give up hope of qualifying for Europe's elite club competition for a second consecutive season, he does admit that ending the campaign with silverware would be some consolation if that was the case. 'Winning the [FA] cup would save our season. It is very important for us to have that as an objective,' Coutinho told the club's official website. 'We have to pick ourselves up after what happened against Arsenal to get the results that we need. We want to be in the Champions League. That is our primary objective. We have seven games left and we have to see what happens.' 'Arsenal played very well, as they always do, and we did not do the things we have to do to win, the things we have done in previous games, like pressing the ball well. 'That was the difference between the two sides. It was a very difficult game but we have to pick our heads up and keep believing. We have to keep going. We have more games to come and lots of things can still happen.' After the match, Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers conceded defeat in his quest for the top four.

Article: (CNN)A Tulsa County reserve deputy is on administrative leave after "inadvertently" shooting a suspect with his gun. Police say Robert (Bob) Bates, 73,  thought he pulled out his Taser during an arrest, but instead shot the suspect, who later died at a local hospital. The shooting happened after an apparent drug and gun selling operation by the Tulsa Violent Crimes task force  Thursday. Bates, a member of the task force, was part of a group of deputies trying to arrest Eric Courtney Harris, 44, in the parking lot of a Dollar General store. Police say Harris, a convicted felon, sold undercover officers a pistol. When confronted by an arrest team, he fled the scene on foot and police say they "observed him reaching for his waistband area...causing concern for the deputies safety." After a brief pursuit, police say Harris was forced to the ground, where he continued to resist arrest and "refused to pull his left arm from underneath his body where his hand was near his waistband." It was during this portion of the arrest that police say "the reserve deputy was attempting to use less lethal force, believing he was utilizing a Taser, when he inadvertently discharged his service weapon, firing one round which struck Harris." Harris died at a local hospital and his cause of death is under investigation. Police say Harris admitted to medics at the scene that he may have been under the influence of Phencyclidine, a street drug commonly known as PCP. When asked if another gun was found on Harris, Shannon Clark of the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office says "The suspect was placed in the ambulance and transported so quickly. I have not been told there was a second weapon found on him yet." Deputy Robert Bates, who's been placed on administrative leave during the investigation, received his reserve status from the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office in 2008 and was assigned to the violent crime task force. He had also served as a Tulsa Police officer. When asked by CNN affiliate KTUL whether age may have played a factor in the "inadvertent" shooting, Clark says "did an accident happen? Sure. But is it accredited to his age? Or was it accredited to the rapidly evolving situation? I guess that will be determined in the investigation." CNN's AnneClaire Stapleton, Joe Sutton contributed to this report.

Article: Conor O’Shea has revealed his concern at the increasing force of rugby’s collisions after Harlequins and England full back Mike Brown was consigned to even more time on the sidelines to recover from the latest high-profile head injury. Brown has not played since the final round of the RBS 6 Nations on March 21, is still suffering headaches after a week-long holiday in Dubai and no closer to being declared symptom-free. The episode raises questions about whether the 29-year-old was brought back too early for England’s title-decider against France, having been knocked out in the Test against Italy five weeks earlier following a crunching collision with Andrea Masi. Mike Brown is knocked out in a collision with Italy’s Andrea Masi in the Six Nations last month. Brown was out cold for approximately eight minutes and hasn't played since the Italy game on March 21st. ‘It’s a concern because I don’t like someone coming in with something you can’t diagnose,’ said O’Shea, Quins’ director of rugby. ‘Sometimes a physio will sit you down and say, “It’s six to 12 weeks out”. Here it could be tomorrow or it could be whenever — we don’t have a timescale. There’s no doubt that a decade or even a year ago Browny would be back out on the pitch. ‘You want to see the gladiatorial side of things — the big hits that we’ve all grown up with. It was once a badge of honour that you got up and got on with it. But at least we’re now aware. Is it a concern for the game that we’re seeing collisions of the nature that we are? Yes, it has to be.’ Brown will have played just six of his club’s last 19 games after sitting out of the coming weekend, and his England team-mates Joe Marler and Chris Robshaw have featured in only eight of the last 18. Northampton have ruled out George North, who is suffering from his own concussion problems after being knocked out in three different collisions, until the end of the month and O’Shea must also deal with the absence of one of his marquee players. George North suffered his third concussion in four months during Northampton's defeat to Wasps. ‘You can look at a succession of events for George North, whereas this is a follow-on of symptoms from one event,’ said O’Shea. ‘Against Italy it was as big a hit as I’ve seen someone take. It was quite frankly a monstrous hit. I was pretty worried when I saw it live. ‘Is it tough on us having the England full back for six out of 19 games and still indeterminate? Yes, but there are more important things than rugby.’

Article: (CNN)Chinese police have arrested more than 133,000 people and seized 43.3 tons of illegal narcotics during a six-month anti-drug campaign, the country's Ministry of Public Security has announced. Authorities also handled 115,000 drug-related crimes -- such as robbery -- and 606,000 cases of drug use during the nationwide campaign to "ban drugs in hundreds of cities," Liu Yuejin, Assistant Minister of Public Security, said Wednesday. The figures were nearly double the same period a year earlier, while the amount of narcotics seized was up by 44.9%, according to the ministry. Liu said drug trafficking groups have "suffered a heavy blow" and drug users have been "forcefully regulated." However, the police also paid a price, Liu said, in quotes carried by the state-run Xinhua news agency. Nine police officers died and another 657 were wounded in the mission, with 76 severely wounded. The ministry rewarded 60 units and 100 people. Liu said China's drug-related problems were still severe, with online drug trafficking an increasing problem. He said the ministry had launched a three-month online campaign starting in April targeting people engaged in drug-related Internet crimes. Over the past nine months, a string of movie and television stars, film directors and pop singers have been arrested and charged over drug related incidents, including Jaycee Chan, son of kung fu movie star Jackie Chan, who was convicted on a drug charge and sentenced to six months in prison by a Beijing court. In August last year, dozens of management agencies representing actors and singers signed an agreement with Beijing authorities banning drug use from the entertainment industry and pledging to sack any artists who broke the law.

Article: Ben Stokes thought he had claimed his 23rd Test wicket when Jermaine Blackwood slashed his short delivery straight to Alastair Cook at slip. But the Durham all-rounder’s front foot had crossed the line and the batsman earned a reprieve. It’s not the first time this has happened to Stokes, of course — a similar error saw him denied his first Test wicket against Australia in Adelaide in 2013. Ben Stokes was denied the wicket of Jermaine Blackwood after overstepping the crease. Stokes overstepped the line when he thought he had England's fifth wicket of the day in Antigua. Stokes celebrated wildly when Brad Haddin was caught behind on that occasion, and the pair clashed when the decision was overturned. Michael Vaughan, while commentating on BBC’s Test Match Special, thinks the 23-year-old should return to his natural style of bowling. ‘Stokes is trying to be a very English-type bowler,’ Vaughan said. ‘But when I’ve seen him bowl really well, I’ve seen him bowl short spells: really fast, with lots of bouncers.’ England gather in celebration of Stokes' wicket, only for it to be overturned by the umpire. Vaughan’s BBC colleague, Jonathan Agnew, thinks England will rue Tuesday’s showing. ‘England will look back on today as a missed opportunity in terms of batting,’ he said. ‘They still have the advantage, they’ve kept chipping away with wickets and they’ve kept things very tight, but they could have done with that Blackwood wicket.’

Article: (Billboard)Fresh off his scorching performance at Coachella Saturday night (and days before his next one on the festival's second weekend), rocker Jack White announced he'll take a hiatus from touring. White will wrap his touring efforts in support of "Lazeretto" with a brief, first-ever acoustic tour that will hit "the only five states left in the U.S. that he has yet to play," according to White's website. Rounding out the acoustic quartet on tour will be Fats Kaplin, Lillie Mae Rische and Dominic Davis. The shows will be unannounced until day-of-show, with tickets priced at $3 and limited to one ticket per person, to be purchased only at the venue on a first-come, first-served basis. Billboard: Jack White on Not Being a 'Sound-Bite Artist,' Living in the Wrong Era and Why Vinyl Records Are 'Hypnotic' The purposely vague announcement surely has fans (and journalists) scouring the Internet for White's touring history. Unclear is whether White includes his work with The White Stripes, The Raconteurs and Dead Weather in his touring history, or just his solo road work. Presumably, he's including all of his touring, with all bands, as Billboard could find only 29 states in which he has performed as Jack White. Tour dates with White Stripes add another 12 states. That leaves nine states for which we could not find a show for White: Hawaii (where a show is scheduled for tomorrow, April 15), Arkansas, Idaho, Utah, Wyoming, Vermont, Iowa, and North and South Dakota.

Through the process of elimination (surely he has played Boise, Little Rock, and Salt Lake?), our guess as to which five "states" White will play on the brief acoustic run: South and North Dakota, Wyoming, Vermont and... Puerto Rico? If that's the case, this tour is in for some long jumps, with Puerto Rico to Vermont being a potential beast.

Article: It seems that scoring stunning volleys in Tyne-Wear derbies is not the limit of Sunderland striker Jermain Defoe's limits as he shows off his impressive keepy up skills with a tennis ball. Fresh from his heroics on Sunday when he struck a brilliant volley to earn his side victory against Newcastle at the Stadium of Light, Defoe was the first player to take part in Sunderland's keepy up challenge. The former Tottenham forward set an impressive score of 76 for his team-mates to beat before taking the second part of the challenge - keepy ups with a Creme Egg. Tyne-Wear derby hero Jermain Defoe takes on the Sunderland keepy up challenge. The former Tottenham and West Ham striker is the first Sunderland player to take the challenge. Defoe eventually sets an impressive score of 76 for his team-mates to attempt to beat. Defoe was unable to replicate the high score achieved with the tennis ball but managed to post a respectable-looking nine with the Easter treat. Defoe was overcome with emotion in the wake of his brilliant blast, and admits the joy it brought to a sold-out Stadium of Light was too much to take in. 'I have said many times that I missed the Premier League and it's because of games like this,' he said. 'Games like this are why I came back. Being at a club like this, they just love football. I was told before that if I come here and work hard and score goals, they won't ask for anything more. Sunderland striker Jermain Defoe celebrates after scoring a stunning volley against Newcastle. Defoe's superb first-half strike was enough to secure a 1-0 win for Sunderland in the Tyne-Wear derby. Newcastle goalkeeper Tim Krul was completely helpless as Defoe's shot found its way into the top corner. 'And I just love scoring goals, the fans deserved it. It's been really difficult for them in the last few weeks but they always turn out. 'It was the whole occasion really that got to me. It was great to be the person that made so many people happy. I was just thinking, "Why me?". 'As the whistle went for half-time and as I was walking down the tunnel I thought, "I'm crying and I'm on the telly", but I didn't care. For the fans and everyone it was just a special day.' The 32-year-old not only wrote his name into Sunderland folklore with his derby winner at the weekend but boosted Dick Advocaat's side survival hopes. The North East club moved three points clear of the relegation zone with seven games to play as the Dutch manager earned his first win since taking charge.

Article: Sanaa, Yemen (CNN)As the transport plane comes in to land at Sanaa Airport, the deep scars of the brutal conflict tearing Yemen apart are only too clear: wrecked aircraft line the runway, and nearby buildings lie in ruins. To most of the outside world, this war-torn country is off limits, the weeks-long battle between Houthi rebels and Saudi-led coalition forces making it too dangerous to visit, and a no-fly zone rendering its international airport all but obsolete -- but on Tuesday, CNN was granted rare access on a desperate aid mission by Unicef, the United Nations Children's Fund. The airport has previously been bombed. Hostilities are likely to resume before the day is out: a brief, peaceful window has been delicately negotiated following a special request from the U.N. -- but it won't last long. Unicef hopes there will be just enough time to deliver vital food and supplies, helping to ease the country's worsening humanitarian crisis. More than 100,000 Yemeni civilians have fled their homes since fighting began, and OCHA, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, estimates that 15.9 million people here are in need of assistance. The main terminal at El Rahaba Airport is under the control of the Houthi rebels. We can't get near it for fear of provoking trouble. But there is plenty to be done out on the tarmac. Within minutes of touching down, a small army of aid workers is busy unloading huge mounds of much-needed provisions. Gusts of wind blow dust across the runway, as crates and pallets of emergency nutrition and medical equipment pile up rapidly beside the plane. Unicef's team has overcome more than one hurdle just getting it this far -- now they'll have to work out how to distribute it to those most in need in a country paralyzed by a lack of resources. Even before Saudi airstrikes, most of the 25 million people in Yemen required humanitarian assistance to meet their most basic needs, according to the United Nations. As they work, an Air India plane is taxiing away from the terminal. Thousands have fled the country on evacuation flights in recent weeks as the situation in Yemen has deteriorated. But for those who have nowhere else to go and no chance of a flight out, mercy missions by Unicef and other NGOs like it are the only hope.

Despite widespread speculation about a pending deal with former Mainz coach Thomas Tuchel, Hamburg said they had agreed on a 15-month contract with Labbadia, who had coached them in 2009-10. The coach's contract is also valid for the second division should Hamburg be relegated. He takes over from interim coach Peter Knaebel who replaced sacked Joe Zinnbauer in March and will now return to his post as sports director. Hamburg have appointed Bruno Labbadia as their new coach on a 15-month contract. 'We decided to take this step because we consider the coach question the most important,' said Hamburg CEO Dietmar Beiersdorfer in a statement. 'With Bruno Labbadia we now have a strong coach who is also experienced in relegation battles.' Beiersdorfer said the club had ended talks with Tuchel after an agreement could not be reached. Hamburg are the only club with a perfect Bundesliga record, having played every season in the top division since the league's creation in 1963. Labbadia returns to Hamburg for a second spell after coaching the club for one season in 2009-10. The 49-year-old Labbadia, a former Hamburg player, has also coached Bayer Leverkusen and VfB Stuttgart among other. 'We have no time to waste,' Labbadia said. 'Every point matters for us and I am happy that Hamburg has such support from the fans. Because we have to be a unit until the last matchday.'

Article: (CNN)Their eyes reflect childhoods marked by tragedy. Their faces show wrinkles made deeper by pain and the passage of time. Tomasz Lazar spent hours photographing and interviewing adults who were ripped from their homes as children in the 1940s and forced to live thousands of miles away in Siberia. "For me those faces are like maps," Lazar said. "The more you look at them, the more you are discovering." Soviet authorities invaded Poland during World War II and deported hundreds of thousands of Poles. Some were sent to prison camps in the frozen wilderness of central Russia. Many were children. In effect, Moscow stole much of an entire generation of young Poles, a handful of whom Lazar has located seven decades later. During Lazar's interviews, many of the survivors broke down in tears. "It was very traumatic for them," he said. "Some lost mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters -- killed by the Soviets." Lazar remembers hearing 84-year-old Boguslaw Dokurno recall his grandfather's dying wish. Dokurno's grandfather asked his grandson to return home to Poland after his death to retrieve Polish soil and bring it back to his Siberian gravesite. Another exile, Sofia Bocian, told Lazar how her brother escaped their prison camp, leaving her with the horrifying experience of being interrogated by Soviet secret police.

Article: The England C team is facing the axe after 36 years as part of Greg Dyke’s spending review at the Football Association. FA chairman Dyke must find £30million to fund his masterplan to reform grassroots football with more 3G pitches in urban coaching hubs, and has identified the non-league national team as an area of potential saving. England C, which has operated under different names since it was formed in 1979, is managed by former Barnet boss Paul Fairclough, who selects from players outside the Football League, aged 23 and under. FA chairman Greg Dyke could axe the England C team to save money to help improve grassroots football. The team normally plays only three or four times a season, but some friendly fixtures have attracted attention inside the organisation because of the elaborate travel involved. England won 6-1 in Bermuda, in June 2013, and won 1-0 in Jordan, in March last year. Fairclough’s team also compete in the International Challenge Trophy, a competition for European semi-pro national teams, but did not qualify for the semi-finals of this year’s tournament from a home-and-away qualifying group featuring Turkey, Slovakia and Estonia. They were beaten by Cyprus U21s in friendly in Larnaca, in February, but there are no more fixtures planned and, since a meeting last week, fears have increased about the long-term future for a team which has been known since its formation as the National Game XI, England Semi-Pro and England Non-League. Paul Fairclough (left) is the current manager of the team and he selects non-league players under 23. Those capped at this level include George Boyd of Burnley, Craig Mackail-Smith of Brighton and Steve Morison of Leeds, who all went on to play at full international level, although not for England. Boyd and Mackail-Smith won caps for Scotland and Morison for Wales. Former Leicester winger Steve Guppy won one senior England cap after playing once for his country at non-league level. Guppy also won one cap for the U21s and one for England B, which could make him the ultimate one-cap wonder. Barnsley manager Lee Johnson was also capped at non-league level. George Boyd (right) played for the England C team before switching allegiances and playing for Scotland.

Greg Dyke could axe the England C team to find the needed £30million. The FA chairman needs the money to help with his grassroots plans. Premier League player George Boyd played for the non-league team.

Article: (CNN)The lawyer for Robert Bates, an Oklahoma reserve deputy who fatally shot a man he meant to subdue with a Taser, on Saturday released  documents that he says verify some of Bates' training as a law enforcement officer. The documents show Bates had one Taser training class over a six-and-a-half-year period, took three firearms training classes and qualified 10 times, from 2009 to 2014, to use a handgun. His evaluations say he got along with other officers and related well with the public. "Robert Bates has met all the requisite training required by Oklahoma to be a reserve deputy," said the lawyer, Scott Wood, in an interview with CNN. Read the documents. CNN could not independently confirm the documents were authentic. Wood said he got them from Bates, who asked the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office to provide his training records. The sheriff's office has turned down CNN's requests for the training documents, saying they are part of the investigation. Authorities did not reply Saturday to a request for comment on Wood's statements. The documents are important because Bates' training has become a central issue in the case. The lawyer for the family of the man who was killed claims that Bates, 73, wasn't qualified to be on the force, but received preferential treatment because he'd made donations to the agency and was a friend of the sheriff. The Tulsa World newspaper reported some supervisors in the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office were told to forge Bates' records and were reassigned when they refused. The Tulsa County Sheriff's Office has denied these allegations. The documents provided to CNN cover the period from July 22, 2008, to December 12, 2014. Bates had one Taser training class, on March 4, 2009, according to a document with a heading from The Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training, which sets the standards for training peace officers in the state. Wood said the council requires only one hands-on class on use of a Taser. Bates had weapons training once in September 2008 and twice in 2009, according to sheriff's office records that Bates obtained, Wood said. He scored high enough at the pistol range 10 times from September 24, 2009, to April 9, 2014, that he was allowed to carry a handgun while on duty, Wood said. Bates is charged with second-degree manslaughter in the death of Eric Harris. Friends and family of Harris gathered in Tulsa on Saturday afternoon for a visitation and viewing. Bates is free on $25,000 bond. He says he meant to use his Taser on Harris during the April 2 arrest but accidentally fired his handgun instead. "I shot him! I'm sorry!" Bates is heard saying on video of the incident. Bates, an insurance company executive, has gone to his own defense. In an interview Friday with the "Today" show on NBC, Bates said he had the documentation to show he had completed the necessary training required of reserve deputies. "That is absolutely the truth. I have it in writing," he told the show. Questions have already been raised about Bates' training and when his service with the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office started. In his statement to investigators, Bates said he "became an advanced TCSO Reserve Deputy in 2007." Wood said Bates started working for the sheriff's office in late 2007 or 2008. But the sheriff's office has said Bates had been a reserve deputy since 2008. Bates, who worked as a police officer for one year in the 1960s, completed 300 hours of training and 1,100 hours of community policing experience since becoming a reserve deputy, according to the sheriff's office. The Tulsa World said 480 hours of field training are required to be an "advanced" reserve deputy, which Bates claimed to be. Questions have been raised about Bates' firearms qualifications scores. To be allowed to carry a pistol on duty, deputies need to score 72 while firing at a silhouette of a man at the firing range, Wood said. Documents with a heading "Firearms Qualification Record" show Bates scoring at least 72 on six different days. But firearms qualification records from four dates in 2012 and 2013 are missing for the entire sheriff's office, Wood said. The Tulsa County Sheriff's Office says it can't find the records. The department's summary of Bates' weapons training shows he scored 80-84 those four times. "If you're going to forge somebody's score why not give them a 90 or a 95," Wood said. CNN provided the documents to the Tulsa World. Ziva Branstetter, an editor with the newspaper, said the new information doesn't undercut the World's reporting. "These records back up the validity of our story and we stand by our story," she said Saturday. Another seeming oddity of the records is how many classes Bates took on two days. The Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training records show Bates took 14 training classes worth 20 credit hours on December 10, 2013, and 20 classes worth 31 credit hours on December 11, 2014. Wood said Bates may have been cramming in his required training before the end of the year by taking computer classes. "It's possible you could take a half-hour class and if you know the material you could finish it in 15 minutes," he said. Evaluations show supervisors had a good opinion of Bates. One from March 14, 2009, says of his strengths: "Works well with his fellow officers and relates to the public very well." His weakness: "Radio usage/geography." Remedial training: "Does not have a lot of radio usage time which will be worked on. Will have to work on his geography skills. Both will be remedied in time!"

Article: Ben Flower has been urged to be 'a bit more aggressive' when the prop sensationally sent off in last year's grand final returns for Wigan in Thursday's Super League derby with Warrington. The 28-year-old Welsh international forward on Tuesday completed his six-month ban for twice punching Lance Hohaia in the opening moments of October's Grand-Final at Old Trafford. Flower stunned the 76,000 crowd with his attack on the St Helens half-back and, after becoming the first player to be sent off in a Grand Final, was handed the second heaviest suspension in the history of Super League. Ben Flower's sickening blow on St Helens' Lance Hohaia in the Super League final that got him a six-month ban. Flower, here walking off after being shown a grand final red card, will return on Thursday against Warrington. Wigan coach Shaun Wane says he wants Flower back 'a bit more aggressive and a bit stronger and a bit fitter' St Helens possibly needed something out of the ordinary to help end an eight-year spell without a Grand Final title. Ben Flower’s two brutal punches on Lance Hohaia, which led to the dismissal of the Wigan prop inside two minutes, fit that description. CLICK HERE to read Martha Kelner's full Super League Grand Final report. Wigan coach Shaun Wane told a news conference at the DW Stadium on Tuesday that he will throw Flower straight back in, almost certainly from the bench, and expects him to be just as physical. 'I hope he's a bit more aggressive and a bit stronger and a bit fitter,' Wane said of Flower, who underwent knee surgery during his enforced lay-off. 'He's without a doubt one of the best front rowers in the comp and that's we want. We need a Ben Flower in our team. He's dynamic, just what I like, he runs the ball hard and he's uncompromising. He's perfect for me. Flower falls on Hohaia after first punching the New Zealand international to the ground. Referee Phil Bentham was given no choice but to make Flower the first player sent off in a grand final. 'I'll be telling him to go as hard as he can, run as hard as you can, hit as hard as you can and just carry on from where you left off because bear in mind in the play-off games last year he was one of the best. I want him back to that form as quickly as possible.' Flower, who was fined 50 per cent of his wages during his ban and has been coaching local juniors as part of the punishment handed out by his club, is ready to 'rip in', according to Wane. 'He's in a very, very good state of mind,' the coach said. 'He's very strong and he's trained really well. I can't wait to put him in. I'm really looking forward to it. I've been itching for this game to come and he'll get a chance. 'He just wants to get back to what he's paid to do, playing rugby and being one of the best middles in the competition. 'He's had a long pre-season and he's dying to rip in.' Flower's second punch (left) became the focal point of the all-in brawl which broke out in the first three minutes. A bloodied Hohaia is helped from the field - he received a one-match ban for the forearm that sparked the fight. Wane says Flower is in a'very good state of mind' after a long enforced pre-season. Wane will bring Flower straight back into the Warriors line-up, almost certainly from the bench. Meanwhile, Wane has denied that Wigan are close to finalising the return of England full-back Sam Tomkins. The former Man of Steel has been granted a release from the last year of his three-year contract with New Zealand Warriors after becoming homesick and it is thought he is heading back to the Warriors, who retained first option on his services. 'He's one of the best players in the world and we're always interested in the best players but I've been told nothing,' Wane said. 'Unless I get a phone call today telling me anything different, I'm just cracking on preparing for Warrington and Wakefield.'

Article: (CNN)A naturalized U.S. citizen pleaded not guilty in Ohio Friday to federal charges of providing material support to terrorists and lying to the FBI. Abdirahman Sheik Mohamud, 23, of Columbus, allegedly traveled to Syria for training and wanted to return home to kill Americans -- particularly U.S. soldiers, execution style, the U.S. Department of Justice said Thursday. Mohamud was remanded into custody on Friday. "I am confident in the system working fairly and (in) our client getting a vigorous and aggressive defense," said his lawyer, Sam Shamansky. Mohamud told someone that he wanted to target U.S. armed forces, police officers or other people in uniform, the indictment alleges, adding that "Mohamud's plan was to attack a military facility, and his backup plan was to attack a prison." "Mohamud talked about doing something big in the United States. He wanted to go to a military base in Texas and kill three or four American soldiers execution style," it says. Mohamud allegedly said he was happy that his brother, Aden, died fighting for al-Nusra Front, al Qaeda's largest affiliate in Syria. Mohamud told someone he planned to join Aden in death soon, the indictment says. He became a U.S. citizen in February 2014 and submitted a U.S. passport application days later, according to the indictment. Mohamud traveled to Syria in April 2014 "for the purpose of training and fighting with terrorists," prosecutors said in a news release. To get there, Mohamud bought a one-way ticket to Greece with a layover in Istanbul, Turkey, the Department of Justice said. He skipped the connecting flight "and instead completed pre-arranged plans to travel to Syria." Once there, he trained in shooting weapons, breaking into homes, using explosives and hand-to-hand combat, prosecutors said. Mohamud "also stated that, after completing this training, he was instructed by a cleric in the organization to return to the United States and commit an act of terrorism." CNN's John Newsome contributed to this story.

Article: Are these the kits that Manchester United fans will hope lead them to a prosperous 2015-16 campaign? Supposed images of the club's home, away and third strips for next season have leaked on to the internet, which is bound to excite many an United supporter. Last summer the Old Trafford outfit announced that they had signed a £750million deal with Sportwear giant adidas to make their kits for 10 years starting from the 2015-16 campaign. Supposed leaked images of Manchester United's (left) new adidas kit for next season have been  online.

Nike replaced Umbro as United's kit supplier in 2002 while Adidas are about to start their second stint with United, having designed the club's kits from 1980-92. United's rumoured home strip for next season has done the rounds for a while but it is the designs of the away and third kit that will catch the eye. The Red Devils' second strip is predominately white with the iconic three adidas stripes running down the sleeves in Manchester United red and accompanied with a V-neck collar in the same colour. The away jersey is reported to be complemented with black and red shorts and white socks. United's third kit for next season differs from this year's ensemble too with blue replaced for black. Unlike the away jersey though, a crew neck collar is used alongside a flashy red monochromatic club badge and a red adidas Performance logo. Adidas first designed United's (left) club's kits for 12 years between 1980-92. Arguably United's most memorable season, their 1998-99 campaign shirt sponsor was Umbro.

Article: (CNN)Most airline pilots have an above average ability to compartmentalize personal problems. The cockpit is our "safe" place. The flight deck is a structured world of black and white. Checklists. Procedures. Standardization. Stress from the job is an accepted part of our career. However, sometimes during the course of an airline pilot's career, or anyone's career for that matter, stress issues may manifest as depression. Depression is treatable. And for airline pilots, it is no longer debilitating to our livelihood. The Federal Aviation Administration now approves certain prescribed medication, allowing us to continue flying until depression is no longer a factor. As the world learns more about Andreas Lubitz, the co-pilot on Germanwings Flight 9525, it is readily apparent that this young man had psychiatric issues far beyond clinical depression. He reportedly was administered a series of injections to mitigate his problems, an absolute reflection on the serious nature of his illness. But Lubitz's illness didn't just appear out of thin air.  Its effects had to be apparent to others. Lubitz's girlfriend made her concerns public knowledge -- unfortunately after events took their course. Considering the hoops Lubitz had to jump through to have established himself as a Germanwings co-pilot, it's curious to me how the red flags of his illness were missed. To what hoops am I referring? First, let's start with his passion for gliders. Glider flying is one of the purest forms of aviation. Although it is mostly an individualistic endeavor, the sport involves teamwork. Interaction among fellow enthusiasts is paramount to both enjoyment and safety. I'm a glider pilot. Participation among the members of my club uncovers the personalities and idiosyncrasies of each pilot. Behaviors not quite conducive to the activity are readily apparent. Second, Lubitz had to compete successfully in a selection process just to have the opportunity to train through Lufthansa's flight program, a requirement of Germanwings employment. The selection process is most likely highly competitive, requiring above-average aptitude. Is the selection process flawed to the extent that a serious mental disorder would go unnoticed? Regardless, the process had to be a stressful experience. Opinion: Germanwings and the stigma of mental illness. Once accepted into the flight program, a rigorous training period began. For primary training, Lufthansa utilizes an ab initio (from the beginning) program based at a facility the airline owns in Goodyear, Arizona, near Phoenix. The training is geared toward a multi-crew pilot license, or MPL, recognized by the International Civil Aviation Organization. The purpose of an MPL is to funnel airline pilot candidates having little or no flight time into the right seat as first officers. Countries that don't have the luxury of selecting from a large pool of experienced pilots use this license. Airline pilots in the United States are not licensed in this manner, requiring as much as 1,500 hours to qualify as a co-pilot. This is a fairly recent change in FAA regulations, initiated as a result of the 2009 Colgan Airlines crash in Buffalo, New York. Lubitz had barely over 600 hours of flight time when he committed his act of horror. As a 21-year-old flight instructor, I had that much flight time; it hardly qualified as a lot of experience. As with all of the MPL programs, the training involves an intense period of airline-specific instruction. And to add insult to injury, candidates are not paid during the training until such time as they pass a final check ride. Regardless, the cost is borne by the student to the tune of about $76,000. Using both actual flight experience in a single-engine airplane and simulator time, the student receives about 250 hours of training. It is a period of almost constant supervision. Aside from observing and checking performance criteria, wouldn't at least one instructor have noticed behavioral issues in such an intense environment? And wouldn't a fellow trainee have noticed also? According to reports, Lubitz took a leave from his training -- a very untypical behavior. Was that not in and of itself a red flag?  Wouldn't a manager in Lufthansa's flight department consider it prudent to reconsider a candidate with an indication of potential issues? After all, the selection process was most likely highly competitive, with other qualified candidates readily available. Once the primary training in Arizona was complete, Lubitz would have returned to Germany and completed more specific schooling on the Airbus A320 he was about to fly. Again, no one observed issues. But even more curious, according to reports, Lubitz disclosed a diagnosis of previous depression to Lufthansa. Over the course of a career, an airline pilot spends thousands of hours sharing the confined space of the cockpit with colleagues. Even if we have never flown with a particular individual, experience allows us the intuition to know when something isn't quite right. That determination can be made through performance observation of typical routines, or perhaps through a simple conversation. In that regard, I find it difficult to believe that none of Lubitz's colleagues made a less than positive assessment at some point in time. As supplemental background, Germanwings had been established as the low-cost, alter ego carrier of Lufthansa. Depending upon a pilot's monthly flight time, salary for pilots can be as much as 20% lower than the mainline carrier. In addition, more days on duty were part of a Germanwings crew member's schedule. Apparently as late as March 20, Lufthansa pilots had been on strike, one of the main disputes being an early retirement option and less desirable working conditions for new hires. Perhaps enough of a disparity existed for Germanwings pilots such that medical leave benefits would not have covered Lubitz's absence. Regardless, all of these factors combined to add a perfect storm of stress to one sick 27-year-old man. The world knows the end result. It just seems to me that this was an accident waiting to happen. Could it have been prevented? Well, this is the primary purpose of accident investigation: Never allow the same tragedy to occur again.

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence. Andreas Lubitz, the co-pilot of Germanwings Flight 9525, had a history of depression and mental health issues that were not properly addressed by his employer or training program, leading to the tragic crash that killed

Article: Celtic retained their seven-point lead at the top of the Scottish Premiership with an easy 2-0 win over 10-man Partick at Parkhead. The home side laid siege to the Thistle defence at the start of the match but had to rely on a Kris Commons penalty a minute before the break to give them the interval lead. Thistle midfielder James Craigen had been shown a straight red card by referee Willie Collum for a 'last man' foul on Hoops midfielder Stuart Armstrong to concede the spot-kick. leaving the visitors a player down for the second half. Stuart Armstrong is brought down by Partick Thistle's James Craigen leading to a penalty. Referee Willie Collum shows Craigen a read card for his 'last man' challenge on Armstrong. Celtic striker Kris Commons steps up to convert the penalty to give his side a 1-0 lead before the break. Commons (right) races away to celebrates his 45th minute penalty strike. Midfielder Stefan Johansen, stand-in skipper in the absence of suspended Scott Brown, added a second in the 63rd minute as the encounter turned into a Hoops procession. With second-placed Aberdeen beating Inverness 1-0, Ronny Deila's side maintained the gap over the Dons but also have a game in hand as the title race draws closer to conclusion. With a heavy schedule in mind, the Hoops boss returned midfielder Nir Bitton, Gary Mackay-Steven and striker John Guidetti his starting line-up. Thistle manager Alan Archibald was forced into one change with forward Kallum Higginbotham coming in for the injured Kris Doolan but he was mostly a spectator as the Firhill defence was forced to withstand an early Hoops' barrage. Celtic came close twice before two minutes had elapsed. Stefan Johansen doubles Celtic's advantage in the 63rd minute with left-footed shot into the bottom corner. Johansen is mobbed by his team-mates following his second-half strike. Parkhead defender Virgil van Dijk, up for a corner, flicked an Armstrong cross against the crossbar at the near post before a desperate blocking tackle by Maryhill defender Conrad Balatoni prevented an almost certain goal from Johansen's drive. Balatoni again came to Thistle rescue in the ninth minute, beating Guidetti to a header in front of an empty goal, after left-back Emilio Izaguirre had troubled Fox after surging into the penalty area. Moments later, Mackay-Steven was set up Johansen but his goalbound drive from 12 yards was deflected away by Thistle defender Callum Booth. Yet, in the 21st minute, in a rare attack, the visitors almost snatched the lead but Higginbotham's spectacular volley from 14 yards was saved by Craig Gordon - but only on the stretch. Commons' long-distance drive in the 28th minute just cleared the bar but a minute before the break he was more accurate from the spot, firing the penalty low into the corner giving the despairing Fox no chance. Leigh Griffiths spurns a glorious opportunity to put Celtic 3-0 ahead late in the match. The goal came as some relief to the home fans who had grown slightly irritated as the first half wore on. Two minutes after the break Commons forced Fox into a decent save with a powerful 25-yard drive and while the Maryhill defence cleared their lines from rebound it looked ominous. Thistle continued to defend stoutly and desperately in equal measures but were undone again when Johansen took a clever Guidetti pass before rolling the ball into the corner of the net from 10 yards. Two minutes after replacing Guidetti, Leigh Griffiths somehow turned a Mackay-Steven cross past the far post from two yards out but it was inconsequential. In the 79th minute, with the game drifting, Gordon made another good save, this time from Thistle substitute Gary Fraser, on for Stuart Bannigan. Johansen came close at the other end with a chip which Fox tipped over the bar, after the Norwegian had weaved his way through the Jags defence.

Article: Jordan Spieth believes he will be better equipped to cope with the pressure of trying to win the Masters after coming close to creating history last year. Spieth held a two-shot lead after seven holes of the final round 12 months ago as he looked to surpass the absent Tiger Woods as the youngest ever Masters champion, as well as being the first player to win on their tournament debut since Fuzzy Zoeller in 1979. That lead became a two-shot deficit as he bogeyed the eighth and ninth and Bubba Watson birdied the same holes, Watson eventually going on to win his second green jacket in the space of three years. Jordan Spieth plays a shot during a practice round at Augusta on Tuesday as he gears up for the Masters. Spieth believes he is better equipped to win the first major of the year after coming close on his debut in 2014. The 21-year-old skims a ball across a lake at Augusta during a relaxed practice round. Spieth finished joint second with Sweden's Jonas Blixt and comes into this year's event having won his second PGA Tour title in the Valspar Championship and finishing second in his next two tournaments. Speaking about last year's final round, the 21-year-old said: 'That was definitely the highest amount of pressure I've ever felt. That first tee shot, I think I hit it into the ninth fairway and was just real quick off the tee. Played pretty much the entire round feeling different than I've ever felt on the golf course. 'I enjoyed it, but at the same time when you're feeling that kind of pressure, it's hard to get comfortable picking fearless shots, and then I kind of bailed out on a couple of swings, trying to look up a little quickly. 'I guess the hardest lesson taken from last year was that I had an opportunity to make a dream come true, and I had it in my hands, and then I was just a little anxious. You can make the excuse that as a first-timer and 20 years old, that that's likely to happen. Spieth, pictured in action at last year's Masters, threw away a two-shot lead to finish joint second in 2014. Bubba Watson hugs Spieth after tapping in to win his second green jacket at Augusta last year. 'But in my mind, I was playing the best through 61 holes and had an opportunity to continue that the next 11 holes and didn't quite close it out.' Spieth, who has been paired with Henrik Stenson and Billy Horschel for the first two rounds, added: 'Last year I remember being in here saying I had no expectations, didn't know what it was going to be like, never played the tournament before. 'This year, I come in maybe expecting to play well on a course I feel very comfortable on. I feel like it suits my game nicely and also I feel like I've been playing well. 'Having been so close last year and having a little experience and riding some momentum, I hope to put myself in contention and use what I've learned since last year. 'I think last year's event, I certainly took a couple things out of it, as well as the positives that came from closing out a couple of tournaments at the end of the year and a few weeks ago.'

Article: (CNN)Wanted: film director, must be eager to shoot footage of golden lassos and invisible jets. CNN confirms that Michelle MacLaren is leaving the upcoming "Wonder Woman" movie (The Hollywood Reporter first broke the story). MacLaren was announced as director of the movie in November. CNN obtained a statement from Warner Bros. Pictures that says, "Given creative differences, Warner Bros. and Michelle MacLaren have decided not to move forward with plans to develop and direct 'Wonder Woman' together." (CNN and Warner Bros.

Article: Marcelo insists Real Madrid's this season's meetings with local rivals Atletico Madrid will have no bearing on the outcome of their Champions League quarter-final tie. The reigning champions face Diego Simeone's side at Vicente Calderon on Tuesday night in the first leg of the last eight clash having failed to beat their neighbours in six attempts this season. Carlo Ancelotti's side lost both La Liga matches against Atletico this season - 2-1 at the Bernabeu before a humiliating 4-0 away defeat - and have also been beaten twice and held to two draws in the Spanish Supper Cup and the Copa del Rey. Marcelo says Real Madrid's failure to beat Atletico in six attempts this season will have no affect on their Champions League quarter-final tie. Marcelo and Cristiano Ronaldo looked relaxed in training on Monday ahead of Tuesday's first leg. Brazil international Marcelo faces the media on Monday ahead of Tuesday's match at Vicente Calderon. But Brazil international Marcelo says he and his team-mates are not thinking about their recent form against Tuesday's opponents. 'We have played against Atletico a lot and something always changes,' Marcelo told reporters at a press conference on Monday. There are no favourites in a match like this. We will give everything on the pitch without thinking about previous games.' 'They are a great team. They never stop fighting and they are very intense. But we are not thinking about the last games against them. Now is completely different. We have two games to show that we can beat them.' Ronaldo and Bale leave the field dejected after Real Madrid were beaten 4-0 by Atletico in February. The last time Real Madrid beat their local rivals was in the Champions League final last season. Carlo Ancelotti and Marcelo task questions at the pre-match press conference. 'We have to go out and give everything on the pitch this time. We will have to be very intense. We will have to fight. These derbies are very difficult.' The last time Real beat Atletico was in last season's Champions League final when Sergio Ramos scored in the 93rd minute to take the game to extra-time, before Gareth Bale, Marcelo and Cristiano Ronaldo made it 4-1. 'I don't know how many times we have spoken about Ramos' Decima goal this week,' Marcelo added. 'I was available for the final and I never lost faith in helping the team. That's what happened and I was able to help the team win the Champions League. I consider myself very important in this team.'

Real Madrid haven't beaten local rivals Atletico in six attempts this season. They clash in the first leg of the Champions League last eight on Tuesday. Marcelo says the players are not thinking about their recent record.

Article: (CNN)When Etan Patz went missing in New York City at age 6, hardly anyone in America could help but see his face at their breakfast table. His photo's appearance on milk cartons after his May 1979 disappearance marked an era of heightened awareness of crimes against children. On Friday, more than 35 years after frenzied media coverage of his case horrified parents everywhere, a New York jury will again deliberate over a possible verdict against the man charged in his killing, Pedro Hernandez. He confessed to police three years ago. Etan Patz's parents have waited that long for justice, but some have questioned whether that is at all possible in Hernandez's case. His lawyer has said that he is mentally challenged, severely mentally ill and unable to discern whether he committed the crime or not. Hernandez told police in a taped statement that he lured Patz into a basement as the boy was on his way to a bus stop in Lower Manhattan. He said he killed the boy and threw his body away in a plastic bag. Neither the child nor his remains have ever been recovered. But Hernandez has been repeatedly diagnosed with schizophrenia and has an "IQ in the borderline-to-mild mental retardation range," his attorney Harvey Fishbein has said. Police interrogated Hernandez for 7½ hours before he confessed. "I think anyone who sees these confessions will understand that when the police were finished, Mr. Hernandez believed he had killed Etan Patz. But that doesn't mean he actually did, and that's the whole point of this case," Fishbein has said. But in November, a New York judge ruled that Hernandez's confession and his waiving of his Miranda rights were legal, making the confession admissible in court. Another man's name has also hung over the Patz case for years -- Jose Antonio Ramos, a convicted child molester acquainted with Etan's babysitter. Etan's parents, Stan and Julia Patz, sued Ramos in 2001. The boy was officially declared dead as part of that lawsuit. A judge found Ramos responsible for the boy's death and ordered him to pay the family $2 million -- money the Patz family has never received. Though Ramos was at the center of investigations for years, he has never been charged. He served a 20-year prison sentence in Pennsylvania for molesting another boy and was set to be released in 2012. He was reportedly immediately rearrested upon exiting jail in 2012 on failure to register as a sex offender. Since their young son's disappearance, the Patzes have worked to keep the case alive and to create awareness of missing children in the United States. In the early 1980s, Etan's photo appeared on milk cartons across the country, and news media focused in on the search for him and other missing children. "It awakened America," said Ernie Allen, president and chief executive officer of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. "It was the beginning of a missing children's movement." The actual number of children who were kidnapped and killed did not change -- it's always been a relatively small number -- but awareness of the cases skyrocketed, experts said. But the news industry was expanding to cable television, and sweet images of children appeared along with destroyed parents begging for their safe return. The fear rising across the nation sparked awareness and prompted change from politicians and police. In 1984, Congress passed the Missing Children's Assistance Act, which led to the creation of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. Former President Ronald Reagan opened the center in a White House ceremony in 1984. It soon began operating a 24-hour toll-free hot line on which callers could report information about missing boys and girls. Joe Sterling and CNN's Lorenzo Ferrigno contributed to this report.

Article: Arsene Wenger has branded the emerging trend of post-season tours as a 'nightmare' after revealing Arsenal opted against an extended pre-season trip. Tottenham have confirmed they will travel to Australia and Malaysia at the end of the Premier League season, while Chelsea are also set to travel abroad when the current campaign finishes. Overseas tours are an important component of clubs PR strategies as they look to maximise their earning potential away from England. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has slammed post season tours as a nightmare. Calum Chambers battles with Radamel Falcao during the Emirates Cup pre-season tournament. But they can also cause headaches for managers who feel such tours - particularly pre-season trips - hamper preparations. Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has successfully lobbied for a shorter than anticipated tour of the US this summer. Likewise, Arsenal were exploring the idea of playing additional matches in either India or Malaysia after their initial trip to Singapore - but have decided against it, a decision Wenger is happy with. 'I'm pleased with that because pre-season is always difficult if you cannot prepare well,' said the Arsenal manager. Chelsea are one of several Premier League sides who will be travelling overseas after the season. North London rivals Tottenham will be heading to Australia and Malaysia after the season is done. 'Lets not forget they voted to start early in August next season, which is a bit of nightmare when you think you start on August 8. 'Some players play until June 21 in the Copa America, some in the European Under-21 Championship play until June 14. 'After a season where we have no winter break, I don't see where you go from there to give players a proper rest. It's impossible. 'It is difficult because of the commercial aspect but you want to find a compromise.' Louis van Gaal has successfully lobbied for Manchester United's US tour to be cut short. On the prospect of the Gunners organising a future post-season tour, Wenger, who's side face Burnley on Saturday, added: 'Post season tours are a nightmare - I will never do it. 'In pre-season you have the players under pressure with the focus of starting the season well. 'A post-season tour, I always feel people come along to watch but the players are half on their holidays. 'It is a relaxed atmosphere with none of the intensity of a pre-season game. 'Maybe it is a holiday tour and good to have a relaxed atmosphere together. But from a purely football point of view, there is not much meaning – let’s be honest.'

Article: (The Hollywood Reporter)It may be time to light the lights. ABC is filming a proof of concept for a revival of "The Muppets," The Hollywood Reporter has learned. "The Big Bang Theory" co-creator Bill Prady is co-writing the script for a pilot presentation that sources say could be unspooled at May's upfront presentation to Madison Avenue advertisers. Sources tell THR that the project, if all goes well, could go straight to series. Bob Kushell ("Anger Management," "3rd Rock From the Sun") will also co-write and is attached to serve as showrunner, with Wilfred's Randall Einhorn attached to exec produce and direct the presentation. ABC's "Muppets" revival is being produced by ABC Studios and The Muppet Studios, which Disney owns. The presentation is set to film next weekend on the Disney lot in Burbank with some of the original Muppet performers returning. Sources say the concept for the presentation includes the regular cast of characters created by Jim Henson — Kermit the Frog, Fozzie Bear, Gonzo and Animal, among others — gathering at ABC Studios for a meeting about the new "Muppet Show." However, the show won't move forward unless Miss Piggy signs on, and her current relationship with frequent love Kermit is on the rocks, preventing the show from getting off the ground. Early plans call for two celebrity cameos — including Miss Piggy's current co-star — as well as new roles including Fozzie's girlfriend and her parents. For Prady, the revived "Muppets" — which landed at ABC after initial interest from Netflix — marks a return to his roots. The producer, who currently does not have an overall deal, started his career working for Henson in 1982 and ultimately started writing for "The Jim Henson Hour," remaining on the series until a year after Henson's death in 1990. This marks the second time Prady has attempted to revive "The Muppets." The writer-producer shot some test footage before CBS' "The Big Bang Theory" that Disney ultimately passed on. For his part, Prady earned an Emmy nomination in 1991 for writing tribute "The Muppets Celebrate Jim Henson" in 1990 and has contributed writing to Disney's Muppet-themed attractions. Should ABC order "Muppets" to series, Prady would juggle both that project and CBS' "The Big Bang Theory," which he exec produces. Created in 1955 by Henson, the original Muppet characters appeared on "Sam and Friends" from 1955-61 before going on to appear on late-night talk shows and commercials and becoming a regular part of "Sesame Street" in 1969. "The Muppet Show" launched on its own as a comedy-variety series and ran from 1976-81, with Kermit serving as the de-facto showrunner on the syndicated series that was produced out of the U.K. The franchise has spawned multiple movies (1979's "The Muppet Movie," 1981's "The Great Muppet Caper," 1984's "The Muppets Take Manhattan") as well as NBC's 1989 series "The Jim Henson Hour." Following Henson's death, the franchise continued with "Muppets Tonight" airing on ABC in 1996 with reruns airing on sibling Disney Channel from 1997-2000. That was the last television series to feature the Muppets characters. On the feature side, the franchise featured 1992's "The Muppet Christmas Carol," 1996's "Muppet Treasure Island" and 1999's "Muppets From Space," the latter two of which were co-produced by Disney, who acquired rights to the Muppets in 2004 and formed The Muppets Studio. The company rebranded the franchise in 2008 with Jason Segel's "The Muppets," with an eighth feature in the franchise, "Muppets Most Wanted" bowing in 2014. For ABC, the Muppets revival comes as variety shows are in the midst of a resurgence on the broadcast networks. NBC has made the format a priority, unspooling Marlon Wayans-hosted celebrity variety series "I Can Do That!" in the summer and has Neil Patrick Harris entry "Saturday Night Takeaway" in the works. The decision to revive "The Muppets" also comes as remakes and reboots are having their moment in the sun on the small-screen, as broadcast networks look to fan bases for existing franchises to help cut through the clutter and draw eyeballs in an increasingly crowded scripted space. On the comedy side, "The Muppets" arrives as it has become increasingly challenging to launch original scripted half-hours. Prady is repped by Rothman Brecher and Lichter Grossman; Kushell is with ICM Partners; Einhorn is with WME, Odenkirk Provissiero and Bloom Hergott. ©2015 The Hollywood Reporter. All rights reserved.

Article: Newcastle midfielder Rolando Aarons may have played his last game this season after suffering another injury setback. The 19-year-old was in contention to play for the club's under-21s against Derby on Wednesday evening along with fellow long-term absentee Siem de Jong. However, it is understood he has succumbed to injury once again and it is feared his campaign could be over. Newcastle midfielder Rolando Aarons has suffered another injury setback and may not play again this season. The 19-year-old was in contention to play for the Magpies' Under 21s against Derby on Wednesday. The Magpies declined to comment, but Aarons' loss would be yet another blow to head coach John Carver, who has seen his side defeated in each of its last five Barclays Premier League games amid a suspension and injury crisis which shows few signs of abating. Midfielder Moussa Sissoko was sent off during Monday night's loss at Liverpool to ensure his own enforced spell on the sidelines just as Carver prepares to welcome skipper Fabricio Coloccini back from a three-match ban. Carver can not call on striker Papiss Cisse, who has three more games to serve of his suspension, while Steven Taylor, Paul Dummett, Massadio Haidara, Cheick Tiote, Aarons and De Jong have all been missing for some time with most having kicked their last ball of the campaign. Newcastle had hoped Aarons' pace and direct approach would give them some fresh impetus with their season having careered to a halt in recent weeks. The exciting winger has made only five senior appearances to date this term, the last of them on November 1 when he was used as a first-half substitute in a 1-0 league win over Liverpool at St James' Park.Â. Newcastle midfielder Moussa Sissoko lunges in and makes a terrible tackle on Liverpool midfielder Lucas. Lucas goes down in pain after Sissoko's nasty challenge at Anfield on Monday night.

Article: (CNN)I remember traveling one day in the local train in Mumbai with my mother, my younger sister and brother. The compartment was extremely crowded. As we prepared to disembark, I felt my skirt being lifted and someone groping my private parts. It was terrible. I wanted to scream, but my voice would have drowned in the noise of the crowd. I wanted to push the hands away, but my arms were pinned to my body. I wanted to cry but could only think to myself, "Stop it! Please stop touching me." I was 13 years old. I never told anyone about that day until recently. Twenty-five years later, I continue to hear similar stories of women and girls being harassed on local transportation and other public spaces. The stories can be stomach churning: men masturbating on buses and at bus stops, boys stalking young girls -- both physically and online, men taking pictures of women without permission and uploading them on the Internet. Then there are just the everyday, uncomfortable stares, frequently accompanied by comments with sexual connotations. This isn't all simply anecdotal. A study by We the People found that 80% of women in Mumbai had been street harassed, primarily in crowded areas like trains and railway platforms. Most people, including women, only think of sexual violence as rape and tend to overlook touching, groping and stalking, not to mention the "milder" forms of ogling, leering, catcalling and whistling, even though all of this can be intimidating. Indeed, many women choose to limit their hours outside, select more conservative clothes, or opt for a longer but safer route home. It was only recently that I realized my phobia of trains likely originated with that bad experience I had as a child. I still avoid trains when I can. Most people are silent when inappropriate sexual behavior occurs to women. It was depressing to hear one young college student tell me in a recent sexual harassment workshop I led that "staring and commenting by men is normal and I've learned to ignore it." The reality is that sexual harassment in India is pervasive in all aspects of life. It hits you in the face every day when you walk down the street, take local transport, go about your daily routine or at the workplace. According to U.N. Women's report, 1 in 3 women around the world face some form of sexual violence at least once in their lifetime. This statistic is likely even higher in India. Out of the 2,000 women who have attended workshops I've conducted, only a handful of them have never been at the receiving end of harassment in some setting of their daily lives. Shockingly, less than 10 of them had reported harassment to any official channel. Why are we constantly limiting our options rather than confronting sexual harassment? Over the past two years, I have been working to encourage women to talk about their experiences and realize the tremendous potential power they hold within themselves through acknowledging the problem and being a part of the change to shift the culture around sexual harassment in India. It is not always easy speaking up about sexual harassment. I know firsthand. But acknowledging that it is unacceptable is an important first step. India has laws for sexual violence in public spaces as well as at the workplace, and knowing these rules gives women the power to confront her harasser. But is it enough? Women still have to confront the cultural challenge of not feeling "ashamed" and bringing "disrepute" to their families while overcoming their fear of dealing with the police, who too often file complaints in the wrong categories to reduce the number of official cases on which their performance is judged. However, despite the barriers, two recent cases in India provide proof that even when the perpetrator is in a position of immense power, coming forward to report sexual harassment can make a difference. There is, for example, the young employee from an environmental research organization who alleged that her boss Rajendra Pachauri made unwelcome advances to her through text messages. Her bold and persistent quest for justice resulted in Pachauri stepping down from his position as chair of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Pachauri denied the allegations and insisted his computer and phone were hacked. His counsel stated in court that Pachauri's inbox was not hacked, but he had shared the password with several people who could have sent inappropriate emails to the employee under his name. Similarly, last year, Tarun Tejpal, founder of one of India's leading media companies, was arrested for sexually assaulting his employee in an elevator. She first told her female editor who reportedly did not take her seriously.  She then spoke about it to her male colleagues who encouraged her to report the incident to the police. Tarun Tejpal, who explained the incident as a "bad lapse of judgment," was let out on interim bail while the case is still ongoing. Women have allies -- both male and female -- who are willing to help clear the barriers. Women everywhere just need to find the courage to speak up. The alternative to speaking out is a world where women feel less able to live full lives, restricted and disempowered. We cannot accept harassment as part of our daily routine. We cannot ignore it -- for our own sake and the next generation of women.

Article: Arsene Wenger has challenged his squad to put any dreams of a late charge for the Barclays Premier League to bed and focus instead on the cold reality of winning at Burnley on Saturday. Arsenal head to Turf Moor in search of what would be an eighth straight league victory, following on from last weekend's 4-1 triumph over Liverpool. Despite their superb run, which has seen confidence grow after some 15 wins in the last 17 through all competitions, the title remains Chelsea's to lose, as the leaders currently hold a seven-point advantage and also a match in hand. Nacho Monreal, Theo Walcott, Hector Bellerin and Olivier Giroud appear in good spirits during training. Mesut Ozil shares a joke with Monreal at Arsenal's training HQ while Alexis Sanchez has his shorts rolled up. Santi Cazorla is set to make his 100th Premier League appearance while Abou Diaby is back from injury. While some Gunners fans may have allowed themselves a little bit of fantasy football results over the run-in, which will see Chelsea come to the Emirates Stadium on April 26 and also play both Manchester United and Liverpool, Wenger remains very much focused on the job in hand. 'I have enough experience to know that I have to live with reality and reality is points and the next game,' he said. 'The dreams are for everybody - we all have dreams at night, but when I wake up in the morning I have to come here and make sure we give everything to win the next game.' Wenger continued: 'Chelsea have a difficult schedule, we have a difficult schedule, but what we can only do is master our own schedule. 'What we want is to go as high as we can until the end of the season, give our best and we are also in the semi-final of the FA Cup. 'So we are at an important moment of the Premier League season and it is a period where you show your quality by focusing on the next game and maintain the quality. 'Of course we want to continue to progress and improve - we can learn from victory as well and everything was not perfect in our last game.' Mathieu Flamini, Ozil and Sanchez are pictured at Arsenal's London Colney base on Friday. Laurent Koscielny is put through his paces on Friday as he bids to return to full fitness. Jack Wilshere hasn't played since November but is in line to feature at Burnley on Saturday evening. Arsenal's injury problems look to have finally eased, with midfielders Mikel Arteta, Jack Wilshere and Abou Diaby all having stepped up their rehabilitation from injury, along with full-back Mathieu Debuchy. England international Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, though, continues to be hampered by an inflamed groin, while centre-half Laurent Koscielny will face a fitness test on his thigh problem ahead of Saturday's match. Burnley continue to scrap at the other end of the table, currently second bottom, but only two points from safety. With Manchester City having gone down 1-0 at Turf Moor last month and Tottenham then held to a goalless draw, Wenger is not taking the trip to Lancashire lightly. He said: 'You shouldn't look at the table because they started slowly, but recently they have played very well against all the big teams in the league and are quite efficient at home. 'You have to be at their level of physical performance, because they will be there. 'On the rest, you want to produce the quality of performance that is expected from us on the technical side, but you have first to fight with them physically, that's for sure. 'We have to make sure we produce the expected performance on the commitment, on the focus and on the quality of our game.'

Article: (CNN)Canadian actor Jonathan Crombie, who co-starred in the "Anne of Green Gables" TV movies, died this week at age 48. Crombie died Wednesday from complications of a brain hemorrhage, "Anne of Green Gables" producer Kevin Sullivan said. "It's a real tragedy to see someone at age 48 go like that," he said. "I will remember him as someone who worked extremely hard to make the roles he played onscreen come to life." Based on Canadian author Lucy Maud Montgomery's children's books, "Anne of Green Gables" debuted in Canada on CBC TV in 1984 and became a cultural touchstone. The plot focused on the adventures of fiery orphan Anne Shirley, played by Megan Follows, who is sent to live on a farm in Prince Edward Island. Crombie played Gilbert Blythe, who evolves over time from Anne's pigtail-tugging tormentor to friend to husband. Follows and Crombie reprised the roles in the sequels "Anne of Avonlea" (1987) and "Anne of Green Gables: The Continuing Story" (2000). The movies were carried in the United States by the Disney Channel and PBS, drawing a cult following beyond Canada and extending to Japan, which made its own animated series based on the books. Crombie, son of former Toronto Mayor David Crombie, was cast in the role at 17, beating out other aspiring Canadian actors of the era, including Jason Priestly, Sullivan said. Despite his lack of acting experience, Crombie's boy-next-door looks and cool demeanor made him the perfect actor to star opposite Follows, Sullivan said. "It was an amazing chemistry between him and Megan Follows," Sullivan said. "There was a lot of affection, but they kind of grounded each other." The movies spawned various spinoffs, including "Road to Avonlea," starring child actor Sarah Polley, and turned Anne's fictional home on Prince Edward Island into a popular tourist destination. The role made Crombie a heartthrob of his time, a sentiment expressed by many fans in the wake of his death. As one person said on Twitter, "I don't know any female Canadian from my generation that *didn't* have at least a little bit of a crush on Jonathan Crombie as Gilbert." Crombie went on to play roles in other American and Canadian TV shows, including "21 Jump Street" and "The Good Wife," but even his Facebook page acknowledges he is best known for his portrayal of Gilbert Blythe. Crombie's sister told CBC News that her brother happily answered to the name Gil when greeted by fans in public. "I think he was really proud of being Gilbert Blythe," she said. "He really enjoyed that series and was happy, very proud of it -- we all were." People we've lost in 2015.

Article: Japan's J-League is just four games into a new season, but already the behaviour of its players is hitting the headlines for the wrong reasons after a player appeared to stamp on an opponent's face. Videos of the South Korean defender Kim Min Hyeok, who plays for Sagan Tosu, have gone viral after he allegedly brutally stamped on the face of opponent Mu Kanazaki. Sagan are ninth in the J-League and furious claims have been made that the 23-year-old deliberately committed the horrific foul after being jostled by 11th-placed Kashima Antlers player Kanazaki. Kim Min Hyeok (left) and Mu Kanazaki (right) fight it out for the ball on the wing during a J-League clash. After Kanazaki went down, it is alleged that Hyeok stamped down on the face of his fallen opponent. Despite the vicious looking nature of Hyeok’s apparent attack and Kanazaki’s dramatic clutch to his face, the defender only received a yellow card and was allowed to play on, much to the fans' uproar. Whether or not the foul was intentional, it is suspected that the reason for Japanese  fans’ outcry is not so much the act itself, but the fact that it was committed by a South Korean player. Hyeok's boot appears to scrape down Kanazaki's face, but the man on the floor came out as the winner later. Hyeok was somehow only shown a yellow card for the challenge that infuriated fans at the stadium. Some Japanese fans have demanded not only the expulsion of Hyeok, but of all South Koreans, from the game. However, regardless of the controversy, justice - to some extent - was served when the supposed stamped-on player’s team won 3-1, with Kanazaki among the goals.

Article: (CNN)This week's attack on Garissa University College is Al-Shabaab's fifth major assault in Kenya in the past year and a half. The Thursday massacre was the most deadly assault so far, with 147 dead, easily eclipsing the terrorist group's most notorious attack, a four-day siege in late September 2013 at the Westgate Mall in Nairobi in which 67 people were killed. After the Westgate attack, Al-Shabaab unleashed a string of attacks in Kenya that have killed more than 100 people -- assaulting the coastal town of Mpeketoni on June 16, 2014; shooting bus passengers who could not recite the Quran on November 22, 2014; and then, days later, executing Christian quarry laborers. Why is Al-Shabaab, a Somali nationalist, Islamist group affiliated with al Qaeda, targeting Kenya? Al-Shabaab says its attacks are to protest the more than 3,500 Kenyan soldiers participating in the African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia. But if that is the case, why doesn't Al-Shabaab target Kenyan military bases rather than attacking undefended so-called soft targets such as Kenyan malls and universities? In fact, Thursday's attack on the university is one more sign of the weakness of Al-Shabaab, which has steadily been losing ground for years in Somalia as a result of the African Union forces fighting them there, as well as a covert U.S. drone and Special Operations Forces campaign that has also degraded the group's capabilities. In 2006, Al-Shabaab controlled the Somali capital of Mogadishu and, in the following years, much of central and southern Somalia. Six years later, African Union forces had recaptured Mogadishu, parts of southern Somalia and critical cities such as Kismayo. The loss of Kismayo, Al-Shabaab's last city stronghold and an important port, took a financial toll on the group. Ground battles with African Union forces have decimated Al-Shabaab's rank-and-file, while U.S. drone strikes and Special Operations raids have killed some of the group's leaders. In the past four years, according to a count by New America, the U.S. has launched a dozen drone strikes and six Special Operations raids against Al-Shabaab. These strikes and raids -- almost all occurring in southern Somalia -- have targeted the terrorist group's training camps and leaders. American drones or special operators have killed 10 leaders: Aden Hashi Ayro, the top commander; Ahmed Abdi Godane, Ayro's successor; a top commander, Sheikh Muhidin Mohamud Omar; Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan, a senior official who operated training camps; commander Jabreel Malik Muhammed; Bilal al-Berjawi, the deputy of military leader Fazul Abdullah Mohammed; chief bomb-maker Ibrahim Ali Abdi; intelligence chief Tahlil Abdishakur; Yusef Dheeq, the chief of external operations and planning for intelligence and security; and Adan Garar, who was involved in planning the Westgate Mall attack. Al-Shabaab has been unraveling for years. Thursday's attack should remind the world that the group is a pale shadow of the organization that once dominated much of Somalia but now is reduced to high profile attacks against undefended civilian targets.​.

Article: Brendan Rodgers is considering recalling £20million misfit defender Dejan Lovren at Blackburn in the FA Cup on Wednesday to help save Liverpool’s season. The trip to Ewood Park for a quarter-final replay has even more significance as in comes in the wake of successive morale-sapping Premier League defeats by Manchester United and Arsenal. Saturday’s 4-1 loss at the Emirates was marked by the kind of shaky defending that blighted Liverpool’s early-season play. Brendan Rodgers is ready to recall his out-of-favour defender Dejan Lovren for the FA Cup quarter-final. Lovren has been out of the Liverpool team recently, but could return against Blackburn on Wednesday. Now — with Emre Can and Martin Skrtel both suspended — Rodgers is set to bring in Lovren after opting for veteran Kolo Toure ahead of him at the weekend. ‘Kolo gives everything every single day so I knew what I would get with him at Arsenal,” said Rodgers. ‘Dejan was out over the international break but he is looking strong. He will be in contention.’ Lovren has made only 16 league starts since he was signed last summer from Southampton but the Croatian may have to step up as Rodgers sticks with the three-man defensive system that helped turn around Liverpool’s season in December. Kolo Toure was given a torrid time by Arsenal as he reutrned in the place of suspended Martin Skrtel. Rodgers says he knows what to expect from Toure, but could turn to Lovren for the must-win game. Liverpool were thrashed 4-1 by Arsenal, and now the FA Cup represents their last chance for a good season.

Article: Los Angeles (CNN)Former rap mogul Marion "Suge" Knight was ordered Thursday to stand trial for murder and other charges stemming from a deadly hit-and-run confrontation on the movie set of the biopic "Straight Outta Compton" earlier this year. In addition to that ruling, Judge Ronald Coen also lowered Knight's bail to $10 million from $25 million, a figure that defense lawyers called excessive. The judge also dismissed one of the two counts of hit-and-run against Knight. In all, Knight will stand trial on one count of murder, one count of attempted murder and one count of hit-and-run, the judge ruled after holding a two-day preliminary hearing this week that ended Thursday. Knight, 49, faces up to life in prison if convicted. Knight suffers diabetes and blot clots, and the case has clearly strained him: He collapsed in court last month after learning of the $25 million bail and he was taken to the hospital for treatment. Knight was in court Thursday. At the end of hearing, he turned around and looked at his family in the gallery, and he smiled to his fiancee as deputies led him handcuffed out of the courtroom. In a press conference after the hearing, fiancee Toi Kelly said regarding Knight's health that he is "doing much better." The judge dismissed the other hit-and-run count because California law says no more than one charge of hit-and-run should be brought against a defendant when the same weapon, in this case the vehicle Knight was driving, is used against several people. Knight is accused of running over two men, killing one of them, during an argument. Killed was Terry Carter, 55. The survivor is Cle Sloan, 51, who in testimony this week declined to identify Knight as his attacker because Sloan doesn't want to be a "snitch" who sends Knight to prison, according to CNN affiliates KABC and KTLA. Prosecutors offered Sloan immunity, but he still refused to testify against Knight on Monday, the affiliates reported. The deadly incident happened on January 29, after a flare-up on the set of the biopic "Straight Outta Compton," a film about the highly influential and controversial rap group N.W.A. The alleged argument spilled over to the parking lot of Tam's Burgers in Compton. At the time, Knight was out on bail in a separate robbery case. The hit-and-run was captured on videotape and allegedly shows Knight inside a red truck. In the video, the truck pulls into the entrance of the Compton restaurant, and he is then approached by Sloan, who was working security on the site. The two men appear to talk for a few moments, with Knight still in his vehicle. Suddenly, the vehicle backs up, knocking Sloan to the ground. While still in reverse, the truck moves out of range of the security camera. The vehicle is then seen zooming forward, back into camera range, running over Sloan a second time, and then running over a second man, Carter, a former rap music label owner. Carter later died. In closing arguments prior to the judge's ruling, Knight's attorney Matthew Fletcher argued that Knight was the victim. Knight was only defending himself against Sloan, whom the defense attorney accused of possessing a gun at the time. "Mr. Sloan is the initial and consistent aggressor," Knight's attorney argued. "There's no intent to kill, there's an intent to survive." "Even without a gun, we know Mr. Sloan was brave enough to attack in broad daylight," the defense attorney said. Fletcher added that Knight's defense was to stand his ground. Sloan "needed immunity because he was the actual aggressor," Fletcher said. "He is the person who got Terry (Carter) killed." Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Cynthia Barnes argued, however, told the judge that Knight was engaged in "mutual combat situation" where he used his car as deadly weapon. If Knight "ever had the right of self-defense, the moment he backed-up and Mr. Sloan was ran-over, he lost the right of self-defense," Barnes said. "There was pre-mediation and intent when he (Knight) ran over him a second time." Knight is scheduled to be arraigned on April 30. The incident is the latest run-in with the law for Knight, who founded the wildly successful Death Row Records in 1991 and signed artists such as Snoop Doggy Dogg (now known as Snoop Lion) and Tupac Shakur. Knight was driving the car in which Shakur was a passenger when the rapper was shot to death in Las Vegas in 1996. Shortly afterward, Knight spent several years in prison for violating parole on assault and weapons convictions. That prison time -- along with Shakur's death, feuds between Knight and a number of rappers, and desertions by Dr. Dre, Snoop and others -- contributed to the label's bankruptcy in 2006. In August, Knight and two other people were shot while inside a celebrity-filled Sunset Strip party hosted by singer Chris Brown on the eve of the MTV Video Music Awards.

Article: The thermometer reading Mario Balotelli shared on social media to prove he was too ill to play against Blackburn on Wednesday night will make no difference to Brendan Rodgers. Liverpool’s manager had already gone cold on the Italian, concluding some time ago that he has no future at Anfield. Rodgers will admit he ignored the warnings about Balotelli. He knew Jose Mourinho considered him ‘unmanageable’ and he listened to the anecdotal evidence he received from the members of his staff who had encountered the troublesome striker during their time at Manchester City. But Rodgers rather hoped Balotelli might be maturing with age, and he made the mistake of thinking he could succeed where others had failed in actually getting through to him. Mario Balotelli has no future at Liverpool after manager Brendan Rodgers lost patience with the striker. Rodgers will admit he ignored the warning signs but had hoped Balotelli was maturing as he got older. Balotelli shared an image of a thermometer reading to prove he was too ill to play against Blackburn. Liverpool’s manager was desperate too, of course. Attempts to recruit other strikers, in particular Alexis Sanchez, had proved unsuccessful last summer and he was concerned that Rickie Lambert would not provide ample cover in a Champions League season if Daniel Sturridge suffered further injury problems. He was right to worry about Sturridge’s physical fragility but wrong, he would probably now concede, to spend £16million on Balotelli. For three hours in his office at Melwood he attempted to lessen the risk before asking his employers to part with the money. He spoke both to Balotelli and his agent, explaining what was expected of every Liverpool player and sharing his philosophy on the power of the collective. Over the years his C.O.R.E principles speech – Commitment. Ownership. Responsibilities. Excellence – had worked with players. He would use a flip-chart to deliver his lecture on the standards he demands and, for the most part, players had responded accordingly. But not Balotelli. Not the player who already had a reputation for having no respect for authority, for his considerable talent or for the clubs he represents. Liverpool missed out on Alexis Sanchez last summer and instead paid £16m to sign Balotelli from AC Milan. Balotelli has endured a torrid time at Anfield and has managed to score just once in the Premier League. Rodgers is saddened by the fact Italy international Balotelli appears to have no respect for Liverpool. Crystal Palace (A) Lost 3-1, November 23, 2014 Reason: Hamstring and groin injuries. Ludogorets (A) Drew 2-2, November 26, 2014 Reason: Hamstring and groin injuries. Stoke (H) Won 1-0, November 29, 2014 Reason: Hamstring and groin injuries. Leicester (A) Won 1-3, December 2, 2014 Reason: Hamstring and groin injuries. Sunderland (H) Drew 0-0, December 6, 2014 Reason: Hamstring and groin injuries. Basle (H) Drew 1-1, December 9, 2014 Reason: Hamstring and groin injuries. Bournemouth (A) Won 3-1, December 17, 2014 Reason: Groin injury. Arsenal (H) Drew 2-2, December 21, 2014 Reason: One-match ban. Leicester (H) Drew 2-2, January 1, 2015 Reason: Not selected. Aston Villa (A) Won 2-0, January 17, 2015 Reason: Illness. Chelsea (H) Drew 1-1, Januray 20, 2015 Reason: Illness. Bolton (H) Drew 0-0, January 24, 2015 Reason: Not selected. West Ham (H) Won 2-0, January 31, 2015 Reason: Not selected. Bolton (A) Won 2-1, February 4, 2015 Reason: Not selected. Everton (A) Drew 0-0, February 7, 2015 Reason: Not selected. Swansea (A) Won 1-0, March 16, 2015 Reason: Illness. Arsenal (A) Lost 4-1, April 4, 2015 Reason: Knee injury. Blackburn (A) Won 1-0, April 8, 2015 Reason: Illness. Rodgers is saddened by the fact that Balotelli appears to have no respect for Liverpool, and no apparent willingness to even follow the simplest instructions. In Sturridge’s absence Rodgers told Balotelli he needed a striker who would ‘press’ at the point of Liverpool’s attack; who would play high up the field and in so doing set the pattern of Liverpool’s play. Balotelli, much to his manager’s frustration, just wouldn’t do it, in the misguided belief that he knew better. On the training field there have been similar issues; a situation that has offended team-mates who do buy into Rodgers’ methods and want to build on the success they enjoyed last season. So there will be no second chance for Balotelli at Liverpool next season; no opportunity to redeem himself. Rodgers is continuing to use him when absolutely necessary but he is at the very top of a list of players he will be putting up for sale this summer. He has to get him out and put what money he can recover for him to better use, if only to improve morale in a dressing room that probably lost patience with the guy before even he did. Liverpool players are offended Balotelli has not followed simple instructions from his manager this season.

Article: (CNN)Can you imagine paying $1,000 a month in rent to live in a one-car garage?  Nicole, a 30-year-old woman, doesn't have to imagine this scenario because it's her everyday reality.  The small and unusual living space is all that this employed, single mother can afford in her high-cost community in San Mateo, California. Nicole isn't alone in her struggles. CNN recently published a powerful piece called "Poor kids of Silicon Valley" that documents the affordable housing challenges facing families in the Bay Area.  One aspect featured a house that is home to 16 people, including 11 children.  Another chronicles a husband and wife named Rich and Stacey, both of whom have jobs, who are living in a San Jose homeless shelter with their two kids because they don't have the money to go anywhere else. Although Silicon Valley has unique characteristics, it isn't the only community confronting these challenges.  Our entire nation is in the midst of an affordable housing crisis.  The agency I lead, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, recently released a report estimating that 7.7 million low-income households live in substandard housing, spend more than half their incomes on rent or both. These are families who are dedicating $1 out of every $2 they earn just to keep a roof over their head.  And the more they spend on housing, the less they have to invest in their children's education, build up savings and shop at local businesses.  These are outcomes that hurt our nation's economy and require us to respond with swift and bold action. HUD is working with local partners across the country to do just that. First, we're focusing on preserving the affordable housing that already exists. Since the mid-1970s, we have directed and insured loans for multifamily properties that have resulted in more than 700,000 affordable units.  But by 2020, we're in danger of losing more than 125,000 because these mortgages are maturing, ending agreements to control rents in these units.  So we've launched a preservation effort with private partners to keep these properties affordable for generations to come. We're also doing the same with public housing. Right now, the nation is losing 10,000 units of public housing every year, mainly because of disrepair, HUD created the Rental Assistance Demonstration  initiative to bring private investment into the fold for the public good. It's cost neutral for the federal government and making a big impact for communities such as Lexington, North Carolina, where the local housing authority is making 58 years' worth of repairs in just 22 months, including new lighting, modern windows and better insulation to help residents stay warm and cut energy costs. RAD has allowed local communities to raise more than $733 million in new capital to date. That's why we're asking Congress to give every community the chance to participate by lifting the restrictions on this program. No American should ever have to wait six decades to have a decent and healthy place to call home. In addition to preservation, HUD is also working to create new affordable housing.  A Harvard study revealed that in 2012, there were 11.5 million extremely low-income households and only 3.3 million affordable units available.  It's clear that we can't preserve our way out of this problem.  We've got to grow the supply to meet demand, so HUD is taking a multifaceted approach. For example, our HOME Investment Partnerships Program is leveraging $4 in private and other public resources for every $1 in HOME funds and leading to more than 1 million new and rehabilitated units for rent or sale to lower income families. This is more than just a statistic: It is progress for people, from the families living in the Broadway Crossing development in Washington to the seniors living in the Woodcrest Retirement Residence in Pennsylvania.  To keep this momentum going, we've asked Congress to increase HOME funding by 16% to keep building affordable homes, prosperous partnerships and strong communities across the nation. We are also asking Congress to expand our Housing Choice Voucher Program, which allows recipients of modest means, the elderly, and people with disabilities to find housing in the private market.  This includes restoring 67,000 vouchers that were lost to sequestration. And we're targeting our resources where they can have a big impact. For instance, HUD awarded $94 million in targeted homelessness assistance to 274 programs across the San Francisco Bay Area, including Silicon Valley, in January.  And we continue to work with local partners to encourage private investment. To empower communities, President Barack Obama has also requested $300 million for new Local Housing Policy Grants to help them increase housing affordability, economic growth and access to jobs. All of this work is making a significant contribution to families and communities from coast-to-coast. Our nation's affordable housing challenges won't be solved overnight, and we still need to do more to make sure that more folks are able to prosper. Let's not squander this chance to make real progress for American families. Incredible things can happen when a wide variety of leaders come together for the common good. By leveraging private investment and increasing collaboration with state, local and tribal governments and other traditional housing partners, I know we can build a future where affordable housing is available to all.

The article discusses the affordable housing crisis in the US, particularly in Silicon Valley, where families are struggling to find affordable housing, and highlights HUD's efforts to address the issue through preservation, creation, and expansion of affordable housing

Article: Amir Khan believes Kell Brook has called him out so that he can have the 'one big payday' which has so far eluded him during his 10-and-a-half year career. Brook, who defeated Jo Jo Dan to retain his IBF welterweight title last month, immediately challenged Khan in a post-fight interview but the Bolton-born boxer has instead agreed a bout on May 30, with his opponent yet to be confirmed. Khan has reiterated his intention to take on Brook within the next 12 months, although he insists that the undefeated 28-year-old only wants the fight because of the money it will earn him. Amir Khan (left), pictured during his last fight against Devon Alexander, has blasted Kell Brook's motives. Brook (right) shakes hands with British Superbike champion Shane Byrne at Donington Park on Tuesday. In an interview with iFL TV, Khan said: 'He's only faced one decent opponent in his whole career, so he has no room to talk. It seems to me that he's just calling me out for that one big payday. 'If he keeps going on like this, that one big payday fight for him will never happen because at the end of the day, he's just trying to win fans over by mentioning my name when he knows that I can't fight then because of Ramadan. 'And he's putting down my opponents, who are still better opponents than his opponents, like Jo Jo Dan, who should be called No No Dan, to be honest with you, because end of day, he's not done anything in his career.' Khan had announced a fight with Chris Algieri next month but he has now backtracked on that, claiming that there are'some more options on the table'. Khan has now denied that he will face Chris Algieri next month, claiming there are'some more options' Chris Algieri lost every round to Manny Pacquiao when he took on the Filipino star last November. Brook is desperate to fight Khan but his fellow Brit rejected the chance to face him at Wembley in June. A £5million clash with Brook at Wembley on June 13 was also an option but Khan rejected the offer as he will not fight during Ramadan because of his Islamic faith. He added: 'Like I said, this Algieri fight, if it happens, it's making me a lot of money; money that Kell Brook's not seen. That's why he's probably dying. Amir's making millions when he's not even seen his first million. 'There's classes in boxing. There's fighters in boxing who are the A-class fighters, the likes of Manny Pacquiao and Mayweather, who talk about and mention and say they know who Amir Khan is. 'When it comes to Kell Brook, who knows Kell Brook in America? Which fighter, apart from Shawn Porter, knows Kell Brook? Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao don't know who Kell Brook is, so I don't know what he's going on about trying to say he's a big name. 'Kell Brook's going on like he's the next guy to fight Mayweather when he's not even a big ticket seller. He might be big in his own backyard in Sheffield, but other than Sheffield, no-one knows him. Brook is hoping to fight Khan within the next 12 months as he looks to extend his unbeaten streak. Khan claims that Brook is not even a big name in the UK and is not able to face the world's biggest names. 'The way he's tried to come across to the US public is like he's a super-big name in the UK. He's not a big name in the UK.' And Khan insists that he is not avoiding Brook, even though the fight will be of greater benefit to the Sheffield-born star. 'Look, do I need the fight against Kell Brook?,' said Khan. 'I make a lot of money regardless if I fight Kell Brook. 'I will make a lot of money in this sport and I've made a lot of money in this sport of boxing. Kell Brook needs me to make that big money. 'Without me, he'll never make that big money unless he goes out and fights the top guys like Pacquiao, Mayweather, and Marquez, but I can't see him fighting those guys because he's always scared to get beat by them and lose his title.'

Amir Khan has rejected a £5million fight with Kell Brook in June. Khan claims that Brook only wants to fight him for 'one big payday' Brook will struggle to fight one of boxing's big names, according to Khan.

Article: (CNN)A jury of Rolling Stone's media peers has dissected the magazine's disastrous, discredited story about rape on the campus of the University of Virginia, and the emerging consensus is that Rolling Stone's lapses and sloppy blunders amount to journalistic malpractice -- made all the worse by the magazine's head-in-the sand reaction to the thorough, devastating report released by a panel of investigators from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. Rolling Stone's egregious mistakes of reporting and editing are regrettable but understandable. The magazine's decision not to fire anybody or reorganize its newsroom operation is not. Before the original story, "A Rape on Campus," was pulled from the Rolling Stone website, it registered 2.7 million hits following its publication in November -- more than any noncelebrity story in the magazine's history. An anonymous undergraduate, given the name "Jackie," told Rolling Stone writer Sabrina Rubin Erdely she had been invited to a party thrown by Phi Kappa Psi fraternity in 2012 -- only to end up beaten and gang-raped by seven boys, who were allegedly coached along in the attack by the same student, a casual acquaintance, who had invited Jackie to the party. The horrific allegations sparked protests against the fraternity,  a police investigation, the temporary suspension of all fraternities at the school and a nationwide debate about the prevalence of sexual violence on college campuses. But the story began to unravel almost immediately when Washington Post reporter T. Rees Shapiro took a closer look, leading Rolling Stone to back away from the story and request a review by the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. That review, which is considerably longer than the original article, reveals startling lapses in basic journalistic practice. Rolling Stone writer Erdely never verified the identity of the attacker and therefore never confronted him with the allegations; she never spoke to three of Jackie's friends who allegedly talked with Jackie immediately after the attack, and she never gave the fraternity a fair chance to respond, refusing to provide specific information about what happened and when. And at every step of the way, when Jackie began acting flaky -- refusing to provide basic information needed to verify her story or vanishing for weeks at a time without returning calls from the reporter -- neither Erdely nor her editors or the magazine's fact checkers made the hard but necessary decision to hit the pause button and decline to run the story. Having worked part time as a journalism professor for a decade (including one semester at Columbia), I would agree with colleagues who call Rolling Stone's lapses the kind that would be unacceptable in a freshman classroom. I've told students for years: You should never print allegations without giving people a fair chance to respond. And you should never take a source's word about important facts without verifying the truth. (There's a reason we call it reporting and not dictation.) Most of all, I tell students, remember that you're writing about human beings, who are complicated creatures: The good guys are never all that good, and the bad guys usually aren't completely bad. People can be mistaken or deceitful, I tell young reporters, they frequently forget and often lie to themselves. That doesn't make a source useless, but it must make you extra careful. Unfortunately, the early word from Rolling Stone is that they've absorbed none of these lessons. Publisher Jann Wenner has apparently decided not to fire, demote or discipline anybody at Rolling Stone, provoking expressions of disbelief among seasoned journalists. "No one fired at Rolling Stone. Really?" wrote CNN media critic Brian Stelter. "What would Rolling Stone in its heyday write about an institution that screwed up unbelievably, damaged people's lives, but punished no one?" tweeted John Bresnahan, the Capitol bureau chief of Politico. "Rolling Stone outsources its investigation to Columbia and proceeds to do nothing in terms of individual accountability afterward? OK...," tweeted pundit Joe Concha. Worse still, the editors who committed the blunder seem unprepared to revamp their operation to prevent a repeat of the debacle, framing the error as an earnest but misguided attempt to believe the word of a sexual assault victim. "Rolling Stone's senior editors are unanimous in the belief that the story's failure does not require them to change their editorial systems," the Columbia report says. And check out this amazing conclusion from Will Dana, the managing editor who presided over the disaster. Dana told the Columbia team: "It's not like I think we need to overhaul our process, and I don't think we need to necessarily institute a lot of new ways of doing things. We just have to do what we've always done and just make sure we don't make this mistake again." That smug attitude pretty much ensures Rolling Stone's newsroom managers will commit another goof in the future. At a minimum, they should heed the wise counsel of my friend Bill Grueskin, an executive editor at Bloomberg who formerly served as dean of academic affairs at the Columbia J-school. "When doing big, investigative stories, reporters face many challenges: recalcitrant sources, complex numbers, buried records. Editors, whose labors are usually cloaked in anonymity, are spared most of those hurdles. But they face their own internal newsroom challenges, particularly when handling a potential blockbuster story," Grueskin writes. "They must keep their star reporters happy, trim verbiage that interrupts the narrative, and deal with the expectations of bosses hungry for prizes and traffic." The problem could be, says Grueskin, that Rolling Stone had too many chefs in the kitchen, instead of "a single, talented editor with an intact set of vertebrae." Until Wenner and his team learn that basic lesson -- and revamp their hiring, editing and fact-checking process accordingly -- the Rolling Stone fiasco will eventually be followed by another, one made less forgivable because we all saw it coming.

Article: Ander Herrera has caught the eye in recent weeks after cementing a spot in Manchester United's starting line-up but it appears he does not actually have a clear sight at goal. Herrera netted a brace against Aston Villa on Saturday afternoon without actually looking at Brad Guzan's goal as his eyes appeared to be shut when making contact with the ball. In fact, six of Herrera's seven goals have been scored without him even having to glimpse at either the ball or the opposition's net. Manchester United star Ander Herrera scores his side's opening goal against Aston Villa with his eyes shut. The Spanish midfielder appears to have his eyes closed as he strikes at Brad Guzan's goal. Aston Villa and England midfielder Fabian Delph attempts to block Herrera's left-footed shot. His eyes were wide open when he struck an impressive first-time shot against Yeovil in the third round of the FA Cup back in January. However his double against Aston Villa and his goals against Queens Park Rangers, Leicester, Preston and Swansea all came without Manchester United's summer signing having to make eye contact with the ball. Herrera appears to have a history of shooting with his eyes closed as the image of his goal for Spain's Under 20 side back in 2009 shows. Herrera hits the back of the net while representing Spain's Under 20 side against Tahiti. The former Athletic Bilbao joined the Red Devils for £29million in the summer due to his vision and creativity in midfield. Louis van Gaal heaped praise on the 25-year-old's shooting ability after Saturday's Premier League encounter at Old Trafford, by stating: 'He has a very good kicking technique and he should be more composed,' Van Gaal said to MUTV. 'I said to him 'you have to control the ball before you shoot'. 'I said that to him again in yesterday's training session, and then I kissed him at half-time because he had controlled the ball for the first time in his life and then he shot.' Herrera's eyes were also shut for Manchester United's third goal against Aston Villa on Saturday. His only Manchester United goal scored with his eyes wide open came against Yeovil Town back in January. Herrera scored in Manchester United's 4-0 win over Queens Park Rangers without looking at the ball. The former Athletic Bilbao man flicked the ball past Preston's players without having his eyes on the ball. Herrera scored in Manchester United's 2-1 defeat by Swansea City at the Liberty Stadium in February. He also netted in Manchester United's shock 5-3 defeat at the hands of Premier League strugglers Leicester.

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence.
Ander Herrera has scored seven goals for Man United since joining in June. Herrera's eyes have been shut when striking the ball for six of his goals. His superb strike against Yeovil Town has been only goal with eyes open. Herrera netted a brace in Manchester United's 3-1 win over Aston Villa.

Article: (CNN)Duckie's still got moves. On Tuesday night's "Late Late Show" on CBS, actor Jon Cryer reprised the character's record-store dance to Otis Redding's "Try a Little Tenderness," right down to the wall-dancing, the counter-bashing and, of course, the trademark white shoes. In the original scene, one of the best-loved bits from the 1986 John Hughes film, Cryer dances around a record store, lip-syncing the song as he tries to win the affection of Molly Ringwald's Andie. In Tuesday's recreation, he dances in tandem with host James Corden, who tweeted that he'd "fulfilled a childhood dream" by re-creating the scene with Cryer -- who turned 50 on Thursday. "I watched that 'Try a Little Tenderness' dance routine so many times, the tape on the VHS wore out," Corden said on the show. Like Cryer, who has most recently appeared on "Two and a Half Men," many of the film's original fans are well into middle age. But still some may have squealed like teenagers when they saw the routine.

Article: Jenson Button believes McLaren now have their rivals in their sights ahead of this weekend's Chinese Grand Prix. After starting the new Formula One season in Australia with a severe lack of pace, McLaren and new power-unit supplier Honda made significant progress a fortnight later in Malaysia. Although both Button and team-mate Fernando Alonso retired during the race at the Sepang International Circuit, the duo at least discovered the car was competitive alongside other midfield runners. Jenson Button looks on in the garage during final practice for last month's Malaysian Grand Prix. That came as a pleasant surprise to Button, who is now hoping further steps have been taken going into this weekend's race in Shanghai. 'Obviously we want to finish a race, but seeing improvement in pace was much more important,' said Button. 'Yes, we both had failures, but I'd rather that with us pushing and trying to get more power out of the car than trotting around at the back and simply getting to the end. 'To be able to race other cars, and see the Red Bulls until a long way into the race, was good. 'We would probably have been 20 seconds behind them. I know they're not quick, but that is a good step forward for us. Button returns to the McLaren garage after retiring during the race at the Sepang circuit. 'Right now we're comparing ourselves with the Force Indias, Saubers and Lotuses. 'We were quicker than Force India; the Sauber was on the same sort of pace, and the Lotus wasn't that much quicker. 'Fighting with the pack is important for me. It's what I enjoy and hopefully race by race we'll start picking them off.' Despite the positives, Button acknowledges the entire team, including Honda,'still has a long way to go'. British driver Button in action before he retired from the Malaysian Grand Prix. Button added: 'We need and want more downforce to fight with the guys around us, and we still have a lot to do with the power unit, but our basic car is good. 'If you look at our high-speed pace, compared to the Force India and Sauber, then we are much stronger. 'So we're moving in the right direction, and I'm already surprised we are racing cars. It's great to see.' Part of the reasoning behind McLaren's improvement in Malaysia, in comparison to Australia, was the high temperatures which suited the car. McLaren driver Fernando Alonso (left) drives ahead of team-mate Button in Kuala Lumpur. Button appreciates the cooler air in Shanghai could have an effect. The 35-year-old said: 'There is a feeling the expected cooler weather will make it harder to generate tyre temperature. 'That could mean any progress we make doesn't necessarily translate to a lap-time benefit. 'But there is definitely progress being made, and it's great to be able to play a role in helping move the whole team forwards. 'It'll be fascinating to see how much change we can effect over the forthcoming races.'

Jenson Button and Fernando Alonso both retired in Malaysia last month. Button says, however, that McLaren are moving in the right direction. The Chinese Grand Prix takes place in Shanghai this weekend.

Article: (CNN)The public outrage over the "religious freedom" bills recently passed in Arkansas and Indiana caught the governors of those states completely off-guard, judging by their confused and contradictory responses. As poll watchers, they surely knew that most Americans now oppose the discriminatory laws and practices they accepted as normal only a dozen years ago. But the politicians underestimated the pushback organized by local and national businesses, including companies with no previous record of public support for social equality. They had better adjust to a new reality. For the past three decades, socially conservative evangelicals and pro-business interests have been powerfully allied against government regulations, environmental initiatives and social welfare programs, while supporting lower taxes for the wealthy and pushing back against the growing diversity in America's population. For many, this alliance been puzzling: Other, equally devout Christians who place more emphasis on Jesus Christ's message of unconditional love and on his denunciations of excessive wealth and neglect of the poor, have been uncomfortable with it, as have many business leaders. Their priorities, after all, are based on the bottom line. And companies that sell goods and services to the public are learning that support for discrimination -- or even passive acceptance of it -- threatens that bottom line. Hence, after Indiana Gov. Mike Pence signed a law that opened a new door for discrimination against same-sex couples, the threat of boycotts and other retaliation was swift, from groups as diverse as the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the Indiana Pacers, Walmart, Eli Lilly, Apple and even the Marriott International hotel chain. Marriott International was founded by J.W. Marriott, a dedicated Mormon, and is now run by his son Bill, also a Mormon who fully accepts his church's teachings about traditional marriage.  Yet in June, Marriott International launched a "#Love Travels" marketing campaign, aimed at attracting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender travelers with an assurance of "the company's commitment to make everyone feel comfortable about who they are." Asked about the discrepancy between his religious rejection of same-sex marriage and his marketing overtures to same-sex honeymooners, Marriott pointed to the Bible's injunction of unconditional love, but added "beyond that, I am very careful about separating my personal faith and beliefs from how we run our business." In 2014, global spending by LGBT travelers was estimated at more than $200 billion, and spending by this market segment is rising much faster than overall spending on travel. So Marriott worries when states start to make such travelers feel unwelcome. Businesses seeking to develop brand loyalty among younger consumers have a special incentive to highlight their rejection of anti-gay bias.  A CNN poll taken in February found that 72% of millennials nationwide believe that same-sex couples have the right to have their marriages recognized as valid.  Even among white evangelical Protestants, 43% of millennials support same-sex marriage, compared with less than 20% of those their grandparents' age, 68 and older. It used to be that businesses could close their eyes to discrimination in areas geographically isolated from the more liberal coasts, but that is no longer possible. According to researchers for MTV's "Look Different" anti-bias campaign, 90% of youths aged 14 to 24 agree that it is important to make their communities a less biased place, and almost 80% say that everyone has a responsibility to help tackle bias. So who's the "moral majority" now? For media-savvy millennials, following that moral imperative means spreading the news about discrimination wherever it occurs and reaching beyond geographic boundaries to mobilize against it. In the first 24 hours after Arkansas passed its version of the "religious freedom" bill, the Twitter hashtag #BoycottArkansas was used 12,000 times. It then snowballed after celebrity blogger Perez Hilton tweeted it to his 5.9 million Twitter followers. America has crossed a threshold where it is no longer a good business model or political strategy to be intolerant of diversity, whether that pertains to race, ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation. Since 2011, the majority of children that have been born in the United States each year are members of racial or ethnic minorities.  Hispanics are projected to account for most of the growth in the labor force between now and 2060. Women now lead men in educational attainment. And more than half of Americans live in states where same-sex marriage is legal. Business leaders and politicians who ignore or offend these constituencies do so at their own peril.

Article: (CNN)Editor's Note: Ines Dumig was recently announced as a CENTER Grant Recipient. Sahra, a Somali refugee, left her home at 14 years old. Throughout her journey in search of asylum, she managed to overcome dangers and discomforts. But she never gave up, and she continuously reminded herself to keep going. She's the focus of Ines Dumig's photo series "Apart Together." Dumig met Sahra through a photo workshop at Refugio, a shelter in Munich, Germany, for refugees and torture victims. What drew Dumig to Sahra specifically was her strength and her ability to effectively reflect on all of her experiences. "It really impressed me how she deals with everything," Dumig said. "She's strong in her way of connecting with the culture here and also reflecting on what happened, the culture where she comes from." The number of refugees seeking asylum in the European Union increased by 25% last year, with Germany receiving the most applications. One of the reasons Dumig decided to photograph Sahra is because growing up in Germany made Dumig realize that she lived a fortunate lifestyle. Another reason has to do with Dumig's interest in people's emotions and finding one's identity. "I realized so many people want to come to Europe, and I always had the feeling to disappear or to go away," Dumig said. "Seeing how people live in other parts of the world made me realize how privileged I am." "Apart Together" serves not only as a documentation of Sahra, but as a far-reaching story about people from all backgrounds. The title of Dumig's work refers to the fact that although people may be physically apart from one another, the comparable feelings they experience are what link all people together. "Sometimes we feel strong, sometimes we feel lost -- that's kind of universal, I think," Dumig said. "That's why I want to universalize (Sahra's) story as well, not only make it about her." The underlying themes of "Apart Together" include the feelings of isolation and "otherness" and the search for a valuable human dignity. Social media. Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. "Every one of these (refugees) have strong stories, and in the bureaucratic system, they are just a number or a document," Dumig said. "But they are a person, they are people with emotions and lives." Sahra is currently under the status of "suspension of deportation," meaning German immigration officials may grant her discretionary relief from deportation. Dumig describes Sahra as someone living through an unresolved situation. Regardless of the challenges Sahra faces as a refugee in Germany, she is a survivor and the embodiment of resilience, determined to establish a new life for herself. She has learned to speak German fluently, and she has started working in the nation as well. Like an unsolved photographic puzzle, each photo within "Apart Together" provides a piece of insight into Sahra's experiences. There is no certain and clear way in which to arrange the pieces, because they are a representation of the fragmented nature of Sahra's life. Many of Dumig's photos are not of Sahra herself, but instead show her surroundings. This makes "Apart Together" rich in symbolism and challenges viewers to develop their own perceptions. The photos are powerful because of this symbolic nature, as there are infinite interpretations attached to each one. "I think everyone interprets by themselves, by however way they perceive it through their own experience. That's up to the viewer," Dumig said. "It depends on who looks at the pictures.... Everyone will see something different." "Apart Together" allowed Dumig to share various special moments with Sahra, and they were both able to learn from each other. "It was just something we both got something out of," Dumig said. Ines Dumig is a photographer based in Germany.

Article: Every one of Africa's 54 member countries will vote for Sepp Blatter in next month's FIFA presidential election, the continent's soccer boss said on Tuesday, referring to the 79-year-old Swiss as 'dear Sepp.' In front of Blatter's three challengers, Issa Hayatou, president of the Confederation of African Football, promised unanimous support in his speech to open CAF's annual congress in Cairo. 'Africa is comfortable having you. Africa stays with you,' Hayatou said, according to a transcript of his comments provided by CAF. Sepp Blatter (left) has received the full backing of African football's president Issa Hayatou (right) Blatter was also present, and made a speech to the African football leaders in his role as FIFA president. Although the individual countries don't have to follow Hayatou's directive, Africa is expected to be a strong base of support for Blatter. With 54 of the 209 FIFA member countries eligible to vote in the presidential election in Zurich on May 29, Africa is the largest of the six continental confederations. The praise Blatter received in Egypt contrasted to his uncomfortable reception at the UEFA congress last month, when his presidency was criticized by the three candidates standing against him, and some European officials. Luis Figo (left) and Michael van Pragg (right) are opposing Blatter and have chosen to run for presidency. Hayatou, a FIFA vice president and now an ally of Blatter after failing to unseat him in 2002, made an apparent reference to that UEFA congress on Tuesday. 'Dear Sepp,' he said. 'I want to reiterate that here in Africa you are never on some strange or hostile territory. You shall always be at home here, on this continent.' Blatter is seeking a fifth term in office to extend a reign that began in 1998. FIFA vice president Prince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan, Dutch FA head Michael van Praag, and former Portugal international Luis Figo are standing against him. Prince Ali bin al-Hussein is the third challenger and the FIFA vice-president was in attendance in Zimbabwe. Those three challengers won't be addressing CAF delegates like they did at UEFA's congress. CAF said the three were attending merely as 'observers.' In his speech, Blatter reflected on Africa's achievements during his time as FIFA president, including the continent's first World Cup in South Africa in 2010. He said Cameroon's Hayatou, who has led CAF for 27 years despite allegations of corruption and an official reprimand by the IOC, was a 'pillar' of African football, according to CAF.

Article: (CNN)At first police in Marana, Arizona, thought the shoplifted gun Mario Valencia held as he walked through a busy office park was locked and unable to fire. The cable through the lever and trigger couldn't be taken off, an officer was told by an employee of the Walmart where Valencia took the gun and some rounds of ammunition. But just 10 seconds after the worker told police that... a shot. Valencia had fired into the air, and less than a minute later a police car slammed into him in a move that ended a crime spree and sparked nationwide discussion on the officer's unusual tactic. The 36-year-old Valencia was hospitalized and within a few days transferred to jail where he faces 15 charges, including shoplifting the.30-30 rifle. That February morning, police have said, Valencia committed several crimes in nearby Tucson before stealing a car and driving to the Walmart in Marana. There he went to the sporting goods department, asked to see a rifle, then told an employee he wanted the ammunition. Officer who drove into suspect justified, chief says. The woman told police she gave Valencia the rounds because he told her he would break the case with the bullets inside. He also told her not to do anything stupid. In spite of that she also said she didn't feel threatened, leading police to charge him with shoplifting and not armed robbery. Walmart told CNN's Miguel Marquez that  the store clerk acted appropriately, even using a code to alert security to call police. Valencia took the gun and ammo and fled into a nearby business park where he encountered an officer in a slow-moving patrol car. At one point he pointed the weapon at an officer and at another he pointed it at his head. The officer told him several times to put down the gun, police have said. The officers that were tailing him assumed that he likely couldn't shoot anyone because of the store's lock. Marana police on Thursday said the cable gun lock was still on the rifle when it was recovered. But the wire that goes through the trigger and the lever to reload the gun were loose enough to allow it to still be used, police said. It also should have been wrapped through the lever twice, not once, police said. A Walmart spokesman told CNN that the rifle had been properly locked and might have been affected by the hard blow caused by the police car. Valencia, who is in Pima County Jail, will appear in court again on May 18.

Article: Alan Pardew says Sunderland should be more concerned about his in-form Crystal Palace side than his past as Newcastle manager this Saturday. Palace beat Manchester City on Monday night and have ambitions of finishing in the Barclays Premier League's top 10 this season. Pardew was the first Newcastle boss to suffer four successive defeats to Sunderland, who last weekend won a fifth Tyne-Wear derby in a row, but is now only thinking about Palace. 'We're going there in great form. The stadium will be wary of us, the 11 players on the pitch,' Pardew said. Glenn Murray (second from right) celebrates with his  team-mates after scoring against Manchester City. Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew thinks Sunderland fans should concentrate on his in-form side. 'Irrespective of my reception, it's about the 11 players on the pitch and Sunderland fans know that we're in really good form. 'The group is on a high. We have a different type of game this Saturday and we need to make the adjustment quickly.' Pardew arrived at Selhurst Park in January with top-flight survival the target. Performances and results have surpassed expectations, but Pardew insists the Eagles must stick to the characteristics which have seen them soar to 11th place in the table. 'It is now about trying to keep our professionalism and keep on the process of what's been winning us games,' Pardew added. 'We haven't set an outcome target, in terms of points we're going to get, but we have talked about the standards that we've set and that we need to maintain those. 'If we maintain them, then our position might surprise a few. Jason Puncheon celebrates after scoring Palace's winning goal in their 2-1 victory against champions City. Jermain Defoe scores a stunning winner for Sunderland in the Tyne-Wear derby against Newcastle. 'We're three points away from the top 10 so of course it is (a realistic target).' Pardew believes Palace players will be viewed in a more favourable light when it comes to international honours. He said: 'All our players are going to be looked at in a kinder manner, or through a different lens to how they've been looked at - and so they should be. 'Our form is as good as the top three or four clubs in the country and therefore they should receive the plaudits for what they're doing. That would be only what they deserve.' Mile Jedinak could come straight in after his four-game suspension as midfielder Joe Ledley is a doubt with a hip injury. Pardew added: 'Joe Ledley's got a slight strain and we'll have to monitor that. 'He's been exceptional since I've been here, so we'll give him every opportunity to play.' Pardew, after four years as Newcastle boss, knows Sunderland well and was not surprised the Black Cats turned to former Rangers and Holland boss Dick Advocaat. 'I think it was a great move for them to have someone of his experience at this time and he's proving that,' Pardew added. 'It's fair to say they've gone a little bit more direct, a little bit more positive. 'They have some good players and it's always a difficult place to go. 'I don't think we're under an illusions. It's a team coming off the back of a great victory (beating Newcastle 1-0) and they will be buoyed for our game.

Crystal Palace face Sunderland at the Stadium of Light on Saturday. Ex-Newcastle boss Alan Pardew is prepared for a frosty reception. But he believes Black Cats fans should be more concerned about his side. Sunderland are 15th in the table and three points clear of the drop zone.

Article: (CNN)Two Delaware boys are in a coma and their father still is unable to talk or move two weeks after they became sick -- perhaps from pesticide exposure, federal officials say -- during a trip to the U.S. Virgin Islands, their lawyer said Saturday. Steve Esmond, his teenage sons and the teens' mother fell ill more than two weeks ago in St. John, where they were renting a villa at the Sirenusa resort. The family was airlifted to hospitals in the United States. The boys, 16 and 14, were in critical condition at a Philadelphia hospital on Saturday, the family's lawyer, James Maron of Delaware, said. "The boys are in rough shape," Maron said. "The family are all fighters," he added. "They're fighting for everything right now. I understand it's a long recovery." Esmond, also being treated at a hospital, is conscious but cannot move, Maron said. The teens' mother, Theresa Devine, was treated at a hospital but released, and is now in occupational therapy, Maron said. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Friday that the presence of a pesticide at the rented villa in St. John may have caused the illnesses, which were reported to the EPA on March 20. Paramedics were called to the villa, which the family began had been renting since March 14. Esmond was found unconscious; the boys and their mother were having seizures, Maron said. The lawyer did not say who called the paramedics. Elias Rodriguez, an EPA spokesman, said the agency's preliminary test results "do show that there was a presence of methyl bromide in the unit where the family was staying." Exposure to methyl bromide can result in serious health effects, including central nervous system and respiratory system damage, according to the EPA. The use of the pesticide is restricted in the United States because of its acute toxicity. It's not allowed to be used indoors. Only certified professionals are permitted to use it in certain agricultural settings. "It's an ongoing investigation; we're still on the island doing our assessment," Rodriguez said. "We have been doing different types of air sampling and wipe sampling." Final test results were expected next week. The EPA said it is working with local government agencies to investigate whether the family was made ill after a fumigation at the resort on March 18 and whether any environmental regulations or laws were violated. Maron, the family's attorney, declined to comment on the investigation. Depending on the season, the luxury villa where the family stayed rents between $550 and $1,200 per night. Sea Glass Vacations, which acts as a rental agent for several units at Sirenusa, said the unit directly below the one where the family stayed was recently treated for pests, but their unit was not treated. The company said it licensed an outside company, Terminix, for the pest control services. "Sea Glass Vacations does not treat the units it manages for pests but instead relies on licensed professionals for pest control services," the company said in a statement. The U.S. Department of Justice has initiated a criminal investigation into the matter, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing made Monday by ServiceMaster Global Holdings, the parent company of Terminix. In an email to CNN, a spokesman for Terminix wrote that the company is "committed to performing all work... in a manner that is safe for our customers, employees, the public and the environment" and is "looking into this matter internally, and cooperating with authorities." "We're thinking about the family, and we join the community in wishing them a speedy recovery," Terminix wrote. The SEC filing described the injuries to the family members as "serious."

Article: Philippe Coutinho fired Liverpool into the FA Cup semi-finals and made it a night to remember for Jordan Henderson. Liverpool’s captain provided the 70th-minute assist for Coutinho to break Blackburn Rovers’ resistance and secure a 1-0 win that sets up a Wembley date against Aston Villa a week on Sunday. It has been a dramatic 24 hours for Henderson, as his partner Beccy gave birth to their second daughter, Alba. The 25-year-old had not slept the night before the game. Philippe Coutinho hit the only goal of the game as Liverpool advanced to the FA Cup semi-finals. Kolo Toure (left) embraces new father Jordan Henderson on a day to remember for the Liverpool captain. The Brazilian playmaker put in a real all-action display for his team. As well as scoring the winner, he had the most shots, most touches, the highest duel success, highest dribble completion, and the most tackles. Henderson said: ‘Philippe has a great football brain. It’s the easy bit giving it to him. Another bit of brilliance wins the game and gives everyone a lift.’ Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers revealed Henderson told him there was no chance he was missing the fixture once the baby had arrived. Rodgers explained: 'His wife had a second child during the night so he had to go away, hadn't slept so much, travelled all the way back again and put in the performance he did tonight. It was a real captain's performance. 'He said to me, "Boss, as soon as the baby's out, I'll be coming back".' Brendan Rodgers (right) looks on as his side navigated their way through a tricky tie at Ewood Park. Liverpool celebrate a much-needed victory which sets up a Wembley date with Aston Villa on Sunday week. Coutinho has popped up with some important goals this season — five of his six strikes have earned Liverpool results (four wins and a draw). Rodgers thought the much-publicised review meeting he held with Liverpool's players on Sunday paved the way for them to get back to winning ways in the FA Cup. The Reds boss had denied a report that an internal meeting following the 4-1 defeat to Arsenal had descended into crisis talks and his players responded on the pitch by booking their spot in the FA Cup semi-finals at Wembley with a hard-fought 1-0 replay victory over Blackburn. 'There was a lot made of that,' he said. 'I'm a coach who speaks openly to players. Part of the coaching philosophy for me is about reviewing and reflecting performance. 'It's something that we've done all year when we were winning games. That provides us the lever to move forward - how can we be better, how can we improve? 'Because we lost a couple of games, there's a lot been made of that meeting but that review was very, very important in how we want to work. If you don't review and analyse your performance how can you get better?'

Article: (CNN)ISIS claimed responsibility for a suicide car bomb attack Friday near the U.S. Consulate in the Kurdish Iraqi city of Irbil, according to several Twitter accounts linked to the terror group. The U.S. Consulate was the target of the attack, ISIS said. At least four people were killed and 18 injured, police said. All U.S. Consulate personnel were safe and accounted for following the explosion, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said. Irbil is the capital of Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government. Police said the incident began with an explosion of a small improvised bomb in the area. After that blast, a car moved in the direction of the consulate. Security personnel fired at the car, which exploded but did not reach the consulate, a police official said. It appeared that people inside the car detonated explosives that the vehicle was carrying, according to the police official. A separate official, B.G. Hazhar Ismail, said three civilians were killed and five others were injured. Ismail is a spokesman for the Peshmerga, the  force that defends Iraq's Kurdish region. The blast sent a huge fireball into the sky on a street parallel to the consulate. Dark smoke filled the air, and gunfire was heard intermittently for the next hour. One witness said he saw attackers in a gunbattle with consulate security and police. Helicopters circled the neighborhood where the blast occurred, and a loudspeaker at the consulate building warned people to stay indoors and away from windows. In addition to the U.S. Consulate, the blast occurred immediately across the street from a strip of bars, cafes and shops popular with expats and consulate employees. The State Department thanked the response by the Kurdish government and will investigate the bombing together with them. "The United States will continue to stand with the people of the Iraqi Kurdistan Region and all Iraqis as we work together in confronting these terrorist acts and towards our shared goal of degrading and defeating (ISIS)," the department said in a statement. CNN's Kareem Khadder and Jason Hanna and journalist Mat Wolf contributed to this report.

Article: A former High Court judge who led the inquiry into the Bradford stadium fire which killed 56 football fans has dismissed claims the blaze was not an accident saying they are 'nonsense'. A new book by author Martin Fletcher has revealed a series of other blazes at businesses owned by or associated with Stafford Heginbotham, the club's chairman at the time of the tragedy in 1985. The official inquiry into the blaze, led by Mr Justice Oliver Popplewell, concluded that the fire was an accident, probably caused by a spectator dropping a cigarette into rubbish that had accumulated under an old timber stand at the Valley Parade ground. Former Bradford City chairman Stafford Heginbotham, left, with Mr Justice Popplewell in the aftermath of the Bradford City fire. Today, the former judge has dismissed claims the blaze was not an accident. The stand at the Valley Parade ground burns after a fire in 1985. 56 football fans were killed in the tragedy. Today Sir Oliver was asked about the new allegations in an interview on BBC Radio Leeds, where he rubbished Mr Fletcher's claims. The retired judge said the main flaw in the argument that the fire was arson was that the stand involved had no insurance value as it was due for demolition. He also added that the fire was examined by experienced and thorough investigators, who found nothing suspicious and that no question of arson was ever raised in civil legal proceedings. He explained: 'I'm sorry to spoil what is obviously a very good story but I'm afraid it's nonsense for a number of reasons.' Sir Oliver also rejected claims his inquiry was held too quickly, three weeks after the fire. He added: 'I can quite understand after having previous fires some suspicion being raised but, as far as I’m concerned, we conducted our inquiry perfectly properly and I have no reason believe it was other than an accident.' The new claims about the fire at Valley Parade are contained in the book Fifty-Six by Mr Fletcher, who was 12 at the time and escaped the blaze. Author Martin Fletcher has revealed a series of other blazes at businesses owned by or associated with Stafford Heginbotham, the club's chairman at the time of the tragedy in 1985. He is pictured here with his mother Susan as a 12-year-old. The fire broke out near to half-time during Bradford's game against Lincoln City on May 11, 1985 and within four minutes the stand was completely ablaze. Mr Fletcher lost three generations of his family in the tragedy, including his 11-year-old brother Andrew, the fire's youngest victim, as well as his father John, 34, uncle Peter, 32, and grandfather Eddie, 63. The book, published today and being serialised in The Guardian, does not make any direct allegations but Mr Fletcher says Mr Heginbotham’s history with fires, which he claims resulted in payouts totalling around £27 million in today’s terms, warranted further investigation. He asks: 'Could any man really be as unlucky as Heginbotham had been?' The disaster also occurred at a time, according to Mr Fletcher’s evidence, when the businessman was in desperate financial trouble - and two days after he discovered it would cost £2million to bring the ground up to safety standards required by Bradford’s promotion from the old Third Division. The fire at the ground broke out close to half-time during Bradford's home game against Lincoln City on May, 11, 1985. An official inquiry found that the fire was started by accidentally when a fan discarded a cigarette on to rubbish below the timber stand. Mr Fletcher is the only survivor to publicly challenge the official inquiry, which took place three weeks after the fire. Mr Fletcher is the only survivor to publicly challenge the official inquiry, describing it as inadequate and saying it took place far too close to the event. Meanwhile Mr Heginbotham’s son James, 47, has defended his father, who died in 1995. He told told the Daily Mirror: 'When you actually do your homework and see what he did for Bradford City Football Club it is a sickening accusation. It is just absolutely ridiculous. 'He never recovered from the fire. The stress of it is what killed him eventually. 'He’s no longer here to defend himself. It’s a real shame it has come to this.' Meanwhile, yesterday former sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe said the new allegations do not justify a new inquiry into the disaster. The remains of the stand after the fire. West Yorkshire Police said the force would consider any new evidence about the blaze, which also injured 265 people. Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher visited Valley Parade to survey the damage to the stand and pay her respects with her husband Dennis. Mr Sutcliffe, MP for Bradford South and deputy leader of Bradford City Council at the time of the tragedy, said he knew Mr Heginbotham 'flew by the seat of his pants' in terms of the finances of the club, but remains convinced by the conclusion of the inquiry. West Yorkshire Police said the force would consider any new evidence about the fire. Detective Superintendent Mark Ridley, of the Homicide and Major Enquiry Team, said: 'The jury at the inquest in 1985 delivered a verdict of misadventure. 'However should any evidence come to light which was not available to Her Majesty’s Coroner at the original inquest, then we will consider its significance and take appropriate action.' A minute’s silence is due to be held at every Premier League and Football League match on Saturday, April 25 to mark the forthcoming 30th anniversary of the fire. It was the worst stadium fire in the history of British football and prompted important safety changes in grounds across the land. The final of game of the season should have been a day of celebration for Bradford City. Before kick-off the team were presented with the trophy for winning the Third Division title as 11,076 fans watched on. But instead, May 11, 1985 ended in tragedy as flames engulfed the Main Stand at Valley Parade. The Valley Parade blaze is considered the worst stadium fire in the history of British football and prompted important safety changes in grounds across the land. The fire was spotted at 3.40pm towards the end of the first half and within minutes the stand packed with 4,000 spectators was fully ablaze. The disaster left 56 supporters dead and a further 265 injured. In the years that followed,  new legislation was introduced governing safety at the nation's sports grounds. The tragedy brought about an unprecedented  community spirit in the city, with, among many other initiatives, a fundraising drive for the Burns Unit at Bradford Royal Infirmary. In 2010, on the 25th anniversary, there were an estimated two thousand at the service in the city's Centenary Square but this year there has been such a surge of interest that the club considered moving it to Valley Parade.

Mr Justice Popplewell says he has no reason to believe fire wasn't accident. The former judge led the inquiry into the blaze at the Bradford City ground. Comes after survivor of blaze says tragedy might not have been accident. Author Martin Fletcher says his findings warrant further investigation.

Article: (CNN)More than 300 suspects have been arrested in South Africa in connection with deadly attacks on foreigners that have forced thousands to flee, the government said Sunday. "We once again unequivocally condemn the maiming and killing of our brothers and sisters from other parts of the continent,"  the government said. "No amount of frustration or anger can justify these attacks and looting of shops." Thousands sought refuge in temporary shelters after mobs with machetes attacked immigrants in Durban. The attacks in Durban killed two immigrants and three South Africans, including a 14-year-old boy, authorities said. Heavily armed police have scrambled to stop clashes after local residents accused immigrants from other African nations of taking their jobs. The government praised law enforcement agencies for stopping further bloodshed in Durban. "We believe that their commitment to duty has prevented injuries and even deaths that could have happened if they security forces had not acted," it said. The xenophobic sentiment is certainly not representative of all South Africans. "There has been an outpouring of support from ordinary South Africans who are disgusted with the attacks not only because they are foreign, or African, but because they are fellow human beings," said Gift of the Givers charity, which is helping those seeking refuge. The charity said last week that about 8,500 people had fled to refugee centers or police stations because of the violence. South Africa's government implored citizens to remember the country's history of overcoming challenges with the support of African neighbors. "During the Apartheid many South Africans fled persecution and death at the hands of the Apartheid government," it said in its statement. "Africa opened its doors and became a home away from home for many South Africans." President Jacob Zuma has canceled a trip to Indonesia and visited displaced foreign nationals in Chatsworth to express his support, the government said. The Gift of the Givers charity assured immigrants that it has a facility in Johannesburg to help those who might need shelter there. "We have tents and all essential supplies on standby but pray that sanity prevails and this does not become necessary," it said. In the past, Johannesburg has been the epicenter of anti-immigrant tensions. In 2008, scores were killed in attacks in the poorest areas of Johannesburg. Most of the victims were Zimbabweans who had fled repression and dire economic circumstances. In that attack, police arrested more than 200 people for various crimes including rape, murder, robbery and theft. CNN's Larry Register contributed to this report.

Article: Nico Rosberg has accused his own Mercedes team of putting him ‘under pressure’ during qualifying for the Chinese Grand Prix. Rosberg will start Sunday's race behind team-mate Lewis Hamilton after he missed out on pole by just 0.042secs in Shanghai. Informed he had been out-qualified by his championship rival for the third straight race, an exasperated Rosberg said: ‘Oh, come on, guys’, over the team radio. Nico Rosberg will start behind pole-sitter Lewis Hamilton with Sebastian Vettel third on the grid in China. Rosberg cut a frustrated figure in the paddock after he missed out on pole to Hamilton by just 0.042secs. The German was the final driver out of the pit-lane during qualifying meaning he had to turn in a quicker out-lap than he would have liked to start his final shot at usurping Hamilton before the chequered flag fell. ‘We need to look at that,’ said Rosberg. ‘It was not ideal to put me under pressure like that. I don’t think it cost me anything, but still even the mindset that I had to speed up. It is very annoying.’ Rosberg improved his time, but still fell agonisingly short of Hamilton’s best lap. The momentum is with the Briton this year and Rosberg cut a grumpy figure in the paddock after qualifying. Sparks fly off the back of Rosberg's Mercedes during qualifying for tomorrow's race in Shanghai. The German has now been out-qualified by Hamilton at each of the three races this season. Nevertheless, he remains confident he can prevent Hamilton from claiming his fourth victory in Shanghai on Sunday. ‘There are a few opportunities [to pass Hamilton],’ Rosberg, who was speaking to Sky Sports, said. ‘There is the start, there is strategy and then there is tyre degradation. Tyre degradation is going to be big issue because we are going to take the tyres to the limit so there is going to be lots of opportunities.’ Hamilton will start from the front of the pack as he bids to win his fourth grand prix in China.

Article: Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has confessed his academy players are not ready to step into his first-team squad, hinting that City may look to cherry-pick the best youngsters from their top-flight rivals. In the week that Liverpool’s Raheem Sterling spoke about his unwillingness to agree a new contract at Anfield, Pellegrini’s comments suggest that City may look to invest heavily in other teams’ homegrown talent this summer. Premier League regulations require clubs to carry at least eight homegrown players, which can include youngsters who have spent three of their formative years at an English club. FA chairman Greg Dyke is pushing for the figure to be raised to 12. Manuel Pellegrini says the academy players at Manchester City are not ready for the first team. Pellegrini's assertions may mean City buy English players like Raheem Sterling to reach homegrown quotas. Everton's England international midfield player Ross Barkley has also been linked with City. But the lack of suitable candidates emerging from Patrick Vieira’s academy means City’s only option will be to buy in the bulk of their quota, with the defending league champions also linked with Arsenal’s Jack Wilshere and Ross Barkley of Everton. City’s current group of home-grown players will be reduced in the summer when Frank Lampard departs and it could be further depleted if James Milner, who wants guarantees of more regular first-team football, opts to leave. Coincidentally, Liverpool is Milner’s most likely destination should he leave but the prospect of Sterling moving in the opposite direction has been increased to the point that bookmakers rate City his most likely destination next season. City’s youth system has come under fire in recent seasons for its lack of productivity. Belgian defender Dedryck Boyata, who has started nine league games in nearly six years at City, is the only former academy player anywhere near first-team contention. Pellegrini said: ‘We must be patient with the academy. Young players are important. Maybe it’s not so easy for young players, especially at big clubs, to play in the first team, with the professional squad. But I’m sure in the future we will have very important players coming from the academy. James Milner could leave City in the summer with Liverpool a potential destination. Arsenal midfield player Jack Wilshere has also been linked with a transfer to City. Defender Dedryck Boyata (right) is City's only academy player near first-team contention. ‘But it’s important to have years of working the same way. But you never know. Maybe some talented young players can do it soon.’ Sterling would fit the bill, if his impasse at Liverpool proves unsolvable, although Pellegrini refused to comment directly about the Liverpool and England forward. Pellegrini said: ‘I think it’s important for big clubs to bring in the best players, that’s the most important thing. If they’re all good players, of course I agree with the quota. All the big leagues — especially the Premier League — need the best players to play.’ City’s homegrown quota is made up of Boyata, Lampard, Milner, Joe Hart, reserve keeper Richard Wright and Gael Clichy, who qualifies from his years spent with Arsenal. They are joined by four academy players — Thierry Ambrose, George Glendon, Jose Angel Tasende and Jose Angel Pozo, although Spaniard Pozo is the only one to have been near the first team this season. A number of young City professionals, including John Guidetti at Celtic, PSV’s Karim Rekik and Marcos Lopes with Lille, are on loan and may be brought back to plug some of the holes next season, although a big investment in English talent via the transfer market seems the only option. Frank Lampard helps make up City's homegrown quota but is leaving for New York at the end of the season. Patrick Vieira is overseeing the City academy's production of youth and homegrown players. Striker John Guidetti is on loan at Celtic but could return to meet quota regulations next season. Meanwhile, Pellegrini is not in action until Monday, when he takes his team to Crystal Palace, and with Chelsea in an apparently commanding lead at the top, the City manager admits his side face eight cup finals. He said: ‘I hope we can do it. We have to play eight finals from now until the end. We will see the way we play. I hope the way we finish against West Brom is the way we must continue. ‘It is not easy to make a clear analysis because they play with one player less. I hope in these eight games we continue playing that way.’

Manuel Pellegrini believes his youth players are not ready for the first-team. His homegrown quote will be depleted when Frank Lamapard leaves. Pellegrini may lose James Milner, forcing him to invest in home talent.

Article: (CNN)In response to reports of big banks threatening to withhold campaign funds from Senate Democrats, Sen. Elizabeth Warren last week offered a defiant response: "Bring it on." Warren said she isn't going to slack off on her calls for breaking up banks and other measures to rein in Wall Street. As Hillary Clinton prepares to officially launch her presidential campaign this month, she will need to make a choice about how much to highlight issues relating to economic inequality. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, who is also running for the Democratic nomination, is trying to steal Clinton's thunder by talking about the problems of disproportionate wealth. In other words, there are many signs that Democrats are planning to take on the big issue of economic inequality. But in other recent news, the likelihood that New York's Chuck Schumer will replace Harry Reid as leader of the Senate Democrats means the dreams of a more economically leftward party are crashing into political reality. While Schumer has been a very effective Democrat and skilled legislative leader, he is also a Wall Street Democrat who has spent much of his time courting and protecting powerful financial interests who run one of the dominant industries in his state. He is not alone. Even at his most progressive moments, President Barack Obama relied on Wall Street donations for both of his campaigns. Despite all the talk from conservatives about left-wing "socialism" in the White House, the financial community has been willing to open its coffers to Democrats without much concern, even in the 2012 election. Democratic populism can't really work within the current campaign finance system.  The enormous pressures for parties to raise funds in campaigns has for many decades created pressure on Democrats, despite their political base, to court big donors. During the 1980s, California Democrat Tony Coelho, serving as the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and then as majority whip, made a strong appeal to savings and loans executives before the crash of the industry to catch up to Republicans who had been outflanking them in raising money. The Democrats were, and have continued to, losing their traditional base of campaign support --organized labor -- which had been a central source of campaign muscle since the 1930s, providing money and campaign assistance during campaigns. Without organized labor to serve as their foundation and with the pressure for raising private funds increasing, many Democrats concluded they needed business by their side. Democrats running for president have made the same kind of choices. In 2008, Obama disappointed many supporters upon becoming the first president to abandon the post-Watergate public finance system for campaigns altogether, preferring to raise money himself for the general campaign. While small donors were enormously important to his victories, so too were business and Wall Street executives. At the height of the financial crash, when public sentiment had clearly turned against Wall Street, the administration agreed to a financial regulation bill (Dodd-Frank) that was structured in such a way as to give powerful interests more than enough opportunity to limit the bite over the coming years. Wall Street, with an army of counsel, succeeded in eroding the impact of the legislation. Not only does the acceptance of our campaign finance system limit the policy choices Democrats can make, but it also greatly damages the party's brand name. As The Washington Post reported, the scandal that might bring down New Jersey Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez is the first involving large scale super PAC donations. At the heart of the story is almost $600,000 that physician Salomon Melgen gave to Senate Majority PAC, possibly in exchange for favors. This is not simply some sort of accommodation of Democrats to the corporate system. They don't have much of a choice. Without these funds, they won't be able to compete. In this election cycle, independent campaign donors are causing a huge stir. In conservative circles, the Koch brothers and their allies are throwing around enormous amounts of money to candidates who will support their deregulatory agenda. Individual donors such as Las Vegas gambling magnate Sheldon Adelson are causing ripples every time candidates speak, pressuring them to adjust their agenda. Democrats have found their own magnates for political support, such as Tom Steyer and George Soros. This is why campaign finance reform is so important, Without Congress changing the fundamental dynamics, there won't be much room for populism to thrive. Even if Democrats select someone like a Elizabeth Warren as their candidate or Hillary Clinton decides to move sharply to the left on economic policy, there won't be much room for reform when the time of governance actually starts. The Democratic Party needs Wall Street more than it needs to take a stand against Wall Street. Those are the facts on the ground. If Democrats really want to take on Wall Street and tackle economic inequality, they first have to bring about reform of the campaign finance system. If campaigns were publicly funded or there were more stringent limits on independent expenditures, Wall Street would have much more trouble achieving disproportionate influence. Reform could level the playing field. More often than not, campaign finance reform is an issue that gets sidetracked with little more than some pro forma words of support. A more populist economic agenda that revolved around progressive taxation and substantial public assistance to strengthen the middle class can only work in a different kind of political system. If things stay the same, Democrats can only continue to win elections by turning to their corporate and financial base of support.

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence. Democrats, despite their political base, court big donors, including Wall Street executives, due to the pressure of raising funds in campaigns and the loss of organized labor as a central source of campaign

Article: Cristiano Ronaldo scored the 300th goal of his Real Madrid career to become the third player in the club's history to reach the landmark alongside Alfredo Di Stefano and Raul. The Portugal forward netted against Rayo Vallecano in the 68th minute to move Madrid within four points of their great rivals Barcelona, letting out his frustration  following an unfair booking for a dive which could see the three-time Ballon d'Or winner suspended for Saturday's La Liga game with Eibar. Yet Ronaldo joined the 300 club in just 288 appearances by doing what all forwards should, sending a header downwards and beating goalkeeper Cristian Alvarez, before celebrating with Gareth Bale and his team-mates. Cristiano Ronaldo scored the 300th goal of his Real Madrid career to see off Rayo Vallecano and remain four points behind Barcelona. Ronaldo joined the 300 club in just 288 appearances with this header against Rayo Vallecano on Wednesday night. Ronaldo turns to his trademark celebration after scoring the 300th goal of his Real Madrid career. The Portugal forward netted in the 68th minute to move Madrid within four points of their great rivals. Ronaldo celebrates with Real Madrid team-mate Gareth Bale after opening the scoring for the Spanish club. Ronaldo is swamped by his Real Madrid team-mates after scoring the opening goal of the night. Rayo Vallecano: Cristian, Tito, Amaya, Zé Castro, Nacho, Fatau, Trashorras, Embarba, Kakuta, Bueno, Manucho. Subs: Cobeno, Miku, Insua, Ba, Aquino, Ruiz Jozabed, Lica. Goals: NONE. Booked: Tito, Nacho, Cobeno, Amaya. Real Madrid: Casillas; Carvajal, Varane, Ramos, Marcelo; Kroos, Modric, James; Cristiano, Benzema, Bale. Subs: Navas, Coentrao, Hernandez, Nacho, Jese, Isco, Illarramendi. Goals: Ronaldo (68), Rodriguez (73) Booked: Rodriguez, Ronaldo, Kroos, Bale, Carvajal. Not only that, the former Manchester United great has scored 99 goals under manager Carlo Ancelotti in just 89 games, following his five against Granada three days ago. His latest puts the 30-year-old  just seven goals behind Di Stefano's record of 307 in 396 outings, and 23 shy of Raul's 323 in 741 — with plenty of time to surpass both Bernabeu legends. Up until his opening goal 22 minutes from time, however, it long looked like Ancelotti would be left as deflated as the balloons that Ronaldo took a disliking to in the first half. Ronaldo had given four orange balloons that invaded the pitch at the Campo de Futbol de Vallecas a kicking as his team failed to dominate against a team with little left to play for in mid-table. Rayo in no way had their flip flops on, and fancied giving the winners of La Decima a run for their money. They did just that, proving far more difficult than the Granada side beaten 9-1 on Sunday. Yet Real's rotten luck was epitomised by Ronaldo's yellow card  in the 52nd minute, received for diving inside the 18-yard box with the game at 0-0. He had beaten the offside trap, before cutting inside to shoot, only for defender Antonio Amaya to chop him down. Quite clearly, too. Replays were not needed to show it was a wrong decision from referee Mario Melero Lopez to book Ronaldo for diving. From every angle, there was no question it should have been a penalty, and Ancelotti will appeal the caution in a bid to have his one-game ban rescinded. 'I told the referee that everyone saw it was a penalty,' Ancelotti said afterwards. 'I told him it was incredible that he didn't award a penalty and that he showed Cristiano the yellow card. We will appeal.' The booking lit something in the stomachs of the Madrid players, as Toni Kroos, Bale and Dani Carvajal were cautioned for dissent less than three minutes later before they broke the deadlock soon after. Ronaldo gave four orange balloons a kicking in the first half on what was shaping up to be a frustrating evening for CR7. Ronaldo was having a frustrating evening until he scored his 300th of the career for Real Madrid. 300 - goals. 288 - appearances. 206 - right footed. 52 - left footed. 41 - headers. 55 - penalties. 77 - assists. On 68 minutes,  Carvajal got his own back. The Spain right-back escaped his marker down the  wing before crossing for Ronaldo to head home his 300th goal for Los Blancos. An easy way to reach a milestone. Ronaldo, in celebration, gestured towards the linesman who robbed him of the penalty and, from then on, the win never looked in doubt. It was James Rodriguez who put daylight between the teams just five minutes later. The Colombia international's controlled shot found the bottom-left corner, and effectively killed the game off to ensure Madrid would not be left six points adrift of Barcelona. Ancelotti added: 'We tried to pressure them with more intensity high up the pitch but in the first half we were not convincing. In the second, we were more complete, we played well and we deserved to win.' They will have to repeat the trick  on Saturday against Eibar to remain within touching distance of Barcelona, but are set to be without the suspended Ronaldo. The man Real paid £80million for in 2009 continued his protests with the officials after the full-time whistle, but it seems he will have to wait patiently to chase down Di Stefano and Raul. Madrid's rotten luck was epitomised by Ronaldo's yellow card from referee Mario Melero Lopez for this so-called dive. Ronaldo couldn't believe it as he was not awarded a penalty and was booked afterwards for diving. Ronaldo complains during the match as it was not going his way until his goal in the second half. James Rodriguez doubled Real's lead on Wednesday to ensure the win for the Spanish giants.

Article: (CNN)Thursday will mark three weeks since Saudi Arabia began airstrikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen. But there is as yet little sign that the rebels are being driven back, that the fighting in Yemen is dying down or that lives there are being saved. To the contrary, increasingly more Yemenis appear to be fleeing the country, attempting the dangerous trip in rickety fishing boats across the Red Sea to the Horn of Africa -- a trip historically made by people fleeing Africa rather than the other way around. Hopes for stability, not only in Yemen but in the Middle East in general, are fading as fears grow that Saudia Arabia and Iran are fighting a proxy war in Yemen for regional domination. And the number of dead continues to mount. Yemen's health ministry said over the weekend that 385 civilians had been killed and 342 others had been wounded. The World Health Organization has put a higher figure on both tolls -- 648 killed and 2,191 wounded -- but includes militant casualties in the totals. The Houthis forced Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi from power in January, though Hadi still claims he is Yemen's legitimate leader and is working with the Saudis and other allies to return to Yemen. Those allied with Hadi have accused the Iranian government of supporting the Houthis in their uprising in Yemen. Like the Iranians, the Houthis are Shiites. And like the Saudis, Hadi and his government are Sunni. Since it began on March 26, Saudi Arabia has launched more than 1,200 airstrikes. Saudi officials claim to have killed more than 500 Houthi rebels. The U.N. Security Council voted Tuesday in favor of an arms embargo on Houthis -- the minority group that has taken over large swaths of Yemen, including its capital, Sanaa -- and supporters of former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh. The resolution "raises the cost" for the Houthis, according to Mark Lyall Grant, Britain's ambassador to the United Nations. In addition to the arms embargo, the resolution also demands that the Shiite group pull back and refrain from more violence and includes sanctions aimed at controlling the spread of terrorism, according to Grant. Russia abstained from Tuesday's vote, saying it didn't like the inclusion of sanctions. Why is Saudi Arabia bombing Yemen?

Article: Matej Vydra's superb volley helped keep Watford on the trail for automatic promotion as they recorded a 2-0 victory over a spirited Millwall side, who sank further into relegation trouble. Millwall were on top for much of the first half but a stunning hit from Vydra saw the Hornets take in a slender advantage at half-time. Aiden O'Brien was a constant menace for the hosts - who had an early penalty shout turned down - but Watford were far too clinical, as Adlene Guedioura slotted a vital second goal shortly after the break. Matej Vydra fires home his stunning volley from the edge of the box to put Watford into the lead. Vydra is congratulated by his Watford team-mates as his goal moved the club towards automatic promotion. Millwall keeper David Forde was called into action in the first minute, doing well to deny Troy Deeney after the striker had broken the offside trap. The Lions quickly gathered momentum and despite some promising approach play - with O'Brien at the heart of much of it - failed to create any meaningful opportunities. And the home side had a legitimate penalty shout after Ben Watson bundled over of Ed Upson, as the midfielder jinked in from the right, but that went unpunished. After Watford weathered the storm, Vydra produced his moment of inspiration by volleying in from just outside the box in the 26th minute. Forde was helpless as the Czech thumped the ball into the far corner from Ikechi Anya's cross. Millwall, playing with renewed hope of survival after a first win in 10 on Good Friday, then squandered a golden opportunity when Martyn Woolford failed to pick out O'Brien lurking unmarked two yards from goal. Adlene Guedioura celebrates in front of the travelling fans after making it 2-0 and sealing the three points. Troy Deeney, who went close early on, is tackled by Millwall's Shaun Williams during the Championship clash. The hosts also ended the half in the ascendency as Jimmy Abdou's scuffed shot was well saved by Heurelho Gomes. Millwall huffed and puffed as they had in the first-half, but created few chances of any note. They came closest to boosting their slim survival hopes when O'Brien robbed Matthew Connolly of possession, but Gomes saved well. In the 54th minute, Anya - as he did for Vydra's opener - created Watford's second. The Scottish winger combined with Troy Deeney to outfox Shaun Cummings and Sid Nelson before squaring for Guedioura, who tucked away a six-yard tap-in. Deeney dives in to stop Dan Harding getting past, as Millwall slipped closer to relegation. It was a goal that Watford's second-half performance deserved, as they overcame Millwall's superiority before the break to showcase the quality that puts them on the brink of the Premier League. They twice came close to adding to the lead, as first Vydra then Odion Ighalo ran free on goal. Forde managed to gather the ball at Vydra's feet and then saved agilely from substitute Ighalo. Avoiding defeat would have equalled their longest unbeaten run of the season at four games, but the Lions more than likely need to go without a loss in all five of their remaining fixtures to stand any chance of beating the drop.

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence.
Matej Vydra converts Ikechi Anya cross after 26 mintues. Adlene Guadeioura doubles Hornets advantage in second half. Millwall remain seven points from safety, and are second from bottom.

Article: Moscow (CNN)Joy Womack is taking part in her first ballet class of the day at the Kremlin Ballet Theatre, kicking her legs up to her head, jumping and spinning across the room. After class, she eats boiled sweets, one after another -- they are a cheap form of energy. The dancer, raised in California and Texas, left her parents and eight brothers and sisters behind when she arrived in Russia six years ago, aged 15, speaking no Russian. She studied at the Bolshoi Ballet Academy and was one of the first Americans accepted from the school into the company. But in 2013 she left under a cloud -- media reports suggested she had claimed she was asked by an unnamed Boshoi official to pay $10,000 to dance in even small roles. The Bolshoi still stands by comments made at the time by its general director, Vladimir Urin. He asked the dancer to make an official complaint and defend her position legally, saying the theatre was ready to assist the law enforcement agencies to investigate the case and that "if the facts are legally established, those responsible should be punished accordingly." The dancer did not pursue a case against the Bolshoi. When she left the Bolshoi in 2013, Womack joined the Kremlin Ballet Theatre where she still works, aged 20, as a principal ballerina; dancing close to the Russian president's office, next to the cathedrals inside the red walls of the Kremlin. The surroundings may be opulent but her pay packet is not: for her role as a principal dancer Womack says she is paid around $240 a month -- which works out at around $8 a day. The dancer says the amount of money she makes in dollars each month has fallen as the Russian ruble has weakened -- the currency has suffered, in part, from a low oil price and international sanctions imposed on Russia over its annexation of Crimea last year. Womack says a friend helps her with accommodation and she says she has to make the money stretch in order to buy food. "For anyone paid a salary in rubles, especially since the crisis, it is extremely difficult. You have to decide what is worth more for you - experience or financial stability. I'm at a point in my life where experience is worth more." Sitting in the wings of the stage, chatting in Russian to the other dancers and stretching before her rehearsal for Swan Lake, she says she has to make the $185 in her bank account last for the next few weeks. To earn extra money she dances bigger roles or takes part in events abroad. The Kremlin Ballet Theatre says Womack's salary corresponds to her job title as a principal dancer and that, "on average, the salary [principal] dancers are paid is significantly higher" than $240 a month but that Womack could have been paid that equivalent in dollars "depending on the exchange rate on the day and depending on how much she danced in productions the previous month." As an American, Womack says she is paid the same as her contemporaries and is treated just like the Russians. But she says that is not always the case offstage. "It's extremely difficult to watch the deteriorating relationships between the United States and Russia. The great thing about working for a Russian company is that we are focused on creating art but...outside the ballet world it is difficult for foreigners; the general tendency tends to be more nationalistic and they unfortunately judge foreigners by their cover." Although relations between the U.S. and Russia have taken a nosedive since Russia's annexation of Crimea last March, Womack says she is "very loyal" to the Kremlin Ballet Theatre. "I love the Russian system and I'm very patriotic in that sense," she says. And despite the political situation -- and the money -- she says, "Russia has a lot to offer, it is a beautiful place that creates stars and that itself is worth investing one's career in.

Article: A daredevil climber known as the ‘French Spiderman’ has scaled the world’s tallest twisted skyscraper – without a safety harness. French climber Alain Robert climbed Dubai's 1,007ft Cayan Tower with nothing more than sticky tape and chalk, which he kept in a pouch clipped to his waist, for assistance. Hundreds of spectators looked on as the 52-year-old free-climber scaled the 75-storey tower that has a twist of 90 degrees. Alain Robert climbed the tower with nothing more than sticky tape and chalk, which he kept in a pouch clipped to his waist. The 52-year-old has previously suffered falls during his attempts to climb buildings across the world. Robert, who has suffered numerous falls during previous climbs, took an hour and a half to scale the high-rise building in the United Arab Emirates. The climb was captured on video and shows the daredevil ascending at 8.25pm without a harness while struggling to find space for his feet on the narrow ledges. A spotlight follows his progress as spectators below look up and film the stunt on their camera phones and Robert makes his way over a hanging ledge. The French daredevil set off at 8.25pm and the climb took him an hour and a half to complete. Hundreds of spectators looked on as the 52-year-old free-climber scaled the 75-storey tower. At one point Robert stands from the building and waves a flag in homage to real estate developers, Cayan Group, who gave him permission to climb the tower. Previously Robert has been arrested, imprisoned and banned from locations across the world including London's Shard for illegal ascent. The climbing feat is not the first to be achieved by the French Spiderman in Dubai. Robert has previously been arrested, imprisoned and banned from locations across the world for illegal ascent. Sense of scale: A spotlight follows the daredevil's progression as he makes his way up the buidling. In 2011, Robert scaled the world’s tallest tower, the Burj Khalifa, which stands at 2,717ft, in just over six hours. The daredevil used a rope and a harness on this occasion however, in compliance with regulations set by the organiser.

Article: (CNN)A group of six young Minnesota men conspired to sneak into Syria and join ISIS "by any means necessary," federal prosecutors said Monday. The group of friends, ages 19 to 21, were arrested Sunday. "What's remarkable about this case was that nothing stopped these defendants from plotting their goal," said U.S. Attorney Andrew M. Luger of the District of Minnesota. "They were not confused young men. They were not easily influenced. These are focused men who are intent on joining a terrorist organization by any means possible." Recruiting for the ISIS terrorist network is a particular problem in Minnesota's community of Somali immigrants. "People often ask who is doing the recruiting and when will we catch the person responsible," Luger said. "But it is not that simple. In today's case, the answer is that this group of friends is recruiting each other. They're engaged in what we describe as peer-to-peer recruiting." Zacharia Yusuf Abdurahman, 19; Adnan Farah, 19; Hanad Mustafe Musse, 19; and Guled Ali Omar, 20, were arrested in Minneapolis. Abdirahman Yasin Daud, 21, and Mohamed Abdihamid Farah, 21, were arrested in San Diego after driving there in hopes of crossing into Mexico, Luger said. They plotted for 10 months, Luger said. "Even when their co-conspirators were caught and charged, they continued to seek new and creative ways to leave Minnesota to fight for a terror group." Another friend, who was part of the group, changed his mind and became a cooperating witness for the FBI, even tape recording some meetings, Luger said. The FBI investigation has previously netted Abdullahi Yusuf, who has pleaded guilty to conspiring to provide material support to ISIS, and Hamza Ahmed, who has been indicted on charges of conspiring and attempting to provide material support to ISIS and is now pending trial, according to the criminal complaint. The complaint describes a man, identified only as "Nur," who has spent time in Syria and allegedly helped the six accused men. Four of the men who were arrested appeared in federal court on Monday but did not enter a plea. The judge ordered they all be held without bail, and a detention hearing was scheduled for Wednesday. CNN's Tony Marco contributed to this report.

Article: Barcelona coach Luis Enrique has sought to play down Neymar's petulant reaction when the Brazil forward was substituted in Saturday's 2-2 La Liga draw at Sevilla. Neymar, who scored a superb free kick to make it 2-0 to Barca after Lionel Messi's opener, was clearly furious at being replaced by Xavi with around 20 minutes left and Spanish media speculated he might be dropped for Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final, first leg at Paris St Germain. Luis Enrique declined to reveal who would start the match at the Parc des Princes but did make it clear that he was the one in charge and urged all his players to respect that. Luis Enrique has played down Neymar's angry reaction to be substituted against Sevilla. Neymar (left) speaks with Brazilian team-mates Adriano (centre) and   Rafinha during a training session. Barcelona face Chelsea' conquerors Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday in the Champions League. 'I haven't seen the footage,' Luis Enrique told reporters after he was asked about television images showing Neymar complaining to his team mates on the bench. 'As a coach I understand that all the players want to be on the pitch,' he added. 'And the players must understand that I am the coach and I have to make decisions. Beyond that you can speculate and draw the conclusions you want.' Asked again about Neymar's behaviour later in the news conference, Luis Enrique drew laughter by taking the chance to wish his mother a happy birthday. Luis Suarez (centre) and Gerard Pique joke around during the session at the Parcs des Princes Stadium. Messi (centre) takes part in a drill and the forward will need to be in top form to beat the French champions. Barca and PSG have already met twice in the Champions League group stage this term, with the Ligue 1 side winning 3-2 in Paris and Barca's 3-1 success at the Nou Camp helping them finish as pool winners. Barca are in the last eight of Europe's elite club competition for a record eighth season in a row, while PSG are seeking a last-four place for the second time, having lost to AC Milan in 1994-95 after beating Barca in the quarter-finals. PSG's hopes of making the semi-finals have been hit by suspensions and injury, with Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Italy midfielder Marco Verratti banned and midfielder Thiago Motta out with a thigh injury. The three-time Ballon d'Or winner looks on as his Barcelona team-mates take part in a heading drill. Brazil centre back David Luiz has been sidelined with a hamstring problem, but has been included in the squad for Wednesday's match. 'Obviously they have some players missing, we cannot hide that, but if we remember the group game when Ibrahimovic wasn't playing they beat us,' Luis Enrique said. 'Then when Ibrahimovic was playing in Barcelona we were able to beat them. 'They are important players for them without doubt but they have a strong squad and for sure they will cause us problems.' The return leg is in Barcelona on April 21. Neymar (centre) controls the ball during a training session at the Parc des Princes stadium.

Article: (CNN)In case you haven't noticed, we're in the midst of a medical marijuana revolution. Given the amount of questions and mystery surrounding the science behind it, Dr. Sanjay Gupta wanted to provide some insight. He's been investigating medical marijuana for the last couple of years. His research has resulted in three CNN documentaries, culminating with "Weed 3: The Marijuana Revolution," airing at 9 p.m. ET/PT Sunday. Gupta opened up to questions on Twitter. Here's what you wanted to know:. How does this affect me? Readers were curious about the effects of medical marijuana in easing symptoms of various ailments, asking how it could help with everything from life-threatening illnesses and neurological conditions to chronic pain and post-traumatic stress disorder. Gupta pointed out the 10 diseases where medical marijuana research could have an impact and how it helped to stop one young girl's severe seizures, and he also referenced other studies. He said that the potential benefits of medical marijuana for people suffering from PTSD is actually the subject of a federally approved study. The belief: It could suppress dream recall and allow those sufferers to focus on the present. There is also research into how the drug might affect the spasms associated with people who have multiple sclerosis. Medical marijuana could also be an important option for those who rely on painkillers, as painkiller overdose is the greatest preventable death in the United States, Gupta said. Why don't other doctors talk about it? Many of the questions around medical marijuana can be tied back to the fact that it's just not discussed much. Teaching about medical marijuana remains taboo in medical school. But Gupta also presented the science directly, showing what your body on weed looks like. Readers also wanted to know why people are so against the legalization of marijuana. Decades of misinformation, Gupta said. What are the drawbacks? With medical marijuana so misunderstood, there naturally is a fear of potential side effects. There are legitimate, long-term concerns with the developing brain, Gupta said, and suggested that readers seek out the research of Dr. Staci Gruber, who has conducted numerous studies on marijuana use and brain function. Isn't it dangerous? When confronted with questions rooted in fear about the dangers of medical marijuana, Gupta confessed that he used to believe the same thing -- that marijuana is dangerous without proven benefits. After extensive research, he said he changed his mind on weed.

Article: Surkhet, Nepal (CNN)Ten years ago, with her high school diploma and a backpack, Maggie Doyne left her New Jersey hometown to travel the world before college. She lived in a Buddhist monastery, helped rebuild a sea wall in Fiji, then went to India and worked with Nepalese refugees. There, she met a young girl who wanted to find her family in Nepal. Doyne went with her. That's when Doyne's life took an unexpected turn. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for CNN Heroes 2015. A decade-long civil war had just ended in the country, and Doyne witnessed its effects firsthand. She met women and children who were suffering, struggling to survive. "It changed me," said Doyne, now 28. "There were children with mallets that would go into the riverbed, pick up a big stone and break it into little, little pieces (to sell). And they were doing that all day, every day." Doyne called her parents and asked them to wire her the $5,000 she had earned babysitting. In 2006, she purchased land in Surkhet, a district in western Nepal. She worked for two years with the local community to build the Kopila Valley Children's Home. Today, Kopila -- which means "flower bud" in Nepali -- is home to about 50 children, from infants to teenagers. Doyne started the BlinkNow Foundation to support and grow her efforts. In 2010, the group opened its Kopila Valley School, which today educates more than 350 students. Doyne lives in Nepal year-round, traveling to the U.S. a few times a year. See more CNN Heroes. The CNN Heroes team traveled to Surkhet and talked to Doyne about her work and the community she supports. Below is an edited version of their conversation. CNN: How does it work, raising nearly 50 kids? Maggie Doyne: It's communal living, for sure! We're a family of almost 50 kids ages 8 months to 16 years. Everybody just pitches in and helps each other. They all have their chores. They all have their duties. And everybody cooks the meals together and makes sure that they do their part to make the home run smoothly. The staff at the home, we call them the aunties and the uncles. We wake up in the morning and go off to school. And then come home and do homework and eat our meals together, and everybody goes to bed at night. CNN: How does a child come to live in your home? Doyne: Our first priority as an organization is to keep a child with their family if at all possible. In order to come into the home, you need to have lost both parents, or in some rare cases have suffered extreme neglect, abuse or have a parent who's incarcerated. We have to conduct a full investigation. So usually that involves going to the child's village, making calls, doing police checks, getting documentation and paperwork. We have to dig up birth certificates, death certificates, make sure that everything lines up the way that they say it does. CNN: Meanwhile, you have 350 children attending your school. What is their background? Doyne: Every single year we'll get from 1,000 to 1,500 applicants. And we choose the ones who are the most needful and really won't be in school without us. Most of them live in one room, a mud hut. A lot of them are just in survival mode. We try to relieve the burden from the family, so that the child has food, medical care, books, zero fees for education. CNN: What have you learned working with the local community in Nepal? Doyne: I learned very early on, from the beginning, that I couldn't come in and just be like, "Here, I have a vision. This is what we're going to do." That doesn't work. It has to be slow; it has to be organic. And it has to come from the community and be a "we" thing. It's really important to me that this is a Nepali project, working for Nepal, for the community. So the faces that you see are strong Nepali women and amazing Nepali role-model men. CNN: How does the project continue to grow? Doyne: We started with the home and then school. We run the school lunch program. Then we needed to keep our kids really healthy, so we started a small clinic and then a counseling center. From there we started getting more sustainable and growing our own food. And then from there we decided to start a women's center. We just bought a new piece of property to create a totally green and sustainable off-the-grid campus. This year we converted to solar energy. So we'll have a high school and then a day care, preschool, elementary, all the way up, and a vocational center where kids can become a thriving young adult with everything they need to succeed moving forward. It's become so much more than just a little girl with a backpack and a big dream. It's become a community. And I want to teach and have other people take this example and hope this sets a precedent for what our world can be and look like. Want to get involved?
