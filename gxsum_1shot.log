Article: A report by the organisation suggests men, women and children are being abused "to eliminate public protest".
Many are subjected to virginity tests, rape and gang rape after arrest.
Egypt's Interior Ministry said it would not comment until it had studied the report.
The study notes a surge in sexual violence after the Egyptian military takeover in July 2013.
The perpetrators are rarely held to account and the impunity points to a "cynical political strategy aimed at silencing all opposition".
Police, intelligence officers and members of the military are guilty of targeting male and female detainees, according to the report.
Among the victims are student demonstrators, human rights activists, gay people and children.
Student's ordeal
I saw an officer who was grabbing a young woman by the breasts and I said to him: "If you want to arrest her, then arrest her, but you have no right to touch her breasts."
He grabbed me exactly as he had her, before calling two other police officers to come and hold me. They beat me, insulted me.
In the van they insulted me and beat me so much that I could no longer stand up. Two soldiers started to sexually assault me.
The officer from the start got into the van and said to me: "Come here I'm going to show you if I'm a man." He sexually assaulted me, the soldiers laughed, and then he raped me completely. I was paralysed, I started to vomit blood.
My life is ruined. I'm afraid of my son, my husband and even my father.
The authors said they did not have evidence that commanders were giving the orders, but the scale of the violence - and the impunity - suggested there was a political strategy.
They claim that victims who file complaints are systematically obstructed by the justice system, and face threats and reprisals by police officers and prison guards.
Sexual violence has long been a problem within the general population in Egypt, with assaults dramatically increasing in the years since Hosni Mubarak was removed from power.
Last year, President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi ordered police to launch a crackdown amid growing public anger.
He said sexual assaults, were "an unacceptable form of conduct" and called for citizens to "reinstate moral values in society".

Egyptian security forces are using sexual violence against detainees on a massive scale, according to the International Federation for Human Rights.

Article: Prison Link Cymru had 1,099 referrals in 2015-16 and said some ex-offenders were living rough for up to a year before finding suitable accommodation.
Workers at the charity claim investment in housing would be cheaper than jailing homeless repeat offenders.
The Welsh Government said more people than ever were getting help to address housing problems.
Changes to the Housing Act in Wales, introduced in 2015, removed the right for prison leavers to be given priority for accommodation.
Prison Link Cymru, which helps people find accommodation after their release, said things were generally good for women because issues such as children or domestic violence were now considered.
However, the same could not be said for men, the charity said, because issues which often affect them, such as post traumatic stress disorder or drug dependency, were often viewed as less of a priority.
Andrew Stevens, who works in Welsh prisons trying to secure housing for prison leavers, said the need for accommodation was "chronic".
"There's a desperate need for it, finding suitable accommodation for those leaving prison there is just a lack of it everywhere," he said.
"It could take six months to a year, without a lot of help they could be on the streets for six months.
"When you think of the consequences of either being on the street, especially with the cold weather at the moment or you may have a roof over your head, sometimes there is only one choice."
Mr Stevens believes building more one-bedroom flats could help ease the problem.
"The average price is a hundred pounds a week to keep someone in a rented flat, prison is a lot more than that so I would imagine it would save the public purse quite a few pounds," he said.
Official figures show 830 one-bedroom properties were built in the year to March 2016, of an overall total of 6,900 new properties in Wales.
Marc, 50, who has been in and out of prison for the past 20 years for burglary offences, said he struggled to find accommodation each time he was released.
He said he would ask himself: "Where am I going to stay? Where am I going to live? Have I got somewhere where I can see my daughter."
"You're put out among the same sort of people doing the same sort of thing, and it's difficult, it's difficult to get away from it. It's like every man for himself, there's nothing."
Marc has now found stable accommodation with homeless charity Emmaus and said it had been life changing.
"You feel safe, you got hot food, you've got company of people in similar situations to yourself but all dealing with different issues. It's a constructive, helpful atmosphere," he said.
Tom Clarke, chief executive of Emmaus South Wales, agreed there was not enough support available.
"We do still see [people] homeless on the streets, so clearly they haven't got accommodation and haven't got provision," he said.
"I think the key is connecting people with the services they need. I don't delude myself that Emmaus can offer a one size fits all for everyone, we can't.
"But there must be other opportunities and given suitable encouragement I believe that can and should happen."
A Welsh Government spokesman said the national pathway for homeless services to children, young people and adults in the secure estate had prevented many people from losing their home whilst serving their prison sentence.
It added there were already significant demands for one-bedroom flats across the public and private sector and it was providing 20,000 new affordable homes in the next five years.

Article: Philippe Bianchi told France Info radio his son, who remains in a coma, had shown "no significant progress" since crashing into a recovery vehicle last October at Suzuka.
"In general, progress needs to be made in the first six months," Bianchi said.
"It has been nine months now and Jules has still not woken up."
Frenchman Jules Bianchi, 25, continues to receive treatment for his severe injuries in hospital in his home city of Nice.
Philippe Bianchi added: "As time goes by, I am less optimistic than I might have been two or three months after the accident when we could have hoped for better progress."
Bianchi admitted that if Jules did awake from his coma, it could lead to added difficulties.
He revealed that, prior to his son's accident, the two had spoken about the condition of seven-time Formula 1 world champion Michael Schumacher, who suffered severe head injuries in a skiing accident in December 2013 and faces a long road to recovery.
Philippe Bianchi said: "If he had a severe handicap, we are convinced that is not what Jules would want.
"We talked about it. He discussed with us that if one day he had an accident like that of Michael Schumacher, that even if his only handicap was not being able to drive, he would have a lot of difficulty living. Because it was his life."
Jules Bianchi joined Marussia in 2013 and raced in 34 grands prix, scoring two championship points in last year's Monaco Grand Prix.
Marussia came close to collapse over the winter but were rescued and are racing as Manor in 2015.

Article: Tunisia had faced expulsion from the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations until apologising to Caf for complaints it lodged against the organisation during this year's Nations Cup.
Morocco, meanwhile, were only able to enter the 2017 Nations Cup qualifying draw after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) overturned a ban on its participation.
We are preparing for a future full of good things for both Africa and Morocco
"We are preparing for a future full of good things for both Africa and Morocco," said Moroccan FA chief Fouzi Lekjaa.
"We are back after a little break of a few months, but it has not had a big impact. The impact was minimal and we were, along with our Caf colleagues, able to make it pass."
Morocco were punished in February after being replaced as 2015 Nations Cup hosts last November, just two months before the competition began.
The North Africans refused to stage the tournament in January 2015, citing fears over importing the Ebola virus, and asked for a postponement of either six or twelve months instead.
Earlier this month, Cas overturned Caf's ruling and reduced a fine imposed on Morocco's FA from $1m (£675,000) to $50,000 (£34,000).
Equatorial Guinea stepped in to stage the 2015 finals, despite having just 64 days to prepare.
The host nation was also at the centre of the incident that led to Tunisia's row with Caf, which the local federation (FTF) says is now over.
"I am convinced that the page has been turned and that there will no longer by any problems," FTF vice-president Maher Snoussi told BBC Sport.
Seeking their first Nations Cup triumph since 2004, the Tunisians were leading 1-0 in the 90th minute of their quarter-final against the hosts when they were awarded a highly contentious penalty.
The spot-kick was converted and Equatorial Guinea went on to win 2-1 in extra-time, as the Tunisian players and bench largely lost their heads as tempers flared.
The Tunisians wrote a furious letter to Caf in response, which prompted African football's ruling body to demand an apology by 31 March 2015 or face disqualification from the next Nations Cup.
Contrary to media reports, the Tunisia Football Federation insists it never accused Caf nor Mauritian referee Rajindraparsad Seechurn of corruption.
"We never spoke of corruption because we had no evidence," said Snoussi.
"But we were strongly convinced that the referee sought out an unjustifiable penalty, and that perhaps he was influenced by the atmosphere inside the stadium."
"But we never accused either him or any Caf member of corruption. "We simply said the referee was very badly chosen and we contested that a 45-year-old, coming towards the end of his international career, should have been selected.
"In our famous letter, we said that the commission in charge of appointing referees had to assume responsibility for appointing a referee incapable of handling the match."
Tunisia's 2017 participation seemed in doubt until a meeting with Caf president Issa Hayatou and others in Senegal in mid-March led to a rapprochement.
"Luckily, with the strong pressure of Issa Hayatou, with whom I had a meeting in Dakar where we discussed our difference, we've managed to turn the page," said Snoussi.
"We are very happy to be playing the (2017) Nations Cup and I feel this difference has been now completely ironed out."
Following last week's draw in Cairo, Tunisia will face Togo, Liberia and Djibouti in Group A while Morocco will Cape Verde, Libya and Sao Tome in Group F.
Should the Tunisians reach the 2017 finals in Gabon, they will reach their thirteenth straight Nations Cup - which would be a record.

Tunisia and Morocco's differences with the Confederation of African Football (Caf) are in the past, both North African nations say.

Article: Jordan Hill, Brittany Covington and Tesfaye Cooper, all 18, and Tanishia Covington, 24, appeared in a Chicago court on Friday.
The four have been charged with hate crimes and aggravated kidnapping and battery, among other things.
An online fundraiser for their victim has collected $51,000 (Â£42,500) so far.
Denying the four suspects bail, Judge Maria Kuriakos Ciesil asked: "Where was your sense of decency?"
Prosecutors told the court the beating started in a van and continued at a house, where the suspects allegedly forced the 18-year-old white victim, who suffers from schizophrenia and attention deficit disorder, to drink toilet water and kiss the floor.
Police allege the van was earlier stolen by Mr Hill, who is also accused of demanding $300 from the victim's mother while they held him captive, according to the Chicago Tribune.
The court was also told the suspects stuffed a sock into his mouth, taped his mouth shut and bound his hands with a belt.
In a video made for Facebook Live which was watched millions of times, the assailants can be heard making derogatory statements against white people and Donald Trump.
The victim had been dropped off at a McDonalds to meet Mr Hill - who was one of his friends - on 31 December.
He was found by a police officer on Tuesday, 3 January, a day after he was reported missing by his parents.
Prosecutors say the suspects each face two hate crimes counts, one because of the victim's race and the other because of his disabilities.

Article: Jamie Cox was sentenced to 26 weeks for common assault after he attacked Viktoria Gribovskaja at her home in Lambeth, south London last year.
The Swindon-based WBO European super-middleweight title holder had denied assault.
His sentence was suspended at an appeal at Croydon Magistrates' Court.
The 29-year-old boxer, who appeared in court under his real name Jamie Russan was told his conviction still stands, but that his prison sentence will be suspended for 18 months.
Recorder Joseph Boothby told him he should treat the suspended sentence as "a turning point" and said: "Change your ways and think before you get angry with a girlfriend, or anyone else for that matter."
Cox had been sentenced to 26 weeks in prison for the assault and harassment charges, 20 weeks for violence to secure entry and 12 weeks for criminal damage, to run concurrently.
He is currently ranked number four in the world and is also a Commonwealth Games light welterweight champion.
After the hearing, Cox said: "I just want to get back to normal and to fight for world titles. I do not really treat today as a success."

Article: Restoring the function of the organ - which helps control blood sugar levels - reversed symptoms of diabetes in animal experiments.
The study, published in the journal Cell, says the diet reboots the body.
Experts said the findings were "potentially very exciting" as they could become a new treatment for the disease.
The experiments were on mice put on a modified form of the "fasting-mimicking diet".
When people go on it they spend five days on a low calorie, low protein, low carbohydrate but high unsaturated-fat diet.
It resembles a vegan diet with nuts and soups, but with around 800 to 1,100 calories a day.
Then they have 25 days eating what they want - so overall it mimics periods of feast and famine.
Previous research has suggested it can slow the pace of ageing.
But animal experiments showed the diet regenerated a special type of cell in the pancreas called a beta cell.
These are the cells that detect sugar in the blood and release the hormone insulin if it gets too high.
Dr Valter Longo, from the University of Southern California, said: "Our conclusion is that by pushing the mice into an extreme state and then bringing them back - by starving them and then feeding them again - the cells in the pancreas are triggered to use some kind of developmental reprogramming that rebuilds the part of the organ that's no longer functioning."
There were benefits in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes in the mouse experiments.
Type 1 is caused by the immune system destroying beta cells and type 2 is largely caused by lifestyle and the body no longer responding to insulin.
Further tests on tissue samples from people with type 1 diabetes produced similar effects.
Dr Longo said: "Medically, these findings have the potential to be very important because we've shown - at least in mouse models - that you can use diet to reverse the symptoms of diabetes.
"Scientifically, the findings are perhaps even more important because we've shown that you can use diet to reprogram cells without having to make any genetic alterations."
BBC reporter Peter Bowes took part in a separate trial with Dr Valter Longo.
He said: "During each five-day fasting cycle, when I ate about a quarter of the average person's diet, I lost between 2kg and 4kg (4.4-8.8lbs).
"But before the next cycle came round, 25 days of eating normally had returned me almost to my original weight.
"But not all consequences of the diet faded so quickly."
His blood pressure was lower as was a hormone called IGF-1, which is linked to some cancers.
He said: "The very small meals I was given during the five-day fast were far from gourmet cooking, but I was glad to have something to eat"
Peter Bowes: Fasting for science
Peter Bowes: Intermittent fasting and the good things it did to my body
Separate trials of the diet in people have been shown to improve blood sugar levels. The latest findings help to explain why.
However, Dr Longo said people should not rush off and crash diet.
He told the BBC: "It boils down to do not try this at home, this is so much more sophisticated than people realise."
He said people could "get into trouble" with their health if it was done without medical guidance.
Dr Emily Burns, research communications manager at Diabetes UK, said: "This is potentially very exciting news, but we need to see if the results hold true in humans before we'll know more about what it means for people with diabetes.
"People with type-1 and type-2 diabetes would benefit immensely from treatments that can repair or regenerate insulin-producing cells in the pancreas."

Article: Fleetwood shot a four-under-par 68 to keep pace with fellow overnight leader Brooks Koepka at Erin Hills, while Harman carded a 67 to lead on 12 under.
Paul Casey, who also started on seven under, fell away with a three-over 75.
Justin Thomas is tied for second after becoming the first man to shoot a nine-under-par round at the US Open and the fifth 63 in its 117-year history.
There had been four other 63s in US Open history before this week. Jonny Miller hit the first on the par-71 Oakmont in 1973, while Jack Nicklaus and Tom Weiskopf's efforts came on the par-70 Baltusrol in 1980.
Fiji's Vijay Singh also recorded a seven-under 63, at Olympia Fields in 2003.
The US Open tournament organisers have historically prided themselves on trying to make the winning score as close to level par as possible.
However, heavy overnight rain dumped an inch of water on the course and that undoubtedly helped low scoring with players able to take advantage of receptive greens and attack the holes.
Thomas opened his round with two birdies before dropping a shot on the fourth. Four more birdies followed on the front nine before another bogey on the 10th looked to have put paid to his chances of breaking Miller's 44-year-old record.
But after three birdies in six holes, he eagled the 667-yard par-five 18th, hitting his second shot to eight feet from 300 yards and rolling in the downhill putt.
Southport's Fleetwood, who finished tied for 27th on his only other US Open appearance in 2015, appeared to be heading towards his second bogey-free round of the tournament after laying up with his second shot on the par-five 18th.
However, he left his chip to the green short and then putted through the green and off it with his fourth shot. A sublime chip to three feet allowed him to escape with just his third bogey of the week.
"That was the best shot I hit all day," Fleetwood told BBC Sport.
"I hadn't been out of position all day and suddenly I was staring double bogey in the face.
"Bad shots make bogeys and 18 was a good example. I could still have been there now, hitting the ball over the green. But I hit the perfect shot and I was made up when I got on the green.
"Three days down and so far so good."
Fellow Englishman Casey was one of the four overnight leaders but he fared the worst, posting a triple bogey for the second day running as he dropped out of contention.
His downfall began with an errant second shot on the par-four third into deep rough. That led to a seven and a further shot went on the next hole.
On Friday, the 39-year-old responded with a run of five successive birdies but he was unable to replicate that on Saturday, as he ended the round on four under par.
Home players occupy 12 of the top 16 places on the leaderboard and with six shots separating them, any one could still win on Sunday.
None of the dozen have won a major, and neither have the four non-Americans (Fleetwood, Kim Si-woo, Bernd Wiesberger and Hideki Matsuyama).
Harman, who is bidding to become the first left-hander to win the US Open, knocked in six birdies.
The 30-year-old, who won the Wells Fargo tournament last month, said: "I've been striking the ball so well and giving myself chances so I'll just try to keep doing what I've been doing.
"I'll definitely think about the mindset I had in winning Wells Fargo a few weeks ago."
Big-hitting Koepka, who averaged 320 yards with his driver on Saturday, had five birdies in his four-under round.
Rickie Fowler had a run of three successive birdies from the 14th as the leader from the first round shot a four-under 68 to get to 10 under and just two off the lead.
Patrick Reed's seven-under 65 featured eight birdies and one bogey as he improved to eight under.
He said he felt like he "hit the ball better" in Friday's second round, despite taking 10 fewer strokes on Saturday.
Reed explained: "I was really seeing the lines and had the speed. And most of my birdie putts were uphill and I could attack. On Friday it was the opposite."
Russell Henley (67) and Charley Hoffman (68) are all in a group four off the lead on eight under.
However, not all Americans fared well. Jordan Spieth, the 2015 champion, started the day level par and was still on that mark after a couple of birdies cancelled out two bogeys in his opening 11 holes.
Two more bogeys followed though and a double-bogey on the par-five 18th saw him finish four-over after a 76.
"It's been an off-week for me with the putting," said the former world number one. "I've been striking the ball well.
"It's just been trying to figure it out on and around the greens. And I feel like once the can gets open, I'll start pouring them in."
Germany's Martin Kaymer, winner in 2014, took 41 shots to complete the front nine and although he picked up two birdies on the back nine, his three-over 75 saw him drop back to level par.
And two-time winner Ernie Els, who was two under after round one, dropped five shots in his opening six holes on Saturday. The South African rallied with an eagle two on the par-four 15th but had a triple-bogey seven on the 17th to drop to five over after a 79.
England's Eddie Pepperell, 26, had five birdies and two bogeys in his three-under-par 69 to get to four under and remain in with a chance.
After dropping three shots in his opening six holes, Matt Fitzpatrick holed five birdies in eight holes to post a two-under 70 to climb to three under.
Fellow Englishman Andrew Johnston mixed three birdies with four bogeys as he slipped back to one under with a 73.
And Scotland's Martin Laird is putting together a solid tournament with nine birdies and nine bogeys in his opening three rounds.
However, it looks like Lee Westwood's wait to win a major will go on to The Open in July. The Englishman was three under after round one, but he followed Friday's 75 with another 75 today to drop to three over.
More to follow.

Article: But there certainly should be.
These are two of the biggest firms in the lucrative international business of making spectacles. France's Essilor is the world's number one manufacturer of lenses and contact lenses, while Italy's Luxottica is the leading frame manufacturer.
It is not obvious that the merger is in the public interest, though the two firms certainly think it is.
"The parties' activities are highly complementary and the deal would generate significant synergies and innovation and would be beneficial to customers," says Essilor.
But there seems to be growing disquiet in the industry.
Gordon Ilett, of the Association of Optometrists, says: "This now allows the [enlarged] group to control all aspects of supply of product - from manufacture to the end user.
"Those businesses who remain as their customers will be indirectly controlled by the terms and conditions imposed by them.
"Whether their UK market share, following this merger, is sufficient for examination by the competition authorities is open to debate, but the effect of it will be reduced choice for the consumer, and will most likely result in reduced quality products longer term," Mr Ilett adds.
If the deal goes through later this year the new company, to be called EssilorLuxottica, will become a behemoth of the industry.
It will sell not only lenses and frames around the world but will also be stocking its own optician's shops as well, such as Sunglass Hut, and LensCrafters in the US and Australia, both currently owned by Luxottica.
One long-standing independent UK wholesaler, who asked to remain anonymous, says the merged firm would be so powerful it would probably squeeze out some competitors.
"If those two companies merged there would be a branded frame supplier offering you high-end branded frames, and also offering UK opticians a lens and glazing deal, to suit, so they will control almost everything [they offer] to both independent retailers in the High Street and even the chains," he argues.
In his view this would amount, almost, to a stranglehold on the supply of high-end glasses, with some rivals giving up.
"I imagine it would knock out quite a few glazing houses in the UK, and it would probably knock out other fashion frame houses," he adds.
Unless you know about the eyewear business, or take an interest in investing in big European companies (they both have stock market listings) the names of the two big firms will probably have passed you by.
But if you have been inside an optician's shop you will certainly have heard of the brands they own and make. For instance, the leading varifocal lens brand, Varilux, is made by Essilor.
Just a year ago, in presenting its 2015 financial results to investors, Essilor boasted that it was "an undisputed leader with only 25% market share" of the combined world market for prescription lenses, sunglasses lenses and lenses for reading glasses.
When it comes to just the prescription lenses, it has a 41% share of the world market.
For its part, Luxottica owns several of its own brand names such as Ray-Ban and Oakley, and it also makes, under licence, spectacle frames which carry high-fashion names such as Armani, Burberry, Bulgari, Chanel, Prada, Ralph Lauren and Versace.
In 2015 the Italian firm made almost 10% of the 954 million frames that were sold worldwide that year, and claims that about half a billion of its frames are currently perched on people's noses.
The overall industry internationally is in fact quite fragmented with hundreds of other smaller manufacturers and related businesses such as glazing laboratories.
Market research firm GFK describes the optical industry as "a complex and extremely competitive market-space".
Even so, with the two firms having a combined turnover of more than 15bn euros (Â£12.8bn), of which 3.5bn euros were in Europe, on the grounds of size alone the proposed merger easily meets the requirements of the European Commission for a formal review.
These are:
An inquiry would see if the merged firm threatened to be too dominant, thus reducing competition and leading to higher prices for the customers.
A Luxottica spokesman told the BBC that the firm was confident that any scrutiny would not hinder the deal.
"The transaction is subject to mandatory submission to a number of anti-monopoly authorities including the European one, as is customary in transactions of this size and nature," he said.
"We are confident that the transaction does not raise anti-monopoly issues and will fully co-operate with the anti-monopoly authorities to obtain the required clearance," he added.
The EU itself says it currently has no comment to make and it has not yet been formally notified of the merger deal under the requirements of its own rules.
But the leading chain of opticians, Specsavers, views the impending deal with caution.
"Mergers are a continuing trend in optics, but this is a significant development which will result in huge supply chain and retail implications for the industry and consumers worldwide," the firm says.
"It is unlikely that the impact of the merger will be felt by consumers straight away but we will watch with great interest how the new organisation will arrange itself."
If you have ever bought a pair of spectacles with anything other than the most basic frame and lenses, you may have gulped at the price, possibly coming to several hundred pounds.
Of course, not all spectacles are expensive and not all of the sale price goes to the manufacturers.
Opticians and the wholesalers that supply them are businesses that seek to make a profit.
They also need to cover the costs of staff, equipment, shop and office space, stock and all that advertising.
But for the manufacturers such as Essilor and Luxottica, it is a stonkingly profitable business.
On worldwide sales of 6.7bn euros in 2015, Essilor made operating profits of 1.2bn euros.
For the same year, Luxottica sold goods worth 8.8bn euros and made operating profits of 1.4bn euros.
With cost-cutting at a merged business projected to save between 400m and 600m euros per year, profits could be boosted even further.
Will customers benefit as well?

"It was a stupid idea when I think of it but I didn't know it was going to end in the way that it did."
He said he did not inflict any injuries and he did not see how Mr Mason suffered 22 stab wounds.
He added he only discovered Mr Mason had been stabbed when he was told as they drove away.
The case continues.

The Olympic silver medallist accused the organisation of "ageism" and having "zero regard" for her welfare.
She is the latest high-profile cyclist to come forward after Jess Varnish, Nicole Cooke and Emma Pooley criticised the World Class programme.
Houvenaghel told the BBC she felt "vindicated" by a leaked draft report detailing British Cycling's failures.
The report said British Cycling "sanitised" its own investigation into claims former technical director Shane Sutton used sexist language towards Varnish, who went public last April about her treatment.
British Cycling subsequently admitted it did not pay "sufficient care and attention" to the wellbeing of staff and athletes at the expense of winning medals, an approach Houvenaghel attested to in her BBC interview.
Both Sutton and predecessor Sir Dave Brailsford have now left British Cycling.
Houvenaghel, 42, spoke to BBC Sport during its State of Sport week, which on Thursday examines the issue of athlete welfare versus a win-at-all-costs culture.
A government-commissioned review, headed by 11-time Paralympic champion Baroness Grey-Thompson, into safety and wellbeing in British sport, is due to be published imminently.
It is expected to recommend significant reforms designed to improve the way athletes are treated by governing bodies.
Houvenaghel claimed:
British Cycling said it "has acknowledged and takes very seriously previous cultural and governance failings in the World Class Programme".
It said it has accepted the draft report's findings and already put into a place a 39-point action plan to "systematically address the cultural and behavioural shortcomings".
The statement added: "Our new chair Jonathan Browning has apologised for instances where we have fallen short in our commitment to athlete welfare and has offered to meet with anyone who can help improve British Cycling."
Who else has spoken out?
Houvenaghel won silver in the individual pursuit at the Beijing Olympics in 2008, and gold in the World Championship team pursuit in 2008, 2009 and 2011.
She retired in 2014, aged 39, after withdrawing from the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow with a back injury.
Houvenaghel was critical of both Sutton and her team-mates in the aftermath of the London 2012 Olympics, where she was left out of all three team pursuit races as Dani King, Laura Trott and Joanna Rowsell-Shand won gold in a world record time.
Speaking to BBC Sport this week, the Northern Irish rider said that experience was "very traumatic" and she felt "torment" at having "no explanation" for her last-minute omission.
At the time, Brailsford, then performance director, defended the selection saying they had to "take the personal element out of it, and look at the data and be professional".
He added: "I think when a team steps up and makes six world records on the trot and a gold medal, then I don't think you can argue with that."
British Cycling reiterated that point on Thursday, adding it was "proud to support Wendy in what was a wonderfully successful cycling career" and she was "part of a pioneering generation of riders who set new standards of excellence", but was dropped in London 2012 "based on her performance".
Other elite cyclists, including King and Roswell-Shand have praised the leadership at British Cycling.
Asked whether she was simply not good enough for the 2012 team, Houvenaghel replied: "It was definitely not about performance. I don't think the fastest team on the day were permitted to race.
"There are certain chosen riders on the team who will not have experienced the culture of fear and will not have been on the receiving end of that - the bullying, the harassment, being frozen out of opportunities.
"It was horrid - it was not the training environment I expected. There was no choice. If you rocked the boat, you were out. There was no alternative.
"Medals at any cost, that's how it was whenever I was there, certainly in 2012."
Houvenaghel said she also witnessed the sexism that has been highlighted by other female riders, and also claims she was discriminated against because of her age.
"I can certainly relate to the bullying," she said. "For me personally, I felt it was more ageism - being a little bit older than my team-mates, it didn't seem to be something that the staff necessarily wanted for our team in 2012.
"They didn't care about what happened to me afterwards. I never heard another thing from them.
"After six years of constantly medalling at World Cups, World Championships, nationals, both on the track and on the road, they discarded me in a very undignified way from the team, which I don't feel was right."
Fourteen-time Paralympic gold medallist Dame Sarah Storey told BBC Sport that elite level sport in Britain is "cut-throat" but there are "no excuses for crossing that line" into bullying.
Asked about the balance between winning and athlete welfare, the 39-year-old replied: "It's a really difficult question because you have to be a human being, you have to allow for people to make mistakes. But the currency is race wins, the currency is gold medals.
"It's not an excuse but you have to have a thick skin in sport, you have to be able to take the rough with the smooth because of the racing that you go through.
"But there are no excuses for crossing that line, and if those lines have been crossed they will be found out and they'll be dealt with."

Article: After last year's test which focused on a collapse in house prices in the UK, this year's test will have a more international flavour.
Under the scenario, global growth will fall, the Chinese economy slow markedly and the UK and the eurozone will face a new bout of recession with rising unemployment and falling property prices.
In Britain, the economy will contract by 2.3%.
As the Bank grapples with the new crisis, interest rates in the UK are cut to zero.
And as the global economy slumps, the oil price collapses to $38 and deflation - causing companies to withdraw investment - "increases the real burden of debt and increases market concerns".
The world would see the worst levels of deflation since the 1930s.
Some major global banks and companies could default on debt repayments.
To be clear, the Bank's five-year scenario does not mean it believes these events will happen.
This is what is called a "tail-risk" event. It could happen but the probability is exceedingly low.
But then again, no-one predicted the severity of the financial crisis.
And actually this scenario is not as bad as what actually happened in 2008, even though it is put in place to try to stop those calamitous events ever occurring again.
Six banks will have their balance sheets tested against this stress test - HSBC, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds, Santander UK and Standard Chartered.
The building society Nationwide will also be tested.
Many believe that this will be a tougher test for banks with large international businesses - HSBC and Standard Chartered - than the UK domestic test of last year.
Co-op Bank, a mainly UK bank, has been dropped from this year's test.
"Last year's stress test demonstrated how much stronger the core of the UK financial system has become since the financial crisis," said Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England.
"This year's test will have a different focus.
"By assessing the resilience of the UK banking system against a major external shock, we will improve further our ability to identify vulnerabilities and we will ensure that banks have plans in place to address a wider range of possible stresses.
"We are committed to ensuring our major banks are resilient [and] that they can weather shocks without calling on tax payer support."
Under the scenario, banks will be obliged to continue lending to the UK economy, one of the biggest risks of a global turndown.
The results of the tests, which bank officials believe are "severe", will be published in December.
Banks might then be required to raise more capital to strengthened their balance sheets.
One big missing piece of the stress test is a break up of the eurozone.
That might seem odd, given events in Greece.
But Bank officials explain that the eurozone is a more immediate issue and that the direct exposure of the UK banks to Greece is low at about £2bn.
Put simply, British banks should already have in place the mechanisms to deal with a eurozone break-up.

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence.
The Bank of England has outlined its annual "stress test" - the exam Britain's major banks must go through to ensure they have enough available capital to withstand a global downturn.

Article: It's no joke. But Kareem Badr says people did laugh in 2009 when he and two friends paid $20,000 (Â£13,000) for the Hideout in Austin, when it wasn't making money and the previous owner decided not to renew the lease.
"We took over a sinking ship and each brought a bucket to bail it out," says Mr Badr.
"None of us had any experience of running a business. But we loved what we were doing enough that it carried us through."
Three years ago he was able to quit his day job and draw a salary from the club.
Mr Badr says it's still not as much as he used to make as a programmer (about $80,000 a year), but he now employs around 25 part time and contract workers.
And he recently expanded the premises, taking over the adjoining coffee house which sells alcohol, and leasing more theatre space.
Mr Badr says: "I think my background in computer science helped because I can take a big problem, break it up into small chunks, and figure out how to make it better and more efficient.
"That's basically what we did for every aspect of the business. And by doing that it naturally started to improve."
Mr Badr may have been helped by national trends, which imply a growing enthusiasm for comedy clubs in the US.
An industry report from data firm Ibis World expects total US annual comedy club revenue to grow by 1.8% over the next five years to $344.6m in 2020.
"When the Hideout first opened it was the only improv theatre in Austin," says Mr Badr.
"But now there are five [comedy] schools and four theatres. We were at the right place at the right time."
While the Ibis World report showed that dozens of US comedy clubs were forced to close in the wake of the 2008 recession, when fewer people had disposable income to spend on live entertainment, Stephen Rosenfield, director of the American Comedy Institute in New York, says stand-up comedy is now entering a new golden age.
"The US has comedy clubs all over the country, not just in big cities, and they require talent," he says.
"In any field there are those at the top who make dynastic fortunes. But because of the significance of the local comedy club, there is a career and a living to be made by good comedians who are not superstars."
Mr Rosenfield says the growing popularity of stand-up comedy is fuelled in part by younger audiences, who view humorous TV hosts such as Jon Stewart, Jay Leno and Steve Colbert as their primary source for news.
"It's not just entertaining them, it's also informing them," he says. "There's a new immediacy to stand-up that makes it much more appealing to a generation that's on social media, tweeting, face booking and blogging."
But clubs don't only make money from entertainers. Alcohol alone can bring in as much as 40% of the night's takings, and many clubs demand that audiences buy a minimum number of drinks per person.
"A club really has three businesses going on," says Mr Rosenfield.
"It's an entertainment entity, a restaurant and a bar. They make money from selling drinks and dinners, and they make money from the cover charge.
"There are usually three people on the bill. The opening act is the new comedian. They do about 20 minutes and introduce the other comics.
The middle act does about half an hour, and then there's the headliner. They almost always have TV credits, and are the ones people are coming to see. That headliner could be making six figures a year."
Top-tier performers make much more. According to Forbes, Canadian comedian Russell Peters grossed $19m with 64 shows in 2013, while industry veteran Jerry Seinfeld is the highest paid comedian in the US, set to earn $36m this year.
Steve Byrne, 41, is a veteran stand-up comedian based in LA, and star of his own television show Sullivan and Son, which ran for three seasons.
He describes himself as a successful mid-level comedian who makes an annual six figure salary mainly from touring.
And although he was close to hitting a million dollars a year before his show was cancelled in 2014, he says most comedians make money at clubs and do television to boost their brand rather than their income.
Mr Bryne says: "Gigs vary because it depends what you're contracted at.
"If it's somebody starting off in the business it could be $1,500 a show. For somebody who's had some TV credits you could go from $4,500 to $7,500.
"And if you're just a knock out comic, then you're coming in and getting a door deal. You're taking all the tickets, and the club gets the concessions."
Mr Byrne says hard work is the key to success. There is no magic short cut, and few lucky breaks.
"The one single thing that an aspiring comedian should do is write, write, write. What is it that makes you laugh?
"Your voice should resonate with your audience. So find your voice and you will find your audience."
While the music and film industries have been impacted by the internet, such as illegal downloads and reduced album sales, Mr Rosenfield says the online world has actually given live comedy a boost.
"The format of comedy, particularly stand-up, lends itself to digital media like nothing else. One terrific joke can get a million hits," he says.
"It's become a new metric for a club manager. If a booker sees that a comic has 500,000 online followers - they'll book him almost sight unseen. That's it.
"Digital is gigantically important and has been for a while."
But in the end, the success of comedy comes down to a very simple fact - people need to laugh.
Back in 2001 Steve Byrne was a comedian in New York when terrorists flew two planes into the World Trade Centre on 11 September.
He says: "We all thought 'who's going to come to a comedy club? The dream's over, I've got to get a real job now'.
"But after a week, I forget which club was the first one to open its doors, but it was packed. People needed an outlet.
"And I remember for months on end those clubs in New York City were just jam packed. That was the thing that told me that this was a profession that is foolproof."

Article: Relieved that the giant telecoms company would not be broken up, they piled into the shares, sending them up 3% in early trading.
BT dodged a bullet - and, as the chief executive of Ofcom, Sharon White, admitted, it was for prosaic reasons.
She said complications with land deals and BT's giant pension scheme meant there were "practical obstacles" to a break-up that would delay the process several years.
It's the pension scheme that probably most influenced Ofcom's thinking. BT's retirement scheme, inherited from its time as a state-owned utility, has assets of about Â£40bn and a deficit, on some measures, of about Â£10bn, even though BT has poured in billions of pounds in recent years to redress the gap.
Senior sources at the company say that about 80% of the scheme relates to Openreach, the internet infrastructure provider that BT's rivals would like to see spun off.
Separating the pension as part of a break-up would be a costly headache - and there is the small matter of a government guarantee on part of the scheme, something that BT fought in the courts to preserve and won.
Creating two new pension schemes, with the risk of weakening the financial resources of one or the other, might be too hot a political potato, even in the pursuit of faster broadband.
BT's share price reaction might turn out to be overdone. Ms White plans to enforce the separation by introducing not only a new board to run Openreach, but also new articles of association that will give directors a duty to serve customers of the network as much as the company's owners.
This holds out an obvious prospect of conflicts to come, and runs counter to the normal assumption that in private companies, the shareholder is king.
It also carries an echo of the "golden shares" held by the government in Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems, two companies judged important for the defence of the realm. In each case, the golden share is actually enshrined by specific articles of association that give directors and the government powers beyond those normally enjoyed by company boards.
BT's chief executive, Gavin Patterson, said he thought he could reach a compromise with Ofcom, but admitted they would need to see the detail of the new articles.
If they prove too much at odds with BT's own desire to control Openreach - which it will still own - get ready for a court battle and perhaps, eventually, a full break-up.

Article: The hosts closed on 152-3, a lead of 128, after 10 wickets fell in the day.
Mehedi Hasan Miraz (6-82) reduced England to 144-8 but Chris Woakes and Adil Rashid put on 99 to give England a first-innings lead of 24.
However, Imrul Kayes hit an unbeaten 59 and Mohammad Mahmudullah made 47 as Bangladesh regained the initiative.
Mahmudullah was bowled by England debutant Zafar Ansari with the final ball of the day after the left-arm spinner had earlier dismissed Tamim Iqbal for his first international wicket.
Bangladesh's only victories since their first Test in 2000 have come against Zimbabwe and the West Indies.
BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew
Another fluctuating Test sees England on the back foot and Bangladesh once again contemplating victory.
England's bowlers created little pressure and it isn't immediately obvious who will step up tomorrow morning to bowl Bangladesh out. What is certain is that 250 would take some getting and Bangladesh are well on course for setting England a real challenge.
Mehedi, 19, tormented England in the first Test in Chittagong and became only the third spinner to take five wickets in the first innings of each of his first two Test matches.
Having taken two wickets on day one to reduce England to 50-3, off-spinner Mehedi bowled Moeen Ali in the third over of the day, with the England all-rounder playing an ill-advised sweep.
Ben Stokes was out in the following over, caught off Taijul Islam, bringing Jonny Bairstow to the crease.
He put on 45 with Joe Root to steady the visitors after they had slipped to 69-5, but Mehedi returned to trap Bairstow lbw for 24 with his first ball of a new spell - and then had Ansari caught at gully for his fifth wicket of the innings.

Root batted well to score his 23rd Test half-century, but when Taijul took his wicket England were rocking at 144-8.
However, Woakes (46) and Rashid (44) excelled as Bangladesh captain Mushfiqur Rahim rotated his bowlers, their partnership of 224 balls and 127 minutes taking England from a deficit of 76 into the lead.
The stand was England's highest for the ninth wicket in Asia and was in stark contrast to the Bangladesh innings, where they fell from 171-1 to 220 all out.
The partnership perhaps should have been cut short, though.
Woakes, on 38 at the time, hit a high full toss from Sabbir Rahman straight to the mid-wicket fielder, but he was given a reprieve when TV umpire Chris Gaffaney judged that the ball had reached the batsman above waist height and gave a no-ball, despite later replays suggesting the wicket should have stood.
Woakes was eventually out when Mehedi returned with the new ball and claimed his sixth wicket, while Steven Finn was the last man out for 0 off the bowling of Taijul.
Bangladesh's openers Tamim and Kayes batted positively in the final session to wipe out England's lead, reaching 65 before Ansari dismissed Tamim to claim his first Test wicket.
England captain Alastair Cook then caught Mominul Haque at slip off Stokes in next over and the tourists seemed to have the momentum.
However, Kayes and Mahmudullah played freely to put on 86 before Mahmudullah played a loose attacking shot and was bowled by Ansari with what turned out to be the final ball of the day.
Bangladesh scored at almost five runs per over in the final session as Finn and Rashid, both wicketless in the first innings, went at six runs per over, while Woakes conceded 14 from his two overs.
England all-rounder Chris Woakes on BBC Test Match Special: "That wicket at the end gives us a bit of hope going into tomorrow. I think we've had a reasonably good day.
"We'd have liked to have got a few more runs early on this morning but the partnership between myself and Rash got us up ahead of them.
"I don't think the pitch will get any better - it will only get worse, if anything. We've got a long batting line-up but we don't want to chase too many.
"It's important when we come out tomorrow we firstly try to keep the run rate down so they don't get away from us, but also look to take wickets. It's a tricky thing to do.
"If we can pick up a few early ones, we know they can roll easily."

Article: "I'm really looking forward to it - the home of Scottish football," said Rodgers ahead of his maiden visit.
"I hear the pitch is good, a nice big pitch suits the speed in our team and our intensity.
"The technical area goes right out to the end of the pitch, but you might need a taxi to get back to your staff."
This will be Rodgers' second taste of the Old Firm derby and his experience of the fixture got off to a great start with a 5-1 league victory at Celtic Park last month.
"It was a brilliant performance by the players in every aspect," he recalled. "Obviously this one is on a neutral ground, but we'll be looking to have a similar performance.
"We'll be prepared and focused. We know it's going to be a tough game. We anticipated that the last time."
Rodgers is also aware Celtic's visit to Hampden last season in the Scottish Cup semi-final against Rangers ended in defeat.
"The last experience there wasn't so good for Celtic," he said. "But it's a different team with a different mentality and we'll look to take that mentality into the game."
Rodgers lost two semi-finals in his time at Liverpool and is aiming to make it third time lucky at the club he joined in the summer.
"You have to perform - that's what's important and if you get little bit of luck along the way then hopefully you'll get the result that you want." said the Northern Irishman.
"So, for us, it's really looking at our performance level, which in the main has been at a really high level.
"My focus is always on my own team and, if we impose our style of play, it can give a lot of problems to opponents."
Unlike predecessor Ronny Deila, Rodgers would not be drawn on this semi-final being a step on the way to a potential domestic treble.
"It's very, very difficult to achieve," he said. "There's been great managers here in the past that haven't achieved that.
"But it's the first competition where we've a chance to win a trophy and I've always said that it's a priority for us because it's the first one.
"Our idea was to qualify for the Champions League, which we did, to make a good start in the league, which we've done, and then look to get to the League Cup final.
"Unless you can do that then you don't have the chance to win the trophies."

Article: The Beyond Caravaggio exhibition features the work of the Italian artist and 30 other artists from all over Europe who were influenced by him.
It is a collaboration with the National Galleries in London and Dublin.
Edinburgh is the last stop for the works inspired by the man known as the "bad boy" of early 17th Century art.
This is the first exhibition of works by Caravaggio and his followers ever to be shown in Scotland.
Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio was just 39 when he died in 1610.
Four years earlier he had murdered a man after a quarrel over a game of tennis and spent the rest of his life as a fugitive.
Christopher Baker, the acting director of the Scottish National Gallery, told BBC Scotland that Caravaggio was a "revolutionary artist".
He said: "You could see him as the archetypal bad boy artist who in his private life has a tempestuous time, who behaves appallingly, who is often in the courts and who is on the run having committed murder.
"In addition to all of that he is a great creative force.
"He produces these extraordinary pictures, which unsurprisingly, had an extraordinary impact and inspired other painters, who travelled to Rome and Naples from right across Europe and thought 'I need to do that, I want a piece of that as well'.
"That is the story this exhibition tells."
One of the paintings in the exhibition, The Taking of Christ (1602), is from the National Gallery of Ireland, where it is on indefinite loan from the Jesuit Community in Dublin.
It was rediscovered in 1990 in a Jesuits' residence in the Irish capital.
Aidan Weston-Lewis, the curator of exhibition at the Scottish National Gallery, said it was "frustrating" to think that it was offered to the Scottish National Gallery for free in 1921 and turned down.
He said it was the only painting by Caravaggio that has ever been in a Scottish private collection.
It was bought by Scottish country gentleman William Hamilton Nisbet in Rome in 1802, directly from the Mattei family who had commissioned it 200 years earlier.
The painting was on display at Biel House in East Lothian for 120 years.
Mr Weston-Lewis said: "His descendants bequeathed a large group of pictures from that collection to the Scottish National Gallery.
"We didn't have space for them all.
"They were paraded in front of the trustees at the next board meeting and some were selected and some weren't.
"Very sadly from our point of view this painting got away. It was turned down."
Mr Weston-Lewis said the painting had been mistakenly re-attributed to a Caravaggio follower but even so the reputation of the Italian artist was so low at this time that the painting would not have been thought worth saving.
He said: "There was a degree of ignorance. It was only in the middle of the 20th Century that his reputation was resurrected fully.
"Now one could argue he's probably the most popular of all Old Master painters, or certainly up there among them."
Caravaggio's dramatic lighting and compositions, and his radically new approach to subject matter, exerted a huge influence on artists such as Gentileschi, Ribera, Valentin and Ter Brugghen.
Mr Baker said: "It is not just the style of painting but the new types of subject matter, often secular subjects that he excelled at producing, that thrilled other people.
"But also it's gaming, being in pubs, misbehaving, having a good time, this heady world of pleasure comes into painting at this moment through him, and that's what everybody else wants a bit of."
The four paintings by Caravaggio to be shown in the exhibition include The Supper at Emmaus (1601) and Boy bitten by a Lizard (about 1594-5) as well as The Taking of Christ (1602).
Ribera's The Martyrdom of St Bartholomew (1634), which was in the Cranstoun family collection at Corehouse in Lanarkshire for more than 170 years, has been borrowed for this exhibition from the National Gallery of Art in Washington.
Another painting, Christ displaying his Wounds (c.1625-35) by Spadarino, has been borrowed from Perth Museum and Art Gallery.
Beyond Caravaggio is on display at the National Galleries in Scotland from 17 June to 24 September. Entrance to the exhibit costs Â£12.

Article: The move is in response to an £8m cut in the subsidy received from the Department of Employment and Learning (DEL).
The cut in undergraduate places will come into effect from September 2015.
Job losses will be among both academic and non-academic staff and Queen's says no compulsory redundancies should be required.
There are currently around 17,000 full-time undergraduate and postgraduate students at the university, and around 3,800 staff.
Queen's has a current intake of around 4,500 undergraduates per year.
The university aims to reduce the number of student places by 1,010 over the next three years.
The BBC understands that there are no immediate plans to close departments or courses, but that the cuts in funding may put some departments and courses at risk.
The Education Minister Stephen Farry said he recognised that some students might now choose to study in other areas of the UK because of the cuts facing Northern Ireland's universities.
"Some people will now be forced to look to opportunities in other parts of Great Britain and may not return to our economy," he said.
"Defunding our investment in skills, particularly at a time when we're trying to grow the economy does not make a lot of sense. What's happening is we're going backwards.
"The loss of any place is damaging to our economy, all subjects teach our young people critical skills."
Queen's vice-chancellor Patrick Johnston said the cuts had the potential to damage the reputation of the university.
"The potential negative impact, not just on the university but on the local economy is very significant," he said.
"It's the last thing we want to do, but we have to begin to focus on those areas where we can grow the organisation and develop it - it's clear we can no longer depend on the public purse to fund tuition.
"If we're not competitive we will not attract the best students, and we will not attract the best staff."
Just under £100m, a third of the university's income, comes from the Northern Ireland Executive.
DEL's budget was reduced by £62m earlier this year, and its budget for higher education institutions fell from £203m to £186m, a reduction of 8.2%.
Ulster University announced in February that it was dropping 53 courses.
It will be cutting jobs and student places, but it has not yet revealed how many.

Article: Alex Hartley took 4-24 and Katherine Brunt 3-35 as the hosts were bowled out for 155, despite captain Stafanie Taylor's 57.
England looked tense at 56-2 in the chase, but Nat Sciver's unbeaten 58 saw them home with 67 balls to spare.
The victory means England are one win away from World Cup qualification.
That could - and should - be achieved on the tour of Sri Lanka in November, when England will play three matches in the ICC Women's Championship.
Not only have Heather Knight's side moved a step closer to booking a place in the home tournament in 2017, they have secured an impressive series victory in her first overseas tour in charge.
Without wicketkeeper Sarah Taylor, who remains on a break from the game to deal with an anxiety problem, and injured pace bowler Anya Shrubsole, they have beaten the World Twenty20 champions in hot, humid conditions and on slow, spin-friendly surfaces.
It is those conditions that have made run-scoring so difficult and the toss so important - in all four previous matches the side batting first had gone on to win.
England again had to field first, albeit the later sunshine made batting easier in the afternoon, and their bowlers ensured the run-chase would be manageable.
After Brunt and Georgia Elwiss removed Shaquana Quintyne and Hayley Matthews respectively, Hartley and fellow spinner Laura Marsh got to work on the middle order.
With Marsh providing the squeeze from one end, Hartley's accuracy induced poor strokes from Deandra Dottin, Merissa Aguilleira and Shemaine Campbelle.
Taylor once again held the innings together with her third half-century in the five matches, but when she was stumped it gave Hartley a 13th wicket of the series, an England record in ODIs.
With Brunt and off-spinner Knight running through the lower order, West Indies lost their last five wickets for 24 runs.
England were in a strong position chasing 224 in the fourth ODI, only to give away five run-outs in a 42-run defeat.
Here, they were restricted by West Indies' spinners early on, Lauren Winfield chipping Matthews to mid-wicket for 12 and Tammy Beaumont caught and bowled by Afy Fletcher for 34.
With tension rising, the hosts threatened to find a way back into the match, especially with Knight dropped by Anisa Mohammed at short fine leg on only three.
But the skipper combined with Sciver to reverse the pressure, scoring freely down the ground and, at one point, adding 26 runs in three overs.
Though Knight was caught behind off impressive leg-spinner Fletcher, Sciver found an ally in the busy Danielle Wyatt on the way to her sixth ODI half-century.
Wyatt was brilliantly caught at long-on by Britney Cooper, and Elwiss was bowled by Dottin, but there was to be no England wobble, with Amy Jones hitting the runs that sealed the series.
England head coach Mark Robinson told BBC Sport: "It's absolutely outstanding. We've had it tough. It's been ever so humid, red hot, and the wickets have been massively challenging.
"We've come to their back yard, they were on a high after winning the World T20 and we've shown a lot of character. I'm really proud of them.
"Hartley is a tough cookie. She doesn't shy from hard work and she's bowled outstandingly. She's got a big future if she keeps working hard.
"We're a young team and we're learning as we go. We feel we're going in the right direction and we feel we have shown everybody what we're made of."
Ex-England batter Lydia Greenway on BBC Test Match Special:
"England have shown a huge amount of character. Everyone in this series has played their part.
"There have been little turning points in individuals' careers, like Lauren Winfield playing consistently.
"A sign of a good team is showing consistency in all different kinds of situations and I'm sure they will want to carry that on when they go to Sri Lanka."

Article: The leaflets said the patient had been referred for an urgent appointment as their symptoms might indicate cancer.
East Sussex NHS Trust has put the mix-up down to an external company that distributes its printed material.
It said the wrong patient information leaflets were added to hospital appointment letters sent out in March.
It has now contacted everyone affected to apologise and explain what went wrong.
Liz Fellows, assistant director of operations at the trust, said: "It was an administrative error and we apologise for any unnecessary anxiety this error may have caused."
East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust covers Hastings, Eastbourne and Rother, and is responsible for the Conquest Hospital and Eastbourne District Hospital.
The trust said that due to the large number of appointment letters it sends out it uses an external printing company to print and distribute appointment letters.
It said each letter is coded to indicate any supplementary information that needs to accompany it.
Ms Fellows said: "Unfortunately, for a short period in March, the printing company inadvertently miscoded approximately 850 letters resulting in a 'two-week information leaflet' being inserted with an appointment letter.
"As soon as the error became apparent it was stopped immediately, and letters of apology sent out."

Article: Emily Thornberry said Labour would not "frustrate Brexit" even if it failed to amend the bill.
Ten shadow ministers were among 47 Labour MPs who rejected party orders to back it last week.
Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said frontbenchers would have to quit if they defied the whip at the next vote.
The draft legislation comes back to the Commons on Monday for three days of debate culminating in a vote on its third reading.
Speaking on BBC's The Andrew Marr Show, Ms Thornberry rejected a suggestion the party was "hopelessly divided" on the issue.
She said she understood colleagues not wanting to vote in favour of invoking Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which begins the formal departure process, but said: "We have said that we will not frustrate Brexit. We have got our instructions from the British people. We are democrats and the public have voted to leave the European Union."
Labour will try to amend the draft legislation to secure what it calls a "meaningful vote" on the final deal struck between Theresa May and the EU, and to guarantee the status of EU nationals in the UK and Britons living elsewhere in Europe.
Shadow business secretary Clive Lewis has said he will vote against the bill unless Labour's amendments are accepted, describing them as "red lines".
Ms Thornberry declined to say whether they were non-negotiable red lines for her party, and denied it was "illogical" to demand amendments but still back the bill in the final vote if they are rejected.
"There will need to be back channels, private conversations. There are many conversations going on now," she said.
"We are speaking to government, we are speaking to Tory backbenchers and we are trying to get a compromise that will work."
One of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's closest allies, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, missed Wednesday's vote, citing illness.
Former Labour minister Caroline Flint criticised Ms Abbott, telling ITV's Peston on Sunday: "We used to have man flu, we now have Brexit flu that Diane has created hereâ€¦ it's about being part of a team.
"I think she holds one of the most important portfolios within a shadow cabinet. If she can't support the leader on this then she should go."
But former Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman defended Ms Abbott, pointing out she had earlier said on television she would back the bill so had "already taken the flak on it".
Among the rebels in last week's second reading vote were 10 members of the front bench, who would ordinarily be expected to step down after defying leadership instructions to back the bill.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend that changes to his shadow cabinet would be announced "in the coming few days".
Asked if he should be lenient, he added: "I'm a very lenient person."
Speaking later, he said he expected Ms Abbott to vote with the party this week.
Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the shadow cabinet would decide how to approach Wednesday's third reading vote on the Brexit bill.
He told Pienaar's Politics on BBC Radio 5 live that if a three-line whip was again imposed, any frontbenchers who rebelled "will have to step down".

Article: Sevilla, winners of the tournament in 2014 and 2015, led early on through Vitolo's close-range strike.
Marlos equalised with a composed finish from 18 yards before Taras Stepanenko headed the Ukrainian side in front before half-time.
But Kevin Gameiro's late penalty earned the Spaniards a draw.
The French attacker showed no signs of nerves, converting confidently from the spot after Facundo Ferreyra fouled Vitolo just inside the area.
The result leaves Sevilla on course for a third consecutive Europa League success, with the two away goals making them firm favourites to advance to the final in Basel.
No team has won three consecutive European titles since Bayern Munich achieved the feat 40 years ago, and if Unai Emery's side progress from next Thursday's second leg in Spain, only Liverpool or Villarreal stand between them and a piece of history. The first leg of that tie ended 1-0 to Villarreal.
Sevilla have not won away from home all season in La Liga and have managed just one victory on their travels in this competition, so a draw in Lviv represents a fine achievement.
But their home form is excellent - they have won 14 of 18 league games at their Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan Stadium - meaning their bid to become the first team to win the Europa League three times in a row remains very much alive.

Article: Iwan Wyn Lewis of Penygroes, Gwynedd, had been sectioned at Ysbyty Gwynedd after allegedly assaulting his mother.
The 36-year-old was visited by an officer in April 2016 about his bail arrangements, which a doctor said could have added to his distress.
His body was found in the Menai Strait on 2 May.
Mr Lewis was receiving treatment at the hospital's Hergest unit and was later moved to the Cynan ward where he received the visit from the officer.
Speaking at the inquest in Caernarfon on Thursday, consultant psychiatrist Dr Olufemi Adebajo said he was "extremely unhappy" about the visit.
"I don't think the police should be able to come to the ward without special permission," he said.
Asked by coroner Nicola Jones whether the conversation with the officer could have added to Mr Lewis' agitation and distress, Dr Adebajo said: "It's quite possible - even likely".
He said he had known Mr Lewis for more than two years and never considered him to be a suicide risk.
The day before his death, he had asked staff for extra medication because he said he was feeling agitated, but they did not change his dosage because they could see no sign of agitation.
On the evening of 2 May, Mr Lewis told staff he was going to the shop, but 45 minutes later his body was found in the Menai Strait.

Article: Dr Waleed Abdalati told the BBC the that continued access to data is in "everyone's best interest".
Many US scientists are rushing to copy information onto servers outside the control of the federal government.
They are afraid the Trump administration will curb access to climate and other research.
The President-elect has blown hot and cold on the issue of climate change, having previously tweeted about global warming being a hoax.
On Wednesday, one of his advisers compared scientists who support the mainstream view on global warming to flat-Earthers.
"There was an overwhelming science that the Earth was flat and there was an overwhelming science that we were the centre of the world," said Anthony Scaramucci, a member of the Trump transition committee, on CNN.
"We get a lot of things wrong in the scientific community."
Now at the Co-operative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, Dr Abdalati served as Nasa's chief scientist in 2011, for two years.
He says it is too early to tell if this type of rhetoric from the Trump team will be backed up by action against scientists working on climate issues.
"I do think that when it comes to access to federal databases, and information that the taxpayers have paid for, there would have to be a tremendous paradigm shift to actively take steps to make those data unavailable, and I think doing so would be an enormous disservice to the citizens of this country and to the world in general," he said via email.
"I do think that the scientific community, educators, members of the private sector who rely on these data in their businesses, and others will need to make clear that continued access to these data, which have been paid for by the taxpayers, allows their full value to be realized and is in everyone's best interest."
Other researchers are taking a more pessimistic view on the question of data access and are encouraging colleagues and students to make copies. Prof Robert Paterson, from the University of Texas, Austin, says that he learned this the hard way under the administration of George W Bush, another president cool on climate.
"Within a month of coming into office the EPA website went down for three weeks and when it went back up stuff wasn't available anymore," Prof Paterson told BBC News.
"If history repeats itself with another administration that is basically a naysayer to climate change science, I would say it would be prudent for folks to do what they can to keep as much as they can on mirror sites."
Other scientists are concerned about nominations to key government areas such as former Texas governor Rick Perry at Department of Energy (DoE) and Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt at the EPA. Both have heavily criticised the agencies they now lead.
Attempts by the Trump transition team at the DoE to obtain a list of all those employees who had worked on climate change have provoked anger as well as fear.
"I was horrified by the report with regard to Department of Energy scientists being named.  We must stand up to that and I have said so. We are all DoE scientists in that regard," said Dr Kevin Trenberth who has been a lead author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a senior scientist at the US National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).
"That is a pretty chilling action by an incoming administration - the rhetoric suggests that revenge is a valid response to people who disagree with you," said Prof Robert Paterson,
The Energy department has refused to comply with the request and the Trump team has now said the questionnaire was "not authorised".
Many researchers are worried that the anti-climate tone being struck by the incoming administration will have many serious consequences for scientists trying to do their jobs in real world situations.
"Flooding is a fact of life in Texas and the frequency with which we're seeing it is noticeably increasing," said Dr Shannon Van Zandt, at Texas A&M University.
"A lot of the tools that have been developed by Federal agencies have been designed to help communities predict the changes that they're going to see and if that is restricted we would lose the ability to help people understand and incorporate it into the decisions that they're making both at the local level and at the state policy level."
But some in this field believe that the change of administration is a good moment to review the type of scientific questions that US researchers are asking.
Marcel Crok is a Dutch science writer who doesn't support the scientific consensus on climate change. He says that much of the research in the field takes place in an echo chamber and he welcomes the fact that the Trump administration will challenge this.
Mr Crok accepts that human emissions of carbon dioxide are warming the planet, but he questions the accepted view on how far and how rapidly temperatures will rise. Mainstream scientists, he says, rely on models that are over sensitive to carbon. He expects this to change under Trump.
He said: "What the field is trying to do is prove that the observational estimates are wrong and that the models are still right, and in my opinion this is exactly the problem. They should be more open minded, they should be open to the idea that the models are wrong!"
"I hope that under a Trump regime at least there would be more funding, because if the funding agencies ask these kind of questions they can stimulate research in other directions than proving that the models are right all the time."
The idea that aspects of climate research, supported by a minority, should now gain funding at the expense of the majority view, is dismissed by those in the field.
"It is not all spun, it is not all one side or the other," said Prof James White from the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research at the University of Colorado.
"This is good unbiased information, it would be a real shame if that data is turned off."

Article: The ska group tweeted the news: "It is with deep regret that we say goodbye to our great friend, the world's greatest drummer, our beloved Brad. RIP."
Bradbury joined The Specials in 1979, and continued with the reversioned band The Special AKA, who had a top 10 hit with Free Nelson Mandela.
Bradbury took part in The Specials reunion tour in 2009. He also headed up a band called JB Allstars.
The band's representatives said the drummer died in England but no cause of death was given.
In a statement, his family said: "It is with deepest regret that we have to announce the very sad news that our much loved husband and father John 'Brad' Bradbury passed away on Monday the 28 of December.
"Brad's drumming was the powerhouse behind The Specials and it was seen as a key part to the Two Tone sound. He was much respected in the world of drumming and his style of reggae and ska was seen as genuinely ground-breaking when The Specials first hit the charts in 1979.
"He was an integral part of The Specials reforming in 2008 and toured with them extensively up to the present day. His contribution to the world of music can not be understated and he will much missed by family, friends and fans alike.
"It is the family's sincerest wish that they are allowed the time to remember him privately."
The news comes three months after the band's trombonist, Rico Rodriguez, died.
The band, famed for their 1960s mod-style outfits, had seven UK top 10 singles including Too Much Too Young and Ghost Town.
Founder and songwriter Jerry Dammers dissolved the band in 1981 but they re-grouped and continue to perform and record without their former leading man.
Billy Bragg was one of the first musicans to pay tribute to Bradbury.: "A bad day for good music. First we lose Lemmy, now news that Brad from the Specials has passed away. RIP."
Bradbury was born and brought up in Coventry where the band was formed in 1977.
Music producer Pete Waterman, also from Coventry, expressed his shock at the news of the Bradbury's death.
Speaking to BBC Coventry and Warwickshire, Waterman said: "I always had a good laugh with Brad. He was always proud of being in the band and what we'd and he'd achieved.

Kenya-born Kirwa, who secured Bahrain's first ever Olympic silver and second medal of all time, failed to stay with Sumgong and both women looked physically exhausted after they crossed the line.
"I was never worried that I'd lose this," said Sumgong.
"At 40km I knew the gold was mine. At 35km I noticed that my other two team-mates had dropped off and that gave me the motivation to carry on.
"At 40km I saw there were three of us but I knew whatever happened I couldn't lose the gold and then I knew I was on the way to history."

"The conditions will have taken their toll. The way Sumgong stumbled over the line shows that.
"It was a race of attrition and about who could hold and leave enough. Sumgong dominated that race mentally as well as physically."

"If I push it, I could go backwards or end up back on medication," he said. "There is also a chance of rejection."
The former Manchester United, Newcastle and Blackburn forward suffered kidney failure in 2015 after contracting an airborne virus.
He has just returned to his role as a United ambassador following surgery.
The 45-year-old is not even allowed to fly to Barcelona for a Manchester United legends game on 30 June.
Cole said: "It is a long road ahead. It is a tough road and different to the battles I have had before.
"It is not like getting a football injury, when you go to the gym and work a bit harder."
His 28-year-old nephew Alexander provided the donor kidney - "a noble job" as Cole described it.
Cole has improved physically and has lost most of the weight he gained through his illness.
And while there is still more work to do, Cole, who will be United's assistant manager for the return legends game against Barcelona at Old Trafford on 2 September, is looking forward to playing if a similar match is staged in 2018.
He said: "I still get very tired but I can do a lot more than I was able to two years ago. If this game is played next year I want to be out there."
Earlier this week, another former Newcastle and England striker, Alan Shearer, told the BBC he felt English clubs were a long way off being able to challenge for the Champions League.
Cole agrees, saying: "From what I have seen in Europe, I am not sure any of the English teams will win it. They are miles apart.
"If you look at Real Madrid, Barcelona or Bayern Munich, a lot of the players people are talking about Premier League clubs paying £50m or £60m for can't get in their teams.

Article: Pakistan's telecoms regulator said the ban was no longer necessary because Google, which owns YouTube, had now launched a Pakistan-specific version.
YouTube has denied claims that the authorities can filter content.
Many young Pakistanis have welcomed the lifting of the ban but some activists want details of the deal with Google.
They say there should be greater transparency of the terms agreed between Google and the government.
A Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) official confirmed to the BBC that all internet service providers had been directed to open access to YouTube.
The Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd posted on its Facebook page on Monday: "Welcome Back YouTube".
Pakistan's ministry of information technology said: "Google has provided an online web process through which requests for blocking access of offending material can be made by the PTA to Google directly.
"Google/YouTube will accordingly restrict access to the said offending material for users within Pakistan."
However, a YouTube spokeswoman said government requests for the removal of content would not automatically be granted.
"We have clear community guidelines, and when videos violate those rules, we remove them," she said.
"In addition, where we have launched YouTube locally and we are notified that a video is illegal in that country, we may restrict access to it after a thorough review."
She said requests by governments for content to be removed would be recorded in YouTube's Transparency Report.
Pakistan's ban on YouTube was imposed by the Supreme Court in 2012 after the US-made film Innocence of Muslims was uploaded.
The amateur-made video was condemned in the Muslim world and sparked widespread protests for its mocking portrayal of the Prophet Muhammad.
More than a dozen people died in protests in Pakistan.
Blasphemy is a crime in Pakistan and can carry the death penalty, although such a sentence has not been carried out.

Article: The union is supporting a campaign to stop Bangor University student Shiromini Satkunarajah being deported to Sri Lanka.
The 20-year-old has been taken to a detention centre after being refused asylum.
The Home Office said it considers each case carefully.
Miss Satkunarajah, who was born in Sri Lanka but has lived in the UK for eight years, is due to finish her electrical engineering degree this summer.
She was arrested on Tuesday and taken to a detention centre to await deportation on 28 February.
Thousands of people have signed a petition to stop her deportation.
NUS Wales deputy president Carmen Smith told BBC Wales: "We want the home secretary to stop the callous and inhumane deportation of Shiromini.
"She doesn't have any family or friends in Sri Lanka. Wales is her home.
"She has three months left of her degree. It's a brutal thing to do at such a time in her educational experience."
Arfon MP Hywel Williams said the UK government should use "common sense" in dealing with Miss Satkunarajah's case.
"She has three months to go before she graduates in a field where we really do need people and she's an excellent student," he said.
"There is a certain amount of discretion they can operate and I really wish they would."
A Home Office spokeswoman said: "We do not routinely comment on individual cases.

Article: Details of a major hack emerged last week, but officials have now given details of a potential second breach.
It is feared that the attack could leave US security personnel or their families open to blackmail.
The agency involved, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), is yet to comment on the reports.
Officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to the Associated Press (AP) news agency, believe the attackers have targeted the forms submitted by intelligence and military personnel for security clearances.
The document includes personal information - everything from eye colour, to financial history, to past substance abuse, as well as contact details for the individual's friends and relatives.
A 127-page vetting document called Standard Form 86 may have been accessed. Among the questions potential employees are asked:
A White House statement said investigators had a "high degree of confidence" that background information on government employees had been accessed.
Joel Brenner, a former US counterintelligence official, called the data a "gold mine" for hackers.
It is also believed the breach of personal data of US government workers announced last week may be far larger than previously reported.
Initial estimates put the number of people potentially affected at four million, but officials close to the investigation told AP that as many as 14 million might be involved.
The US has said the hackers, thought to be behind both attacks, are believed to be based in China. Beijing called the claims "irresponsible".
The Obama administration meanwhile announced further measures to beef up cybersecurity on Friday.
"Recent events underscore the need to accelerate the administration's cyber strategy and confront aggressive, persistent malicious actors that continue to target our nation's cyber infrastructure," a White House statement said.

Doull emulated fellow Welshman Geraint Thomas, who won at the 2008 and 2012 Olympics, by helping Great Britain win team pursuit gold in world record time.
The 23-year-old joined record-breaking Sir Bradley Wiggins, Steven Burke and Ed Clancy to beat the world champions.
"That was just surreal, it feels dreamlike" said the Cardiff rider.
Media playback is not supported on this device
"We've been in situations like that before when we've been so close and have lost so to pull it off now is unbelievable."
He had previously won silver medals at the 2015 and 2016 World Championship - this year to the Australian team - but Doull earned Olympic redemption to add to the four Welsh silver medallists in Rio.
"I've dreamt of this moment for so long," added Doull.
"It's what gets you out of the bed in the morning. I've pictured crossing that line first and winning the Olympics and to finally be here and do it, it's just surreal. It's a culmination of four years of hard work."
Swimmer Jazz Carlin, rower Victoria Thornley and rugby sevens players Sam Cross and James Davies had already enjoyed podium finishes before Doull secured Wales' seventh gold in the last three Olympics.
Wales had not won an Olympic title in 36 years when Nicole Cooke stormed to women's road race gold in 2008 - the first Welsh cycling medal ever at an Olympics.
But since Cooke's win in Beijing, Wales have won three more cycling gold medals - and could win a fifth on Saturday when Elinor Barker will help the British world record holding women bid for team pursuit gold.
Doull - who started cycling at the Maindy Fliers club in Cardiff like Thomas and Barker - had helped the Great Britain team to lower the world record in their heat demolition of New Zealand.
But Team GB were quickly behind in Friday's final as Australia led by 0.7 seconds at the halfway mark, before GB reeled them in and then pulled away in the final 500m to win the 4km race by 0.83 seconds - in a world record time of three minutes, 50.265 seconds.
Doull's team-mate Wiggins became the first Briton to win eight Olympic medals - five golds, one silver and two bronzes - as GB won a third successive team pursuit Olympic title.
"It gives you such confidence....you've got Brad on my right behind me and I've got Burke and Ed down below me," said Doull.
"It's Burke's second Olympic title in his discipline, it's Ed's third and he's the most decorated Yorkshireman, so he keeps telling me, so to have that calibre of team is just massive and it gives you such confidence."

Article: The Local Government Information Unit said 94% of the 131 councils it spoke to were intending to put up bills, with their finances at "breaking point".
A third of these, 34% in total, intend to hike bills by more than 2% in April.
Councils, many of whom have frozen bills in recent years, say it will not be enough to plug the funding "gap" exacerbated by the cost of social care.
But the government says council tax is expected to be lower in real terms at the end of this Parliament than it was in 2010.
Although councils in Wales were included in the survey, the Welsh government has said it will not allow councils to raise bills to pay for social care.
Ministers say they are bringing forward money to help councils pay for social care by increasing the "precept" - a supplement that councils are able to charge on bills - from 2% to 5% over the next two years.
Years of cuts to central government funding since 2011 have put pressure on the budgets of the 375 councils in England and Wales, with many paring back core services. Financial pressures on county councils and unitary authorities that provide adult social care have become particularly acute in the past year.
Surrey County Council abandoned controversial plans this week to hold a referendum on a 15% rise in council tax which it said was needed to pay for social care. It will now increase bills by 4.99% - the maximum it can do without holding a public vote.
Labour have accused the government of doing a sweetheart deal with the Tory-controlled council to call off the referendum - claims it denies.
Publishing its research, the Local Government Information Unit said five district councils which do not provide social care had wanted to hold local referendums to sanction council tax rises above 2% but had "thought better" of it in recent weeks.
Inflation, as measured by the CPI index, currently stands at 1.6% but is projected to rise to 2.7% next year.
The LGIU said there was growing concern in town halls that the current system of funding local authorities - through a mixture of government grants, council tax and other income streams such as business rates and parking charges - would become unsustainable in the near future.
Of the 163 council chiefs - across 131 local authorities - which responded to its survey, 42% said future cuts would be "noticed" by residents while one in 10 feared the situation might become so serious that they would no longer be able to fulfil their councils' legal obligations to provide certain services.
A number of county councils - including Newcastle, North Tyneside, South Tyneside and Sunderland - have already said they will add the full 3% "social care precept" to council tax bills next year and many others are expected to follow suit.
Jonathan Carr-West, chief executive of the LGIU, said: "Local government finances are at breaking point."
"We see councils around the country patching their budgets by raising council tax, drawing on their reserves and increasing charging. They have very little confidence in the sustainability of the system.
"Councils are allowed to place a 3% precept on council tax to fund adult social care - nine out of 10 of them saying it is not enough money and won't meet the gap. Councils are going to retain 100% of the new business rates - half of councils tell us they think they will be worse off under that new system post-2020."
He said councils were being frustrated in their efforts to address the problems themselves with revenue-raising measures such as greater scope for charging, local hotel taxes and a re-evaluation of council tax bands "off the government's agenda".
"None of these are wild and wacky ideas. They are things that are done in other countries, in the US, France and Spain and they work.
"Here they are not even part of the conversation. That needs to change."
A spokesman for the Department of Communities and Local Government said: "Council tax is expected to be lower in real terms at the end of this Parliament than it was in 2010 and we've protected residents by allowing them to veto excessive rises at a local referendum.
"Our historic four-year funding settlement gives local authorities the certainty they need to plan ahead, with almost £200bn available to provide the services that local people most value.
"We've also announced an additional £900m for social care, meaning councils will have £7.6bn of dedicated funding to spend over the four years."

Scores of local authorities in England plan to increase council tax by up to 5% in 2017-8, according to research.

Article: Two snowsports enthusiasts got married at a Scottish ski resort before sliding off down a run in their wedding attire.
Bridget and Jonathan Reid, from Moy, near Tomatin in the Highlands, tied the knot at Nevis Range, near Fort William, on Friday.
The couple first's date six years ago was a skiing trip, so they decided it would be appropriate to get married on skis.
Adventure photographer Hamish Frost took their wedding snaps.
Bridget, who is a teacher, and Jonathan, who runs his own electrical automation company, benefited from recent snowfalls for their big day.
They got married in full Highland dress, which includes a kilt, and white wedding dress surrounded by snow-covered mountain landscape.
The white stuff had been lacking over winter, but last month's Storm Doris and recent spells of colder weather have helped with the operation of Nevis Range and Scotland's other outdoor ski centres.
The newly weds said: "Over the last couple of years we have spent as many weekends as possible skiing the Back Corries at Nevis Range.
"We love the atmosphere, the friendliness of the staff and the amazing terrain for skiing.  When we heard that we could actually get married there it was a no-brainer."
The couple got married at the top of Easy Gully in a ceremony officiated by Halde Pottinger from the Humanist Society of Scotland.
"He was totally up for marrying us on skis and did an amazing job. He is currently trying to establish whether or not we are the first wedding actually conducted and vowed in skis - officiate and couple," said the Reids.
"We can't actually believe we are but there can't be many. We also managed to twist the arm of adventure photographer Hamish Frost, who came along to take photographs."
The couple added: "The day could not have been better. Without doubt it was the best conditions of the year - with blue skies and fresh snow, we could not have asked for more."
They thanked the staff of Nevis Range for "a fabulous job making our day possible", and for helping in throwing "a hell of a good party" in the evening.

Article: RIT Capital announced it will not make a formal bid, after confirming reports last week that it was in the early stages of informal talks about merger.
Alliance Trust invests nearly Â£3bn worth of shareholder assets.
It will continue to face a fundamental review of what it does during this summer.
That could still lead to a sale, or outsourcing investment to other asset management firms. And following the review, it is still possible that a deal could be done with RIT.
But the announcement on Tuesday takes Alliance Trust out of the stock market's formal takeover and mergers procedures and oversight by the Takeover Panel.
Activist investors last year forced a change of strategy, aimed at reducing the discount of company value to underlying assets, which involved replacement of board members and chief executive Katherine Garrett-Cox.
A statement from RIT Capital said: "Following careful analysis and constructive discussions with representatives of Alliance Trust, RIT has concluded that it would not be in the best interests of its shareholders to make an offer for Alliance Trust and accordingly announces that it does not intend to make an offer to acquire Alliance Trust.
"The board of RIT respects the process which Alliance Trust are going through and wishes them well with their strategic review."
In response, the Alliance Trust statement said: "The board of Alliance Trust is implementing a series of changes to enhance shareholder value. This process is well under way and has already started to make good progress, lowering costs, narrowing the discount and allowing for the creation of a fully independent board of directors.
"This process of development continues and includes a strategic review of the group, encompassing a broad range of potential courses of action."
Alliance Trust was buying shares on the stock exchange on a daily basis, as part of its strategy to increase shareholder value. Its announcement stated that practice is to be stopped until the review is complete.

Article: The fine follows the conviction of former RBS trader, Shirlina Tsang, for fraud last year.
She was sentenced to 50 months in prison after being caught falsifying records of emerging markets trades.
Hong Kong regulators said RBS's controls were "seriously inadequate".
The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) also said there were "significant weaknesses in its procedures, management systems and internal controls."
But the regulator said the fine took into account the bank's speedy action in alerting the authorities once it had discovered the illegal trades, which took place in its emerging markets rates business in 2011.
"This deserves substantial credit and is the reason why today's sanctions are not heavier ones," Mark Steward, the SFC's head of enforcement, said in a statement.
RBS responded with a statement, reading: "We put in place a comprehensive remediation programme that strengthened our governance and supervisory oversight, and our control environment."
The fine is relatively small compared to others the bank has received in the last few years.
In December RBS agreed to pay 391m euros (£320m) in penalties to the European Commission for its role in the attempted rigging of Yen Libor and Euribor - the Tokyo and euro equivalents of the London interbank offered rate, or Libor.
In the same month it was fined $100m (£60m) by US regulators for violations of US sanctions against Iran, Sudan, Burma, and Cuba.
The bank was found to have removed location information on payments made to US financial institutions from countries such as Iran and Cuba.

Article: Human Rights Watch believes Nato air strikes killed at least 72 civilians and says the organisation needs to bear responsibility where appropriate.
"We're calling for prompt, credible and thorough investigations," HRW's Fred Abrahams told BBC News.
Nato insists it took unprecedented care to minimise civilian casualties.
It argues that it cannot take responsibility because it has had no presence on the ground to confirm the deaths.
Aircraft from the US, the UK and France conducted most of the 9,658 strike sorties last year, targeting forces loyal to Libyan leader Col Muammar Gaddafi.
In March, another human rights organisation,  
          Amnesty International, said it had documented 55 cases
 of named civilians, including 16 children and 14 women, killed in air strikes.
It described Nato's failure to investigate these cases thoroughly as "deeply disappointing".
The point of the Nato air campaign in Libya last year was to protect civilians, so how many innocent people died is still a sensitive issue, BBC diplomatic correspondent Bridget Kendall reports.
In its report published on Monday, HRW said it had examined in detail evidence of claims of civilian deaths from eight separate Nato strikes.
In one instance, it said a first Nato bomb killed 14 people and a second bomb, moments later, killed 18 more who had rushed to help victims.
What concerns Mr Abrahams, the main author of the report, is that the deaths remain unacknowledged and the families have been offered no compensation.
"Until now, Nato has taken a position of denial," he said.
Source: Nato
"They refuse to give information about how they died and they refuse to investigate, and it is this lack of transparency that is deeply troubling.
"I think it will lead to unnecessary civilian deaths in the future if Nato refuses to look at what went wrong and make corrections."
Nato says it is ready to co-operate with the new Libyan authorities in assessing what further action is appropriate.
But so far the task force being set up in Tripoli seems to have made little headway, our diplomatic correspondent adds.

A leading human rights organisation has urged Nato to investigate fully the deaths of civilians in air strikes in Libya last year.

Article: Here are the best bits we heard backstage at the Royal Albert Hall in London.
In La La Land, Emma Stone plays aspiring actress Mia Dolan.
So does the best actress winner think Mia could ever win a Bafta or Oscar?
After a dramatic pause, she delivered her verdict.
"Hopefully!"
"It's been like a whirlwind," said Spider-Man actor Tom Holland, winner of the Rising Star Award. "I'm so happy everything seems to be working out."
The 20-year-old Brit isn't wrong there. Having made his screen debut in tsunami disaster movie The Impossible, he first appeared as Spidey in Captain America: Civil War and recently finished filming for Spider-Man: Homecoming.
But Tom admitted the super hero role has its drawbacks.
"Ever since I was a kid I've wanted to be Spider-Man. It's been so fun, but my legs are in bits right now from spider poses after spider poses.
"So I'll be sitting down for the rest of the evening!"
It was perhaps inevitable that Meryl Streep's speech at the Golden Globes would come up at the Baftas.
Asked about Donald Trump's response, supporting actress winner Viola Davis didn't hold back.
"Anyone who labels Meryl Streep an 'overrated' actress obviously doesn't know anything about acting," she said.
"That's not just directed towards Donald Trump - that's directed towards anyone."
She didn't stop there.
"This is someone who is the master at her skill and she has lasted for 40 years in a very difficult profession," Viola continued.
"One of the things people have to know about this woman is that she is the most honourable, accessible human being you could possibly want to meet."
Best actor winner Casey Affleck said he'd grabbed a word with Meryl Streep after the Baftas ceremony.
"She was taking pictures of people... and I told her how much her speech at the Golden Globes meant to all of us and how grateful I was that she did it and kicked in the door a little bit," he said.
The Manchester by the Sea star said he hoped more actors would speak out.
"There is a big audience for these awards shows... and I have to say I'm very proud to be a part of the arts community.
"I don't always say some of the things I would like to say in those opportunities because there are people like Meryl Streep who say them much better than I can - and if they are going to be said it should be said very, very well because they are important."
"I'm a little bit wobbly," confessed Dev Patel a few minutes after winning the supporting actor prize for Lion.
"I really did not expect it, we have gone to so many awards ceremony and this one is where everything changed, on home turf with my family."
Dev recalled how he had made his acting debut a decade ago on E4's teen drama Skins.
"I remember the first time I ever stepped on a film set, I never knew what a boom mic was," he laughed.
"My mum took me to an open casting of Skins after she saw an advert in Metro newspaper and 10 years on we are here at the Baftas - that is pretty amazing."
Justin Hurwitz, who won the Bafta for his original music in La La Land, said that he'd written a title song that didn't end up in the movie.
"It was going to be in the middle of the movie but we nixed that, and then we toyed with using it in the end credits, and we nixed that at the last minute."
And how about this? Another Day of Sun, from the famous traffic jam scene, was cut "for many months" before being put back in as the big opening number.
Mel Brooks, who was awarded the prestigious Bafta Fellowship, was asked about whether he might write a comedy about Donald Trump.
"I'm not afraid of him, I don't think he's dangerous," said the 90-year-old writer, actor and producer.
"I think he's mostly an entertainer, a guy who wants audiences to love him.
"What I'm afraid of are all the guys around him, the people who whisper in his ears, like the people who whispered in George W Bush's ears and we got the Iraq War...
"I just hope that Trump stays the egomaniac he is, listens to no-one and then we'll all be safe. But if he believes these guys we're all in trouble."
Mel was in a lighter mood as he plugged his new musical Young Frankenstein, which will open in London's West End this year after a run in Newcastle.
"I think, modestly speaking, it will be sensational," he chuckled.

Of his first 30 matches in 2017, the world number one has won 21 and lost nine.
Winning his last five tournaments of 2016 to pip Novak Djokovic to the year-end number one position in the final match of the season at London's O2 Arena was astonishing, dramatic and unforgettable.
And yet it appears that relentless run of success, and the 87 matches he played over a season, has come at a price.
Murray's straight-set defeat by world number 90 Jordan Thompson in the first round at Queen's Club was the sixth time he has lost to a player outside the top 20 this year. He has had shingles and an elbow problem, and now his left hip is proving cause for concern.
Opting out of two scheduled exhibition matches at the Hurlingham Club in London may not be too much of a blow, as Murray's aptitude for grass is likely to allow him some margin for error during the opening week at Wimbledon. But will he be in pain, and will his movement suffer?
Although it was reassuring to see him return to the practice courts on Friday, Murray was walking with a limp and neither moving, nor hitting his backhand, anywhere near as well as he will need to. Only time will tell.

Murray has looked especially vulnerable this season over three sets.
As well as the defeat by Thompson at Queen's, he has also lost in straight sets to Fabio Fognini in Rome (no disgrace), to Borna Coric in Madrid, and to world number 129 Vasek Pospisil at Indian Wells.
Though he was bamboozled by Mischa Zverev in the fourth round of the Australian Open, his Grand Slam record remains formidable. He is aiming this fortnight for a 10th consecutive Wimbledon quarter-final, and the last time he failed to reach the second week of a Slam was when he fell to Stan Wawrinka in the third round of the 2010 US Open.
So, assuming Murray's hip does not leave him underpowered, the French Open provides the best indication as to how he might fare at Wimbledon.
Murray often started slowly in matches at Roland Garros, but put in a dominant third-round performance against Juan Martin del Potro as he won in straight sets. He never looked a realistic champion, but ultimately was just a tie-break away from a second consecutive final. He then ran out of steam, a legacy of insufficient matches, in a Stan Wawrinka-dominated final set of their semi-final.
It would be foolish to try to come to a firm conclusion about Murray's chances at the All England Club this year. Twice a champion, and a gold-medal winner on Centre Court at the 2012 Olympics, not even Novak Djokovic has outperformed him at Wimbledon over the past five years.
Yet on 2017 results alone, Murray is only the seventh best player in the field.
He has too frequently struggled to impose himself on his opponent, and hindered at times by injury, has not been able to trust his serve in the same way.
This year he has won 72% of points on first serve, down from 76% last year; and while last year he saved 66% of the break points he faced, that number has fallen this year to 54%.
He claims his indifferent form is nothing to do with the pressure associated with his status as world number one, and he does not cut the figure of a man weighed down by an unwelcome burden.
But perhaps Murray has lost his cause: he is now the hunted, rather than the hunter.
That may not be a concern much longer.
Murray is virtually 5,000 points behind Rafael Nadal in the season-long race and is therefore very likely to be replaced at the top of the rankings by the autumn at the latest.
In fact, he could be overtaken after Wimbledon by Wawrinka or Djokovic if they win the title, but more probably by Nadal, who assuming both reach the second week would only have to go one round further.
Nadal's knees, Djokovic's blues and Wawrinka's unexceptional Wimbledon record muddy the waters still further.
And then there's Roger Federer: the seven-time champion, who is free of injuries, and last Sunday in Halle won his fourth title of the year having skipped the clay-court season.

Article: The incident began on Tuesday morning when border agents encountered two men carrying backpacks five miles (8km) east of Sumas, Washington, in the US.
Authorities say agents interrupted an attempt to smuggle a load of MDMA, or ecstasy, from Canada to San Francisco.
Two others were arrested and accused of planning to transport the drugs.
On Tuesday morning, US border agents ordered the two men they encountered near the border to halt, officials said.
One of the men dropped his backpack, fired a weapon at the agents, and ran, according to a criminal complaint filed in US federal court in Washington on Wednesday.
The officers took the other man, identified as Jeffrey Laviolette, into custody immediately.
Canadian and US police searched for the fugitive on foot and by helicopter, putting up road blocks.
Nathan Hall, a Canadian citizen, was arrested by the Abbotsford Police Department in British Columbia early on Wednesday morning.
According to border patrol agents, the backpacks Mr Hall and Mr Laviolette were carrying contained a total of 58lb (26kg) of ecstasy.
Also inside one backpack was a California driver's licence with the name of William Nickerson but a picture of Nathan Hall, the complaint alleges.
Investigators later arrested a Bellingham, Washington woman, Kali Henifin, who they say planned to pick the two men up at the border. They also arrested her boyfriend, Ryan Lambert, who allegedly told officers he was to be paid $11,000 (Â£7,270) to drive the drugs to San Francisco.
Ms Henifin told agents they had been monitoring police radio communication on a mobile phone when they heard a report of a shooting and left the area, according to the complaint.
The three defendants in US custody face conspiracy as well as drug possession and distribution charges.
The wooded area a few miles east of a highway border crossing is a well-known smuggling route for drugs and firearms, and a spokeswoman for the US attorney for the Western District of Washington told the BBC smuggling prosecutions are "a large part of our practice".

Article: Witnesses told officers they heard a gun being fired near Anfield Road Primary School at about 09:00 GMT.
Pupils and staff there and at the nearby All Saints Catholic Primary School have been ordered to stay indoors while police investigate.
Ch Supt Mark Harrison said it "beggars belief" it would happen at a school.
Members of the public told police the shot was fired at a dark coloured car by a white man in a grey hooded top who was on foot.
A Merseyside Police spokeswoman said local hospitals had been checked and "no-one has sought medical attention for injuries caused by a firearm".
She said officers were making house-to-house inquiries and studying CCTV footage of the area.
Ch Supt Harrison said the attack "appears to be targeted" and was particularly worrying as "a child could have been seriously injured or worse".
He said police wanted to hear from those inside the car "so we know they are safe".
Anfield Road Primary School's headteacher Clair Drew-Williams said her pupils were "safe and unaware of the incident".
"The site was not evacuated, the school day is continuing as normal and a trip for some pupils took place as planned," she said.

Article: The Fiji international missed Ospreys' 33-27 Champions Cup loss in Bordeaux.
Prop Nicky Smith is also available after injury for a match coach Steve Tandy expects to be one to savour.
"The weather dictates a fair bit, you can't be throwing the ball around if it's greasy, but if there's any casual supporters at that game, it won't lack in intensity and physicality," he said.
Ospreys have been involved a series of entertaining matches in Europe, the latest being their narrow defeat by Bordeaux-Begles, a match that produced eight tries.
That was in stark contrast with the Scarlets' try-less 9-6 loss at home to Glasgow on Saturday.
"Our game in Bordeaux was really pleasing to the eye and a huge physical effort," added Tandy.
"But I'm sure there'll be some physicality and intensity in the game (on Boxing Day) and I'm sure it'll be a spectacle either way."
His side start 14 points behind their west Wales rivals in the Pro12 table, with just four wins compared to the Scarlets' eight after a slow start to the season.
"It would go a long way to closing that gap on them, but we've got three games now in the Pro12 where we need to put in positive performances," said Tandy.
"The Scarlets have had a real good start to their season but we've got a bit of momentum in the way we're doing things at the minute."

Article: An emotional Murray, 29, secured a thrilling 7-5 4-6 6-2 7-5 victory to make it GB's most successful day at an overseas Games with five gold medals.
The see-saw match featured 14 breaks of serve in front of a raucous crowd.
Murray's win comes five weeks after he claimed his second Wimbledon title and four years after London 2012 success.
Both men looked exhausted in the fourth set of a gruelling four-hour contest, with Murray breaking down in tears after finishing off his gritty opponent.
Find out how to get into tennis in our special guide.
The crowd on Centre Court were boisterous throughout, with plenty of Argentine support for 27-year-old Del Potro, although emotions did spill over near the climax when two fans were ejected.
Murray said the final was one of the toughest he had played in and cast doubt on the chances of winning a third gold in Tokyo in 2020.
"Four years is a long time and so many things can change," he said. "Who knows about Tokyo? At 33, I'm not sure I'll be at the same level."
Del Potro's silver medal signifies his continued return to form, with his past three seasons disrupted by a wrist injury.
"Mentally I can only imagine how frustrating that must have been to keep going through the same problem and having to try and come back," said Murray.
"He deserves a lot of credit and he should be very proud."
Del Potro beat world number one Novak Djokovic in the first round despite being stuck in a lift for 40 minutes before the match.
The 2009 US Open champion and London 2012 bronze medallist then defeated 2008 champion Rafael Nadal in an epic three-hour semi-final a day before facing Murray.
"I left the last of my toenails on the court," said Del Potro. "I was tremendously tired. It was the crowd that made me keep running."
He added: "When I look at my medal I'm so happy for that, but I've just lost a great final against Andy and I was close to the gold medal.
"He played better in the important moments and is a great champion."
In Murray, Del Potro came up against a player on a career-defining run in the final.
After inspiring Britain to a first Davis Cup win in 79 years in November, Murray was voted the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year, before reaching the Australian and French Open finals and winning Wimbledon for the second time.
He also became a father earlier this year and led GB out at the opening ceremony of Rio 2016 as his country's flag bearer.
On the court, he has lost just one of his past 30 matches, a run stretching back six months, and has been world number two since November, barring a one-week drop to third in May.
BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller
Murray looked all along as if he would be too good and just too strong, but he had to play a quite brilliant game to prevent the match going to a deciding set.
Some exceptional defence and some awesome returns allowed him to break back for five-all - and two games later he was a double Olympic champion.
He may look back on this achievement as the greatest of his career.
It will mean even more to him that he shared it with Max Whitlock, Justin Rose and Jason Kenny on such a special day for Team GB.
Earlier, Japan's Kei Nishikori claimed his first Olympic medal by beating Spain's 14-time Grand Slam winner Nadal for men's singles bronze.
Nadal, 30, who had already won men's doubles gold, recovered from 5-2 down in the second set to level the match, but lost 6-2 6-7 (1-7) 6-3.
Nishikori, 26, had never been past the quarter-finals at a Games.

Article: Manor's operating company Just Racing Services has been in administration since 6 January, and FRP Advisory has been unable to find a buyer.
Just Racing ceased trading on Friday, effectively ending the Manor team.
The staff were sent home on Friday and told they will be made redundant by the close of business on Tuesday after the payment of January salaries.
FRP said there was "no sustainable operational or financial structure in place to maintain the group as a going concern".
Joint administrator Geoff Rowley added the administration process "provided a moratorium" in the search for a buyer but "no solution could be achieved to allow for the business to continue in its current form".
It is not necessarily the end of Manor - a buyer could potentially still purchase the remnants of the team.
But even if that were to happen, the move makes it much harder for Manor to make it to the start of the season in Australia on 26 March.
The team's collapse leaves 10 teams - 20 cars - on the grid in Melbourne and comes just five days after the sport was taken over by US company Liberty Media and long-time commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone was removed as chief executive.

Manor started life as Virgin Racing in 2010 and has been through several guises in the intervening seven years.
It previously went into administration in October 2014, and was only saved by current owner Stephen Fitzpatrick, the boss of energy firm Ovo, on the eve of the 2015 season.
Fitzpatrick has said the decisive moment was the team's slip to 11th place in the constructors' championship as a result of Sauber's Felipe Nasr finishing ninth in the penultimate race of last season in Brazil. This cost the team in the region of $15m (£12m) in prize money.
Manor were one of three new teams to enter F1 in 2010 after they were promised by then FIA president Max Mosley that a £40m budget cap would be introduced.
But Mosley stood down as head of the governing body in 2009 after losing a fight with the teams over the plan and the cost limit was abandoned.
All three teams have now collapsed.

Anneliese Dodds MEP has called for a European Commission investigation into the FIA and F1 following Manor's collapse.
She said: "The collapse of Manor Racing could be the end of seven turbulent years for a team that brought highly skilled jobs to Oxfordshire. I am very concerned that this follows other job losses in small teams.
"Formula One Group, its owners and the FIA as a regulator really need to be investigated after this collapse.
"The unfair way in which prize money is allocated in the sport, permanently favouring the largest teams regardless of their finishing position, has seen many teams struggle to survive and ultimately reduced the number of cars on the grid.
"The European Commission must investigate the complaints it received last year from two F1 teams related to anti-competitive practices before even more highly skilled jobs are lost both in the South East and all around Europe.
"I will be writing to the Commission to call on them to take serious action on the way F1 is run, before a sport loved by 500 million fans is damaged beyond repair."

Article: The authors, including a team from Edinburgh University, say children born to overweight mothers are at greater risk of health problems in later life.
They say every pregnant woman should have access to dieticians and psychologists to help protect the health of their future children.
During the three-year project several pieces of research were consulted.
In one of the most extensive studies to question whether the health of mothers-to-be can have long-term consequences on their offspring, scientists pulled together several pieces of research across Europe.
One key study, involving 13,000 individuals, revealed that babies born to overweight mothers are more likely to suffer heart disease or strokes or develop type 2 diabetes in later life.
Another analysis from Edinburgh University found that obese women eat a diet richer in saturated fats and poorer in vitamins and minerals during their pregnancy compared to slim women.
In early work, including animal studies, scientists found the placenta of females who ate a high fat diet offered less protection to the foetus from the stress hormone, cortisol.
Offspring were more likely to be small and to suffer mood disorders in later life.
Overall project leader Dr Patricia Iozzo, from the National Research Council, Pisa, Italy, said: "Attention needs to be devoted to the prevention of obesity and becoming overweight among young girls, representing tomorrow's mothers."
Dr Iozzo says the period at the end of pregnancy is particularly important. Her work suggests babies' metabolic health - including the fats and sugars in their blood - may be worse if mothers put on unhealthy amounts of weight at this time.
"I feel the message is a positive one. Mothers can do a lot during pregnancy to look after the future health of their children.
"They must under no circumstances stop eating though. They should ensure they have a balanced diet and make sure they are physically active.
"And I think every mother should have access to a team of health workers during pregnancy - including not just midwives and obstetricians but psychologists and dietitians too."
Louise Silverton, director for midwifery at the Royal College of Midwives, said:"Women should try to be an ideal weight before they become pregnant and, if not, should follow midwifery advice to manage their weight while eating a good diet rich in micronutrients.
"After birth, women need support to develop healthy patterns of eating and exercise.
"For women who are overweight or obese they need support to access weight-loss services to ensure that they are an ideal weight before they embark on their next pregnancy.

Article: We received that question from Drew who is planning a trip to New York in December. He asked: "Should I get my cash now or should I wait? Will there be much change between now and then?"
Anthony Reuben, from BBC Reality Check, had this answer: "The BBC does not give financial advice, but here are a few things to bear in mind...
"The exchange rate between the pound and the dollar reflects the views of investors about the relative strengths of the two economies.
"Since the Brexit vote in June the pound has fallen about 18% against the dollar on the judgment that growth is likely to be stronger in the US than the UK and that UK interest rates are falling while the next movement in US rates is expected to be upwards.
"But it's always possible that something could happen to change that view - there is a presidential election in the US in November, for example. The outcome of that could make a considerable difference to the exchange rate.
"You do not necessarily have to put all your eggs in one basket - there is also the option to hedge your bets and buy half of your dollars now and half of them just before you go, as long as you are not going to be hit by extra charges for carrying out two transactions.
"It is always worth shopping around when buying currency - avoid buying your currency at the last minute at the airport. There are plenty of comparison sites online that will help you get the most dollars possible for your pounds, even if it is fewer than you would have got a few months ago."
We asked readers to send in questions about the recent fall of the pound and rise of the FTSE 100.

Article: The blast in a town in Puebla state was apparently caused by thieves attempting to steal fuel from the pipeline.
Oil gushed through the streets and caught fire, destroying homes and cars and forcing hundreds of people to flee.
Mexican President Felipe Calderon has visited the scene and promised to launch an investigation.
Puebla State Secretary Valentin Meneses said the explosion injured 52 people as well as destroying 32 houses and damaging scores more in San Martin Texmelucan - a small community about 80km (50 miles) east of Mexico City.
He said that according to early indications, a criminal gang had punctured the pipeline.
"They lost control because of the high pressure with which the fuel exits the pipeline. The streets began to flood, then came a spark and we saw rivers of fire in the streets," he said.
In pictures: Mexico pipeline blast
One local resident said she awoke at about 0530 local time to a strange, overpowering smell, like petrol.
Minutes later, her street looked as if it was flowing in tar, and then it erupted in flames. Her husband knocked down a wall, allowing them to escape from the back of their home.
"It was like we were living in an inferno. Everything was covered in smoke," she said, quoted by AP news agency.
The fire was brought under control by midday, and the state oil monopoly Pemex said it had shut the pipeline down.
President Calderon arrived in the town later on Sunday to survey the damage and visit the injured.
He offered his condolences to the victims' families and said those responsible for the incident would be brought to justice.
Pemex says that theft of oil from its pipelines is a chronic problem, costing it hundreds of millions of dollars a year.

Article: More than 300 people entered Alternative Model of the Year with the winner being decided by judges in Newcastle on Saturday.
Vintage-fan Zoe Waters, 19, from Bishop Auckland, is a student at Newcastle University.
Ms Waters said she was shocked to be declared the winner. "I've always dressed a bit crazy," she said.
"I don't know why I wanted to be different, I guess I just always choose to wear what I like and look how I want to look rather than worrying about what's in fashion."
She said she now plans to pursue a career in modelling.
"I'm only 5ft 3in tall and I never wanted to look normal so I never thought I could actually be a model, I hadn't realised how big the alternative modelling world is."
Organiser Kieran Martin said: "There is a lot of prejudice and hatred for people from sub-cultures so we wanted to create something that would celebrate the different lives we have, we are proud of what we are achieving."
The final was held at Northumbria University in Newcastle.

Article: It follows suggestions third-party software had been used to steal intimate photos of celebrities - posted online last month - from iCloud.
The action should stop the tool from being able to infiltrate Apple's internet storage service if the safety measure is implemented.
However, the security facility remains an opt-in choice.
One expert suggested that Apple should instead make it the default option.
The process works by introducing an extra step after an account holder has typed their username and password into a device they have not used before.
They are also required to enter a four-digit code that is either texted to a trusted mobile phone number or sent via Apple's Find My iPhone app.
If the person does not enter the code, they are refused access to iCloud and are blocked from making an iTunes, iBooks, or App Store purchase.
They can, however, use a 14-character recovery key to regain access to the account in the event their trusted device is lost or stolen. They are told to keep this in a safe place to avoid being locked out.
While Apple had offered the two-step verification system in the past, until now it had not come into play when device owners used the firm's back-up service.
That meant that even if people had switched on the two-step feature to prevent cyber-thieves logging into their accounts with a stolen or guessed password, the attackers could still download a complete back-up of their data by using Elcomsoft's Phone Password Breaker.
Several hackers' forums contain discussions about using of pirated copies of Elcomsoft's "forensic" software, which is marketed as a tool for law enforcement agencies to access iCloud content without needing to be in possession of a suspect's iPhone or iPad.
ElmcomSoft's Moscow-based owner told the BBC earlier this month that he believed his software had been used in the recent hacks, as it was "the only one able to do that".
He has now acknowledged that Apple's changes guard against the technique he had used.
"I think that implementation is secure, and so there is no workaround," Vladimir Katalov told the BBC, adding that his program could no longer even get a list of devices and back-ups linked to a user's account.
"The other security improvement, which I like, is that now the owner of the Apple account gets a notification by email immediately when a back-up starts downloading - whether or not two-factor authentication is enabled."
However, he added that he still had concerns about Apple's security system.
"The recovery key is hard to remember. And as far as you are not going to use it frequently - it is not needed at all while you have the trusted device handy - there is a good chance that you lose it," he said.
"And if you lose your device too, there will be no way to get your data back.
"Secondly, the recovery key might be stolen. And someone who managed to get your Apple ID password and your security key could make a lot of trouble for you, not just downloading your selfies."
But another security expert downplayed the risk of lost recovery keys, and said that Apple should do more than just recommend people switch on the two-factor test.
"We've seen so much in recent times that single-step verification - ie passwords - is vulnerable, we're at the stage that two-factor authentication should be the default," said Prof Alan Woodward, from the University of Surrey.
"It's a case of turn it on by default, and let people turn it off if they really don't want it.
"And that applies to not just Apple, but companies like Microsoft and Google too."
Apple has told the Wall Street Journal that it "plans to more aggressively encourage people" to turn two-factor authentication on and use stronger passwords.
"When I step back from this terrible scenario that happened and say what more could we have done, I think about the awareness piece," chief executive Tim Cook told the newspaper.
"I think we have a responsibility to ratchet that up. That's not really an engineering thing."

Apple has expanded its use of "two-step verification" checks to protect data stored online by its customers.

Article: The Yomper statue is currently located in front of the Royal Marines Museum at Eastney.
The National Museum of the Royal Navy has started consulting over a proposed move to Portsmouth Historic Dockyard.
Campaigners insist it is a local memorial to the conflict and "belongs" at Eastney.
The Yomper statue was created by Philip Jackson, depicting a royal marine marching across the islands during the 1982 conflict and was unveiled by former prime minister, Lady Thatcher, in 1992.
The National Museum of the Royal Navy (NMRN) is planning to relocate the Royal Marines Museum from Eastney to Portsmouth Historic Dockyard as part of a Â£13m lottery funded project and wants to take the statue with it.
An online petition against moving the statue has attracted more than 1,800 signatories, saying it was "now considered as our local Falklands War Memorial".
Sheila Mackie who set it up said: "The imposing scale of The Yomper needs space and adequate distance to be fully appreciated, and the visualization of the part in the major campaign that the statue represents couldn't be achieved in an interior space."
Conservative-led Portsmouth City Council also voted to express a "clear preference" that the statue remain where it it is.
Its motion stated: "The Yomper statue has graced the seafront for many years, serving as a reminder of both the Falklands War and of the Marines' historical association with Eastney."
NMRN director Jon Rawlinson said the new museum site would potentially have 750,000 visitors a year, compared to 40,000 at the current museum.
"He would be seen by far more people at the historic dockyard, but of course he was built for here [Eastney] and is part of here. "
He said no decision had been made and it would consider all comments submitted to its public consultation.

Article: The fact that languages are no longer compulsory at GCSE has led to the problem, says the university's head of modern languages Dr David Barr.
Around 800 global firms have bases in Belfast, employing about 75,000 people.
But Dr Barr says there's now a shortage of supply to meet the demand.
"Lots of companies and employers are seeing opportunities for local graduates staying in Northern Ireland," he says.
"What we are fighting against is the trend nationally for graduates to think there are no jobs in Northern Ireland and then they leave us en masse."
Micro Focus Belfast employs 130 people who sell software and provide customer care  across Europe, North and South America, the Middle East and Africa.
Mary McDermott, who is responsible for company recruitment, says: "We don't get a lot of local graduates applying for jobs.
"We could fill an English role here quite easily with 30 plus applicants.  If we're looking for French, Spanish or German speakers that candidate pool is a lot lower.  Fewer candidates are applying.  But we find we have some really good success stories of local graduates who speak French and Spanish and who have been very successful in those language specific roles."
Louise Kearney has been working at Micro Focus for six months.  She speaks Spanish, French and Chinese.
"When I was at school at St Louise's in Belfast it was compulsory to take a language at GCSE.  I was very arty at that age and had it not been for languages being compulsory it could have been a completely different story for me today.  I'm very glad I had to study languages"
There are fears too that changes to the curriculum at GCSE and A level could further impact the uptake in languages.
Alexandra Bell, head of modern languages at Lagan College in Belfast, says she has concerns that possible changes to GCSE and A-levels could put the study of languages "back 20 years".
Teachers in Northern Ireland are currently being consulted about changes, she says.
"Employers want students who can speak, communicate and sell their products," she says.
"There's a concern amongst teachers that some exam boards are looking at maybe including a little too much literature.
"Students should have a choice and that includes a business and careers bent in their studies.
"Not that there isn't a place for literature at A-level. But give employers what they need. Someone who wants to use their languages in engineering isn't really going to need to know about Camus [Albert Camus, author of The Outsider]."

Article: It is believed to be the first alleged breach of the Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures (TPim).
The suspect appeared at the Old Bailey accused of failing to contact a monitoring company and report to a police station twice in January.
The Home Office has refused to comment on the case.
TPims replaced control orders in January 2012.
The suspect - who can only be referred to as BM - was one of nine British citizens subject to a TPim when the figures were last disclosed in March.
The BBC is not aware of anyone else who has appeared in court charged with a breach of a TPim.
The Home Office said: "We do not comment on individual cases.  The police investigate all breaches of TPims and will prosecute where that is viable."
Those subject to a TPim can be ordered to stay overnight at a specified address and report to a police station every day.
Other measures include a ban on contacting particular individuals, going to certain areas and places and travelling abroad.
Labour has argued that TPims have "weakened" public protection against terrorism.
In March, the independent reviewer of terror laws, David Anderson, said TPims could prove less effective than control orders because they can be imposed for a maximum period of two years only.
The court heard that BM is charged with two counts of breaching Section 23 of a TPim order.
The allegations are that on 16 January he failed to contact a monitoring company, and on 27 January failed to report to a police station.
BM, who has a grey beard and was dressed for the hearing in a white shirt, cannot be named nor have his address published for legal reasons.
The prosecutor Louise Gray asked for a provisional date of 2 July to be set for a plea and case management hearing.
The defendant was granted unconditional bail although he remains subject to the restrictions imposed by his TPim.
A trial date was not set.

Article: Labour MP Mrs Cox died when she was shot and stabbed in Birstall, West Yorkshire, on Thursday.
After her death, her friends set up a fundraising page, with proceeds to be divided between causes she had supported.
In a tweet, her husband Brendan said the money would "change lives".
The fund was pushed past the seven-figure mark shortly before 20:30 BST on Monday by a single £6,000 donation. More than 30,000 people have donated so far.
Money raised will support three charities Mr Cox said were close to his wife's heart - the Royal Voluntary Service, Hope not Hate and the White Helmets.
Mrs Cox's friend Tim Dixon, one of those who launched the fund, said: "The scale and speed of the public response to this fund has been overwhelming and deeply gratifying to Jo's family.
"It shows how powerfully Jo's story has moved so many. Jo would be so proud."
Gofundme, which hosts the appeal, said it was the largest UK campaign it had seen, and the third largest globally.
The fundraising milestone came after MPs gathered in the House of Commons on Monday to pay tribute to Mrs Cox as members of her family looked on.
Friends of Mrs Cox have announced plans for a public event in Trafalgar Square in London on Wednesday, on what would have been her 42nd birthday.
Mr Dixon said her husband Brendan was doing "an amazing job, and we're telling him that".
He said: "Over the weekend, he was thinking about how having kids just three and five years old, they're not going to have many memories of their mother when they grow up - he wants to capture those memories now.
"He had them write down special memories of mummy on pieces of paper, cut them out and hang them on the tree in his parents' garden."
The Batley and Spen MP died after she was attacked outside a library on her way to a constituency surgery.
Bernard Kenny, 77, was discharged from hospital on Monday night after he was stabbed in the stomach as he went to the aid of Mrs Cox.
A petition to the Cabinet Office calling for Mr Kenny to be awarded the George Cross has gained over 27,000 backers.
Rachel Collinson, who started the petition and is a Green Party spokesperson, said the move would "draw the nation together to celebrate rather than to give in to fear".
She said: "This man is a ray of light in a dark time, in a moment where the UK seems to be troubled by fear and division. This guy can be a beacon for all of us in what he did."
A Cabinet Office spokesman said: "The government is of course aware of the calls for Bernard Kenny to receive an honour and we will examine the evidence, which will then be considered by the honours committee to decide whether to recommend him for an honour."
Thomas Mair, 52, from Birstall, faces charges of murder, grievous bodily harm, possession of a firearm with intent to commit an indictable offence and possession of an offensive weapon in connection with the attack on Mrs Cox.

Article: Alan Solomons' side had scored a wonderful try through centre Will Helu after Munster had started strongly with a John Ryan score.
Sam Hidalgo-Clyne kicked three penalties with a host of returning World Cup internationals on both teams.
But the scrum-half saw his dramatic drop-goal attempt charged down three minutes into overtime.
With just three minutes gone, Ryan muscled between Edinburgh's centres to ground the ball against the base of the post, Keatley converting.
Hidalgo-Clyne replied with a penalty and Munster's Gerhard van den Heever was sin-binned for colliding with the airborne Tom Brown, but Edinburgh - supreme in the scrummage and wayward come the lineout - failed to capitalise significantly on the winger's absence.
Keith Earls came within a whisker of a second try, haring after a sumptuous Conor Murray box kick deep into the Edinburgh 22, but spilling the bouncing ball at the corner flag as the cover defence heaved him out of play.
Keatley thumped over a penalty from just inside Edinburgh's half after the home pack shunted a fraction too early in the scrum and Hidalgo-Clyne slotted his second three-pointer to bring the hosts back within four points at the break.
Under Solomons, Edinburgh have relied more upon a pulverising pack than abandon out wide, but the try they crafted shortly after half-time was a work of some beauty.
It started with Cornell du Preez, the back-row, fielding a kick in his own half and releasing Damien Hoyland down the wing with a delightful offload.
Youngster Hoyland danced and shimmied his way through the Munster defenders, before the ball was swept to the other flank via Hamish Watson and Tom Brown to find Helu, who raced for the corner and grounded powerfully.
Hidalgo-Clyne's conversion attempt ricocheted back off the upright.
Keatley then hooked a penalty effort wide from distance and Munster lost a second man to the flash of David Wilkinson's yellow card, All Black centre Francis Saili binned as he was caught on the wrong side of a ruck.
Hidalgo-Clyne converted the resulting penalty, but Munster's pivot cancelled it out with one of his own five minutes later.
There is little doubt Edinburgh are on an upward trajectory, but there are still rough edges, notably in the fluidity of the backline play, to be refined - the number of infuriating fumbled passes will have more than irked Solomons.
From one such vexing spill, replacement prop John Andress brought a scrum crashing to ground and Keatley regained Munster's lead with a huge kick from the tee.
The visitors turned the screw. Keatley arrowed the ball in behind Brown and the Irish pack lay siege to Edinburgh's line, yielding a yellow card for the hosts' fly-half Greig Tonks.
Edinburgh rallied well, though, resisting Munster's advances, and with the clock almost red, Hoyland intercepted in his own 22 to race downfield and set up a heart-stopping, but ultimately fruitless, finale.
Edinburgh: Blair Kinghorn, Damien Hoyland, Will Helu, Matt Scott, Tom Brown, Greig Tonks, Sam Hidalgo-Clyne; Alasdair Dickinson, Ross Ford, WP Nel, Anton Bresler, Alex Toolis, Mike Coman (captain),  Hamish Watson, Cornell Du Preez.

Canada and particularly Ontario has been promoting its car-making sector as it attempts to compete with Mexico.
Ontario's Premier called the investment a "vote of confidence".
"Our government welcomes this investment, which will help Ontario play a leading role in building the auto industry of the future," said Premier Kathleen Wynne.
Canada has been fighting to keep carmakers in the country. Many have been lured to Mexico where production is cheaper and the cars have the same tariff free access to the US market.
As part of this effort last year Ontario became the first Canadian province to allow road testing of driverless cars.
Over the last five years carmakers in Ontario produced nearly 15% of all North American vehicles.
The investment will be in GM's Kapuskasing plant, which focuses on cold weather technology.

Article: But the latest Cinderella is bucking the trend - and seemingly appealing to audiences as a result.
Directed by Sir Kenneth Branagh, Cinderella is a live-action version of Disney's classic 1950 animation that has taken $70m (Â£43.1m) on its opening weekend in the United States.
Yet this adaptation is completely faithful to the traditional story - including wicked stepmother, fairy godmother, glass slipper, handsome prince and happy ending.
British actress Lily James, best known as Lady Rose from ITV's Downton Abbey, stars as Cinderella. Cate Blanchett plays the stepmother and Helena Bonham Carter is the fairy godmother.
"Keeping it classic is the twist," says Branagh, who started his directing career in 1989 with his adaptation of Shakespeare's Henry V.
"I always felt that it's better to do a modern version of a story using the historical perspective, than say, make a story of Cinderella in Brooklyn in 2015.
"I find that when you try and update Shakespeare to a contemporary setting too, you always pay a price.
"In this case, the original material of Cinderella is far richer than my ideas, so it seems to me that it's my job to make it simple. Just let the fairytale speak, because it affects us in a more complicated way than we think.
"Audiences have already come up to me saying the film is about patchwork families, about child bereavement, about the politics between women these days. Fairytales are a psychological brain-worm that need to be left alone to do their work."
Helena Bonham Carter says that at first she was dubious "as to whether a straight version would work".
"I think it's a really good film, but it could so easily have been bad. I was saying: 'So you're really going to do a completely straight version of Cinderella? No gimmicks, no extra frills, no 3D?'
"It's very classic, but they know me, and they allowed me not to be that straight in my own role."
Just as audiences seem to have taken to the film, critics such as the Guardian's Guy Lodge comment that "while it might have been nice to see the new-model Cinderella follow Frozen's progressive, quasi-feminist lead, the film's naff, preserved-in-amber romanticism is its very charm".
But James disagrees that this Cinderella is an old-fashioned heroine, pointing out that at the start of Disney's 1950 classic, Cinderella "is staring out of the window dreaming of the prince and waiting for him to rescue her".
"This Cinderella doesn't do that at all. I think we make it very clear that everything she does is her choice - even deciding to stay on at her parents' house with such wicked treatment from her stepmother.
"She is told by her dying mother to 'have courage and be kind' and this is the film's, and Cinderella's, backbone."
This is the first major leading role for Surrey-born James. "Not even a big TV series like Downton could prepare me for this fuss," she says.
"I am getting slightly carried away. I keep seeing giant posters of me all over the place in a big blue dress and people shouting my name.
"I'm trying to enjoy the magic actually - this is the fairytale aspect of it for me, personally. It's quite something that so many little girls are going to think I'm Cinderella."
James has dismissed speculation that her waist had been digitally altered to make it smaller as "irrelevant", claiming that fans were interested in Cinderella because of her "morals".
Cate Blanchett agrees that the core of the film is "kindness", adding that it is "an unusual quality these days. There's not a cynical bone in this film's body and that's its strength.
"There is cruelty and jealousy in the movie too, but too often we don't value kindness. In today's world you think someone who is kind is a doormat, and the fact this triumphs is really heart-warming."
Branagh, who previously directed Marvel's Thor, describes kindness "as its own super-power. It is a dark world and children do need to understand they need courage and resilience to get through it.
"People often compare the story of Shakespeare's King Lear in relation to Cinderella. There is a resemblance there - a father making a tragic error and three daughters; great cruelty and great kindness.
"This film is all about the difficult but simple choice to be good and kind. Whether you're dealing with Shakespeare or the great fairy stories, they are all great big metaphors for human nature.
"And regardless of what happens to this film version, I believe this is why the tale of Cinderella will keep enduring."
Cinderella is out in the UK on 27 March.

Article: But one nation, Russia, was missing.
For the first time in Eurovision history, the host nation barred another country's singer.
That is because in 2015, in violation of Ukrainian border rules, Russia's Julia Samoilova performed in Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula annexed by Russia a year earlier.
Samoilova suffers from a neural muscular disorder and has used a wheelchair since childhood.
"When the rumours began I might not go, I was so sad," she told the BBC in Moscow. "I thought, how come? This was my dream. When the final decision was taken I didn't believe it. But unfortunately, this is the reality."
"I think it's a stupid reaction," Russian MP Vitaly Milonov tells me. "They're even afraid of such a small girl to enter Kiev."
Even before Ukraine's ban, Mr Milonov had called for a Russian boycott of Eurovision: "Eurovision became a disgusting socialist nightmare for all these left-wing parties with all their bearded women, or men, with these anti-Christian positions.
"I am sure that most conservatives in the world will never attend this festival. Because this is a festival of Sodom and Gomorrah."
It is supposed to be a festival of peace and friendship but there is not much sign of either in relations between Kiev and Moscow.
In eastern Ukraine, 10,000 people have been killed in three years of war: a war in which Russia is directly involved through its military support for separatist rebels. Crimea remains a source of tension and Eurovision is the latest battleground.
"Since 2014, we've had a law in Ukraine that punishes people who illegally cross our border when they visit Crimea," says Ukrainian MP Olha Chervakova.
"Did Russia know this? Of course. Did Russia know that Julia Samoilova would fall foul of this law? Of course. In other words, entering her in the contest was a conscious provocation to create a huge political scandal."
The ban created a huge headache for Eurovision organisers, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).
Eurovision's Executive Supervisor Jon Ola Sand said in March that Ukraine's decision went "against both the spirit of the contest and the notion of inclusivity that lies at the heart of its values".
In an unprecedented move, the EBU offered Russia the chance to take part by satellite from Moscow.
Russia declined: after the dramas of last year's Eurovision, Moscow was in no mood to compromise.
Ukraine's 2016 winning entry, 1944, sung by Jamala, was about Joseph Stalin's deportation of Crimea's Tatar population.
Russia had argued that Jamala's song broke contest rules for being of a political nature. When it won, Moscow cried foul and said there was politics at play. Now Russia seems determined to make not only Ukraine look bad, but the entire Eurovision Song Contest.
When strangers are coming, they come to your house, they kill you and say 'we're not guilty'
Recently, two Russian pranksters - posing as Ukraine's prime minister and his assistant - released online a telephone conversation they had recorded with a woman they claimed was EBU Director General Ingrid Deltenre.
If this is the voice of the EBU's top official, it is hugely embarrassing for the EBU, because the woman on the recording makes an astonishing admission about Ukraine's winning song: "I was just too late made aware of the song.
"If I would have been earlier, and I think it was on purpose, I would have not allowed the song to participate, to be very transparent."
In a statement, the EBU said it would "not comment on prank calls".
But these are high-profile Russian pranksters, who once fooled Elton John into thinking he was talking to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
"Now our people don't trust Eurovision any more," one of the pranksters, Alexei, told me. "People understand that any country can use their political goals to win, so it's not a fair contest anymore."
Perhaps this is not just about a song contest? Or Russia's relations with Ukraine?
Equating Eurovision with Sodom and Gomorrah and embarrassing the EBU appear part of a wider pattern of Russia trying to undermine Western institutions and Western liberal ideas.
"Russia now defines itself in its social and societal model against the West," believes Jan Techau of the Richard Holbrooke Forum at the American Academy in Berlin. "The Kremlin explicitly portrays Russian society as a counter model to the corrupted West. They seem now to buy completely into the idea that whatever harms the West is good for Russia: a classic zero-sum game."
In the run-up to this year's contest, singer Jamala warned that "we should expect more provocations [from Russia] because our victory hurt them a lot."
Security in Kiev is tight ahead of the first semi-final.
As for Julia Samoilova, instead of singing at Eurovision this week, she will be performing - once again - in Crimea. Another political message from Moscow, to Kiev and to Europe.

Article: Alex McKechnie, then 16, was in the crowd for that first show and went on to be a regular at the club:
"I saw The Beatles a few times in the north end of Liverpool and was working in Liverpool city centre as a messenger boy in a printing works when I heard that they were on at the Cavern in a lunchtime session.
"The Cavern was in the basement of a three or four storey warehouse. The public went down one flight of stone stairs and then there were three long arches.
"At the end of one of the long arches was a little tiny stage. That's where the Beatles performed 292 times.
"I remember it being very highly charged with excitement. The music sounded even more exciting [than the previous gigs] because The Cavern was this little squashed space so the music sounded a bit louder, a bit more exciting and a bit more vital. About 20 to 30 people were there.
"The Beatles were the complete package - they didn't just have a great singer, they had two great singers. They always did harmonies right from the very first time I saw them.
"They could probably only afford two microphones, and so when one was doing the lead singing the other two were facing each other on the mic, and it was quite charismatic, it was nice to look at. They had a camaraderie about them.
"I never heard them singing one of their own songs because they were just a straight covers band at that time, as was everybody else in Liverpool.
"The standard songs that they sang - them and the other bands in Liverpool - were [by] Chuck Berry, Little Richard, the Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly. The sound that I very clearly remember the Beatles playing in the Cavern was a Chuck Berry riff.
"As well as doing the stock standards, the Beatles were a bit different because they were better at playing complicated chords. The Beatles were a bit more adventurous.
"It wasn't just the music and the singing, it was their lack of respect for the audience. At the Cavern for those first few gigs, they were quite irreverent to the audience and other people. They were sort of the first punk band. The Beatles were a law unto themselves on the stage.
"They were still doing that when they went to America - if someone asked them a question they didn't give a serious answer, and that's how they behaved on stage in the Cavern, and that's why I think they liked it in the Cavern.
"They were the epitome of rebellion in Liverpool because they weren't trying to imitate Cliff Richard and the Shadows doing little in time steps. They would dance out of step on purpose.
"That was their purpose in life - to upset the apple cart. They were so cheeky and so entertaining all around. They were a little bit of a voice for us against authority. I think they were rebels. We were mini rebels supporting them.
"Of course when I went back to work I used to stand gazing out of the window thinking about the Beatles and the girls at the Cavern. I couldn't really concentrate on doing any work.
"Just in a few weeks they'd gained a bigger following. When word went around, the crowd grew and people kept coming back. Once you'd seen them, not many people didn't go to see them again.
"They had big long queues, right down the length of the street and even round the corner at the bottom. But at that stage I'd dumped them.
"They started talking about going to London and making records and things like that. Betrayal.
"I wasn't the only one. I think the ones who thought that they'd discovered them were a little clique and really did give up on them when the masses found them. It was only when I heard Love Me Do on the radio that I started getting interested in them again. My wife subsequently bought all the LPs but that first era of The Beatles was over for me."
Alex McKechnie was speaking to BBC News entertainment reporter Ian Youngs.
The Cavern is celebrating the anniversary with a series of tribute events on Wednesday. A documentary about the first gig will be broadcast on ITV1 at 2240 GMT on Wednesday.

Article: The fact that the government is no longer even the biggest shareholder marks an important return to near normality.
Since 2013, the government stake has been sold off at first in a couple of big chunks and then in a gradual trickle and so this moment was bound to happen at some stage.
The government still owns nearly 6%, but global investor Blackrock now eclipses that and Lloyds is on trajectory to return to full private ownership later this year when taxpayers should recoup all the money they put in.
It hasn't been an easy ride.  The huge compensation costs of PPI mis-selling and intermittent market turbulence have hampered and delayed the process, but Lloyds, while not risk-free, can be considered pretty much out of the woods.
As a plain vanilla UK savings and lending bank, Lloyds was always going to be an easier bank to fix than RBS which is still about 71% owned by the taxpayer.
As a global bank with fingers in most of the pies that got burnt during the crisis, RBS has paid out over Â£50bn in fines and compensation and has its biggest reckoning yet to come.
It is still facing a bill from US authorities which could end up in the double digit billions for its role in the subprime mis-selling scandal that started the whole financial crisis in the first place.
While those negotiations could come to a head as early as this week (watch out for separate blog on this), RBS won't reach the point Lloyds did today for many, many years to come.

Eight years ago the government rescued Lloyds by taking a 43% stake for just over Â£20bn.

Article: About 47% of working South Africans earn less than the wage, which is being introduced to combat income poverty and inequality.
But critics say it could put more people out of work as employers might not be able to afford the higher wages.
The government says it will consult on the issue, but hopes to introduce a minimum wage within two years.
Announcing the rate, which was proposed by a panel of advisers, the country's deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa said: "We are now a step closer to finalising discussions on the national minimum wage. All social partners will now decide what their take is."
He said the panel was not endorsing the proposed figure as a living wage, but wanted to set a minimum payment for workers.
Wages are politically sensitive in the country, where the official unemployment rate is close to 25%.
One employment expert reckoned the figure was only about a quarter of the amount needed for the upkeep of a typical South African working-class household.
Prof Chris Malikane of the University of Witwatersrand told a Johannesburg radio station: "You would need 12,000 rand to sustain a basic household."
The African National Congress, South Africa's ruling party, supported the proposal calling it "credible and clearly supported by clear evidence".
However, the Economic Freedom Fighters, the country's third largest political party, said the plan "favours business at the expense of workers".
It called for a higher minimum wage of at least 4,500 rand.
South Africa faces a possible downgrade to sub-investment grade by credit ratings agencies next month, with concerns remaining over violent wage strikes.
Moody's currently rates South Africa two notches above subinvestment grade, with a negative outlook, while Fitch and S&P Global Ratings have it just a step above "junk".
However, Mr Ramaphosa said: "We have made tremendous progress on the labour instability issues,"

Article: Daniel Braxton was driving through Towyn, Conwy county, with his 18-year-old daughter at 07:15 BST on Tuesday.
She thought she saw a dead baby in the bus stop near the Magpie and Stump pub and screamed at her father to drive back to check, which he did.
Mr Braxton, 35, said he saw the lifeless naked baby on the ground, with her umbilical cord still attached.
"We blocked the road off and rang the emergency services," he told BBC Radio Wales.
"I had a dressing gown in the car and ran to grab that, wrapped the baby up, gave her some good hard rubs on the chest and the head.
"She took one big gulp of breath and opened her beautiful little eyes."
Mr Braxton, who is originally from Birmingham and living in nearby Pensarn, said they guessed that the baby was less than one hour old.
"To be honest, I think the fatherly instinct and the adrenaline kicked in because my daughter was hysterical and my partner was hysterical," he added.
"So it was just a case of as soon as I saw her lying there, her naked little body just left on cold concrete, I knew something had to be done."
Mr Braxton said police have told him that the baby has "stabilised and is on her way to a full recovery".
Police are concerned about the welfare of the baby's mother and have urged her to come forward.
Helen Douglas, of North Wales Police, said: "We are concerned about the health of the mother of the baby girl and are appealing for her to come forward.
"Alternatively, if anyone knows who the mother is or can provide any information which may assist in identifying her please contact North Wales Police.
"We want to ensure that the mother is provided with the medical support she needs."

Article: Concern is mounting about the potential of a vicious power struggle in Addis Ababa, triggering a negative chain reaction across the region.
For many of Ethiopia's Horn allies, the death has come at an awkward moment, not least because a delicate political transition in Somalia is incomplete and under serious strain, and a stand-off between South Sudan and Sudan risks dragging the region into a new armed conflagration.
Mr Meles was a complex figure, hard to pigeon-hole, much less force into a one-dimensional portrait frame.
A mystique has over the years grown around his personality and politics, making the task to objectively assess his legacy difficult and highly fraught.
To use a Churchillian phrase, the man was a riddle and a mystery inside an enigma, and by extension so too the secretive state he presided over.
But he was the one African leader who was impossible to ignore.
The diminutive ex-guerilla leader was a towering figure whose austere, unsmiling and understated public persona often belied his great influence and charisma.
Since 1991 he has been the undisputed and pre-eminent key player in the Horn - a formidable strategist whose role remained indispensable in the regional efforts to resolve deadly conflicts and contain militant Islamism.
Domestically, his legacy is contested. To his ardent fans, he was a true revolutionary impelled by a great sense of mission to overturn the residual feudal and Stalinist structures of the ancient regime.
He was the outsider whose genius led to the overthrow of an entrenched and deeply loathed dictatorship.
His message of social justice and modernisation resonated with many in the homeland, especially the marginalised "lowlanders" in Oromia and Ogadenia.
His concept of revolutionary democracy and ethnic federalism promised to create a fairer and inclusive order.
Measured against these lofty and progressive ideals, his record has, at best, been patchy and rather uninspiring.
The much-vaunted ambitious economic modernisation and liberalisation programme has created a new middle class, attracted huge foreign investment, spawned massive infrastructure projects, spurred economic growth and generally transformed the skylines of the major cities such as Addis Ababa and Mekele.
But it has not tackled the deep structural and systemic problems and inefficiencies that have hampered real growth. The Stalinist land tenure system and the complex bureaucratic system are still intact, and the vast majority remain trapped in poverty.
The democratisation and political reform process, which Mr Meles himself termed "work in progress", has long stalled.
Since the disputed May 2005 polls, the regime has increasingly become intolerant and autocratic, using a raft of new legislation to stifle and criminalise dissent and lock up opponents.
Why West will miss Meles
Obituary: Meles Zenawi
Life in pictures: Ethiopia's Meles Zenawi
A plethora of old and new armed ethnic factions continue to wage low-level insurgencies in the periphery. The new policy of engagement and piecemeal peace pacts with a select few has so far only succeeded in managing the problem and buying the regime more time.
Feeling vulnerable and insecure, Mr Meles has in the last few years become a leader whose overriding domestic political manoeuvres and calculations are driven by one instinct: regime survival.
He orchestrated a discreet purge of the ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) and the administration, demoting, sidelining or reassigning key potential rivals and opponents.
His death has certainly created a leadership vacuum at the top and with no clear figure groomed to succeed him, the battle for succession could prove destabilising.
That said, the prospect of a large-scale upheaval, as some fear, is highly unlikely, partly because the country has a powerful, highly disciplined and cohesive army and security apparatus.
The opposition can, in theory, capitalise on the disarray within the ruling party to advance its goals and press for an early poll, but that looks difficult given the narrow factionalism and disorganisation within its ranks, not to mention the fact most of the influential opposition figures are either in exile or locked up.
Mr Meles has continued to enjoy good press in the region and across much of Africa, even as his stature diminished domestically.
He is hugely admired and many seem prepared to overlook his personal frailties and forgive his leadership shortcomings for one simple reason: no other African leader has in recent times deployed such great intellectual energy and firepower and used his diplomatic talent and influence to articulate the continent's key priorities and demands at global forums.
He did put Africa on the map, and as a skilled and effective negotiator and spokesman he certainly forced leaders in the developed world to listen. But whether this feat alone qualifies him to join the pantheon of the continent's great visionaries, like Kwame Nkrumah and Nelson Mandela, remains debatable.
Not in contention though is the fact that the late prime minister - almost single-handedly - transformed Ethiopia from a deeply conflicted and war-wracked peripheral Horn of Africa state into a supremely self-assured African diplomatic and military powerhouse.
From the mid-1990s and up until 2005, Ethiopia was a key stop for high-level Western dignitaries visiting the continent, and Mr Meles the must-see African leader whose advice and counsel was sought.
Many embraced him as a reformer and an elite member of the so-called "new breed" of African leaders.
The Ethiopian leader cultivated the new friendship and used it to forge strategic partnerships to raise his country's profile and advance its geopolitical and strategic national interests.
He swiftly rebuilt and modernised the army, initially in a bid to achieve parity with Sudan and negotiate a detente from a position of strength, but subsequently to "tame" a belligerent Eritrea, with whom relations had began to dramatically deteriorate a few years after its independence in 1991.
The two countries have since fought two bloody and costly border wars beginning from 1998. A peace pact and a border arbitration treaty brokered by international mediators failed to end to conflict permanently, partly because Addis Ababa refused to fully abide by the terms of the accords and to return the tiny barren piece of land awarded to Eritrea.
Hostilities have continued to simmer ever since, and periodic flare-ups are common along the volatile border.
It is plausible the death of Mr Meles may - far from creating opportunities for dialogue - spur Eritrea into escalating the tension.
That would be a disastrous and risky gamble which Eritrea must be dissuaded from taking. It is unlikely this is a course of action that would help it secure its perceived legitimate rights, much less win it friends in the region and beyond.
In Somalia, Ethiopia's military presence in the past year has been instrumental in putting the pressure on the militant group al-Shabab. Thousands of Ethiopian troops now control a number of key strategic areas in south-central Somalia.
The death of Mr Meles has raised new anxieties among the regional allies with troops in Somalia.
There are growing fears a destabilising succession battle and power struggle in Addis could potentially complicate matters and jeopardise the whole mission. Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga said as much in a recent radio interview.
Such fears are understandable, considering Ethiopia's history and political fragility.
However, there is hope too the country has achieved a level of maturity and that it has the institutional mechanisms and the structural resilience to weather the current storm and ensure a smooth transition that allows for policy continuity in Somalia.

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence. The death of Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi has raised concerns about the potential for a power struggle in Addis Ababa and its impact on the region, particularly in Somalia where Ethiopian troops are fighting

Investors were expecting a bigger cut in the rates, analysts said.
Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index was down 1.7% to 19,606.32 points.
Evan Lucas, market strategist at trading firm IG said Friday's shares sell-off is because there was over-excitement and high expectations for what the ECB would deliver at its policy meeting.
"I have been fully aware that last night's ECB meeting would be the biggest 'disappointment' event of the week," he wrote in a note.
The six month extension of its stimulus program was seen as the bare minimum, because traders were looking for a one-year extension of the plan - or even an open-ended plan.
"What the market 'wanted' versus what the market was 'going to get' were two distinctly different events," Mr Lucas said.
Chinese markets followed global markets lower with Shanghai Composite index down 1% to 3,549.51, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index lost 1.2% to 22,158.57.

Article: An unsolicited email from Apple inviting publishers to join the service presumes acceptance of the terms, unless they actively opt out.
It requires them to cover Apple if legal issues arise, among other things.
Apple, which is due to launch the app later this year, refused to comment on the row.
The terms read: "If we receive a legal claim about your RSS content, we will tell you so that you can resolve the issue, including indemnifying Apple if Apple is included in the claim."
Agreement to that, and other terms, is a prerequisite for being included in the forthcoming app.
However, a line in the email from Apple made clear that publishers not wishing to be bound by them would be expected to say so explicitly.
That has led some to express concern that they would be bound by the agreement perhaps without ever having seen it or actively consenting to it.
Other terms in the email allow Apple to place adverts next to publishers' publicly available content without paying them.
The BBC has spoken to three online publishers about the move.
One of them, Mike Ash said he thought it was "wrong of Apple" to presume that he would indemnify them. He said the email was "presumptuous".
And, in a blogpost entitled I Do Not Agree To Your Terms, he took issue with the requirement to opt out.
He wrote: "Let me get this straight, Apple: you send me an email outlining the terms under which you will redistribute my content, and you will just assume that I agree to your terms unless I opt out?
"You're going to consider me bound to terms you just declared to me in an email as long as I don't respond? That's completely crazy. You don't even know if I received the email!"
According to Graham Hann, the head of technology, media and communications at the law firm Taylor Wessing, the terms of the deal are broadly in line with industry standards - except the requirement to opt out.
"The content of the notice is not unusual, although it has deliberately been dumbed down, possibly for clarity," he told the BBC.
"However, the optout approach is very unusual and I don't see how the notice could form a binding contract without a positive reply.
"Apple clearly wants to launch with as much content as possible and has taken this risk-based approach. Some publishers may object and even threaten to sue.
"However, I think it would be hard to claim damage beyond a reasonable royalty fee."
Apple will place the publishers' content via a publicly available RSS feed, which sends any updates to a blog or website to the host - in this case, Apple News.
Publishers make these feeds publicly available voluntarily.
After announcing the launch of the app, the company began advertising for editorial staff to work on it, indicating that it would be curated by a human editor, rather than an algorithm.
The news app is categorised as part of the firm's marketing department.
It is due to be launched with the latest operating system update - iOS9 - later in 2015.
Apple also announced at the WWDC developers' conference that it was launching a music streaming app that would include the user's music video library, as well as an internet radio station and a way for artists to share unreleased tracks.

Apple's forthcoming news app has been criticised over claims the company is hoodwinking bloggers into accepting its terms and conditions.

The Manchester-born man reportedly had a "special obsession" with a girl he taught.
He was arrested in Valladolid, north-west Spain as part of an Interpol investigation.
Interpol said they discovered illegal files were being sent from an email address in Spain and alerted the authorities.
Police said on Sunday the teacher is suspected of using a cloud storage service to keep and share the pictures between computers and with others.
Officers say they found a large number of sexually explicit files involving minors at the home of the teacher.
He kept photos of one girl in a dedicated folder on his computer but had not shared the images he had secretly taken of his underage students.
Police said they believe he previously lived in the Seville area.
Spanish National Police said: "At the moment, [police are] trying to establish the identity of the victims shown in the images found on the electronic devices belonging to the detained."

Article: Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that the Russian air force would continue its support of the Syrian armed forces.
He also urged Washington to deliver on a pledge to separate moderate Syrian opposition fighters from "terrorists".
US Secretary of State John Kerry warned the US was "on the verge" of suspending talks with Russia over Syria.
"It's irrational, in the context of the kind of bombing taking place, to be sitting there, trying to take things seriously," he told a conference in Washington.
"There is no notion or indication of seriousness of purpose with what is taking place right now."
The Russian foreign ministry said a US refusal to co-operate would be a gift to "terrorists".
The US and Russia have been negotiating for months to try to secure a cessation of hostilities but the latest truce collapsed last week after only a few days and attacks on eastern Aleppo have since intensified.
The US warned on Wednesday it would end talks on military co-operation unless Moscow stopped the bombing.
The recent cessation deal was meant to lead to joint Russian-US air strikes on so-called Islamic State and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (formerly known as al-Nusra Front).
However Russia has complained the US has not done enough to separate the more moderate rebel groups, which it backs, from Jabhat Fateh al-Sham. Many of these groups have formed a strategic alliance with the more powerful Jabhat Fateh al-Sham and fight alongside it.
Despite growing tensions between the two nations, Mr Peskov said Russia remains interested in pursuing talks with the US in an effort to resolve the crisis in Syria.
His comments echo a statement from Moscow, which insisted it would send diplomats to Geneva to discuss ways of normalising the situation with the US.
US Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday that national security agencies were reviewing all options to try to end the Syrian civil war.
He said President Barack Obama had asked "all of the agencies to put forward options, some familiar, some new, that we are very actively reviewing".
"When we are able to work through these in the days ahead we'll have an opportunity to come back and talk about them in detail," he said.
Meanwhile Turkey has said it will work with Russia on putting in place another ceasefire after the previous agreement collapsed.
Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told reporters in Ankara "we are more than ready" but emphasised that nations have to try harder to find a political resolution in order for an agreement to be effective.
Aleppo has come under heavy aerial bombardment since the partial truce deal disintegrated a week ago.
Some 250,000 people are trapped in the east in appalling conditions, under siege from Russian-backed Syrian forces.
UN aid chief Stephen O'Brien has warned that Aleppo is facing an unprecedented humanitarian crisis.
Mr O'Brien, the under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, told the UN Security Council Aleppo had descended into a "merciless abyss of humanitarian catastrophe unlike any we have witnessed in Syria".
The US has accused Russia of taking part in strikes on civilian targets and possibly committing war crimes - charges Russia has strongly denied.

Article: Lee Tomlin's penalty lit up a quiet first period after Tammy Abraham was brought down in the box by Ipswich keeper Bartosz Bialkowski.
David McGoldrick almost levelled the scores soon after half-time, but his low shot was pushed on to the post by Ipswich goalkeeper Frank Fielding.
Luke Freeman sealed the win with a spectacular volley from 25 yards.
The victory was just a second in eight league games for City and lifted the Robins up to 11th in the table, while Town drop to 16th.
Aden Flint felt he should have had a second penalty for City as he went down in the box five minutes after the first spot-kick, but referee Stuart Attwell waved away his protests.
Abraham had a chance to double the lead just before the break, but the 12-goal Chelsea loanee headed over the impressive Tomlin's cross.
After McGoldrick hit the post, Freeman came up with a goal of the season contender as he smashed home a left-foot volley from far outside the box into the bottom corner for his first goal at Ashton Gate.
Bristol City boss Lee Johnson:
"It was a sensational goal. It is a really difficult skill to get the ball to dip from the position Luke struck it.
"It was a really steady and professional team display, almost like an away performance. We have had to come from behind so often, but today we got ourselves in front and looked really solid.
"We haven't got what we deserved from recent games. Now we are three points off the play-offs and looking up the table again."
Ipswich Town manager Mick McCarthy:
"The difference between the teams was a penalty and a worldie. They started well, but we got to grips with that.
"We were on top when an unbelievable flying bomb hit the top corner of our net for the second goal. It was absolutely unstoppable.
"I have no complaints about our display. We need to be more effective in the final third, but other than that I felt we competed well against a good side."

Article: Cuadrilla, the firm behind the tests, said drilling had been suspended as a precaution after the 1.5 magnitude tremor - the second in two months.
It will now examine the data collected by the British Geological Survey (BGS) before deciding whether to resume.
A tremor centred on Poulton-le-Fylde on 1 April shared a "similar location and mechanism", the BSG said.
Shale gas drilling, known as "fracking", involves shattering hard shale rocks underground to release gas using either hydraulic pressure or tiny explosions.
Mark Miller, chief executive of Cuadrilla Resources, said: "We take our responsibilities very seriously and that is why we have stopped fracking operations to share information and consult with the relevant authorities and other experts.
"We expect that this analysis and subsequent consultation will take a number of weeks to conclude and we will decide on appropriate actions after that."
The process has proved controversial in the US with environmentalists alleging that shale gas leaking into their drinking supply could cause tap water to ignite.
But earlier this month the Commons energy select committee called on ministers to support the process in the UK arguing that environmental problems associated with it in the US could be overcome by tight regulation and good industry practice.
The BGS said it was also monitoring fracking as a precaution. There have been two small earthquakes in Lancashire since fracking began in the county in March, including the latest on Friday.
In an analysis of the April quake published on its website the BGS said: "Any process that injects pressurised water into rocks at depth will cause the rock to fracture and possibly produce earthquakes.
"It is well known that injection of water or other fluids during the oil extraction and geothermal engineering, such as Shale gas, processes can result in earthquake activity."
The BGS said the April tremor took place 1.2 miles (2km) away from the drilling site but said its monitoring instruments were 50 miles (80km) away.
Speaking about the latest quake, Dr Brian Baptie, head of seismology at the BGS, said: "The earthquake was felt by at least one person in Poulton-Le-Fylde.
"Our analysis places the epicentre of the event to within 2km of the Preese Hall site.
"Data from two temporary instruments close to the drill site, installed after the magnitude 2.3 earthquake on 1 April, indicate that the event occurred at a depth of approximately 2km (1.2 miles).
"The recorded waveforms are very similar to those from the magnitude 2.3 event last month, which suggests that the two events share a similar location and mechanism."

Article: Russia is fuming, in the words of BBC Moscow correspondent Steve Rosenberg, but US politicians have not minced their words either.
Here is a taster of what's being said and shared.
Tweet by Dmitry Medvedev, Russian prime minister
"Sad that the Obama administration, which started its life with a reset, ends it in anti-Russian death throes."
"The outgoing American administration led by Barack Obama, while accusing Russia of all deadly sins, trying to accuse us, among other things, of the failure of its foreign policy initiatives, as you know, without grounds, has brought forward additional accusations that the Russian side - at state level - was interfering with the US electoral campaign, as a result of which the Democratic candidate lost. Yesterday the US administration, without presenting any facts, any evidence, announced a new wave of sanctions against Russia."
Maria Zakharova, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman, in a post on Facebook headlined 'Obama's Coming Out'
"The people who have lived eight years in the White House are not an administration but a group of vindictive, unimaginative, foreign policy failures. Today [US President Barack] Obama admitted this officially.
"Most surprising of all is that after failing to record any achievements in the international arena in the history of his presidency, the Nobel laureate has managed to sign off not with a flourish, but a blot...
"Today America, the American people, has been humiliated by its own president. Not by international terrorists, not by enemy troops. This time it's Washington's chief delivering the slap in the face, ramping up the workload for the incoming team..."
Zakharova says Jews backed Trump
"Such actions of the administration in Washington are the demonstration, unfortunately, of an unpredictable, even aggressive, I can say, foreign policy. We think that such decisions of the acting administration, which is supposed to be in office for three more weeks, pursue two aims: finally (irrevocably?) spoiling US-Russian relations and, obviously, having an impact on the foreign policy of the future administration of the president-elect [Donald Trump]."
"What these individuals were doing were basically collecting intelligence. They were intelligence officers operating here and using these compounds, one in New York, one in Maryland, for intelligence collection purposes. And what we are saying today is, in response to and in order to impose consequences for the Russian government's increasing harassment and aggression toward our personnel in Moscow, and, of course, their malicious cyber-activities, interfering and an effort to interfere in our election process, we are imposing consequences."
"They [the Russians] are trying to destabilize democracy all over the world, not just here. It's just not about pulling for Trump, it's bigger than that. They're trying to break the backs of democracies.
"Here's what we should do. We should tell the Russians that on no uncertain terms, you interfere in our elections, we don't care why, we're going to hit you and hit you hard. I'm going to introduce sanctions, they will be bipartisan that names Putin as an individual, his inner circle, for not only hacking into our political systems but trying to destabilize democracy throughout the world."
"We need to get to the bottom of this. We need to find out exactly what was done and what the implications of the attacks were, especially if they had an effect on our election.
"There's no doubt they were interfering and no doubt it was a cyber-attack. The question now is how much and what damage and what should the United States of America do? And so far, we've been totally paralyzed."
"Russia does not share America's interests. In fact, it has consistently sought to undermine them, sowing dangerous instability around the world. While today's action by the administration is overdue, it is an appropriate way to end eight years of failed policy with Russia. And it serves as a prime example of this administration's ineffective foreign policy that has left America weaker in the eyes of the world."

Article: Instead of fees rising to £9,250 per year in the autumn, Jeremy Corbyn is proposing a complete handbrake turn in saying that university tuition should not cost students anything.
It's a bolder step than Labour's previous leader, who two years ago opted for a halfway house of cutting fees to £6,000 - and then was accused of pleasing no-one.
This is Labour going for an all-or-nothing approach - asserting free education as a fundamental principle - and creating the starkest choice in university policy for two decades.
It's a direct appeal to younger voters - with surveys suggesting that students are more likely to vote Labour.
It makes the pitch that no-one should be deterred from university because of the cost or fear of debt.
Labour has costed the removal of fees - and the reintroduction of maintenance grants - as being worth £11.2bn per year.
And this is only England - because education funding is a devolved matter. There are no fees for Scottish students in Scotland and the Institute for Fiscal Studies says scrapping the lower fees charged in Northern Ireland and Wales would cost a further £500m per year.
This would be covered by the £48.6bn that Labour's manifesto says will be raised by tax changes - along with the party's other spending commitments.
But there are lower estimates.
Labour's figure is based on replacing the fees currently paid by students.
But the IFS and London Economics say the cost to the Treasury could be lower, when written off loans are taken into account, with forecasts around £7.5bn to £8bn.
Labour's big move on fees represents a complete of direction. Previously in government, Labour raised fees and in opposition proposed a modest reduction.
But they are now proposing to bulldoze the apparatus of fees, loans and repayments.
The most recent figures show £76bn is owed in student loans in England - with this level of student debt having almost doubled in four years.
From this autumn, fees will begin increasing every year with inflation and will soon glide past the £10,000 mark, with interest charges also rising to 6.1%.
And the Conservative government, before the election, had announced plans to sell off student debt to private investors.
Under Labour's plans, this whole push towards marketisation would be ditched - and universities would return to being directly funded by government.
But is there any evidence that getting rid of fees would help more young people into university, including the disadvantaged?
Universities are worried that such a switch to direct funding, dependent on government finances, would put a limit on places and a brake on expansion.
One of the quiet revolutions of recent years has been the complete removal of limits on student numbers - with universities able to recruit as many students as they can accommodate - and opening the door to rising numbers of graduates.
The argument for fees has always been that they provide the funding to allow more young people to go to university - and that a much smaller proportion went to university when there were no fees.
This year has seen a fall of 5% in university applications from UK students - and it follows a pattern of dips when fees are increased.
But the long-term trend has been relentlessly upwards, with a huge growth in demand for university places. It remains a powerful symbol of family aspiration.
Although wealthy families remain much more likely to send their children to university - entry rates have risen across all social classes, including the poorest.
Do students get value for money from tuition fees? Is this an investment that is repaid in better job prospects?
Department for Education figures published last month showed that graduates remained more likely to be in a job than non-graduates and on average earned £10,000 per year more.
Among younger people, this graduate advantage is less, at £6,000 per year.
But the figures also showed that, despite rises in fees, graduate salaries have stagnated over the past decade.
Labour's plan sends a strong political signal to young voters.
A survey from the Higher Education Policy Institute, taken before the manifesto publication, suggested that Labour is now more popular among students than it was in any of the three previous general elections.
The survey found Labour significantly ahead in the student vote.
The Liberal Democrats, once the most popular party for students, are trailing in third behind the Conservatives.
Is this still the cloud of tuition fees hanging over the Lib Dems from their U-turn during the coalition government?
Could they really entirely scrap fees?
There will be plenty of scrutiny over funding Labour's plans. But there is nothing unprecedented or outlandish about getting rid of fees.
Germany has phased out tuition fees - and universities in the Netherlands and Scandinavia try to recruit students from England with the offer of low or no fees.
French undergraduates can study for low fees.
In the United States, New York state is introducing free fees for students from families earning up to about £100,000 per year, offering a handout to the squeezed middle classes.
There are now leading universities in the US which have lower tuition fees than in England. The University of Washington charges less than the University of Wolverhampton.
And the most immediate example of getting rid of fees has been in Scotland.
For England's voters, Labour's undiluted policy on tuition fees - proposing their complete abolition - offers the sharpest divide in the road for decades.

Article: Danny McKay, 36, was shot dead at his home on Longlands Road in Newtownabbey last Thursday at 20:30 BST.
Before the murder, five masked men entered a house at Dunore Court in Belfast's New Lodge and forced the occupant to hand over his VW Bora.
At 20:50 BST the VW was found burnt-out in Ardmoulin Place in the Falls. Police believe the incidents are linked.
Detectives from the PSNI's serious crime branch, working with uniformed officers, returned to all three locations on Thursday to talk to local people and passers-by.
The officer leading the investigation, DCI John McVea, said: "We have made a number of arrests but this investigation will continue for some time. This was a brutal murder and we are asking for people's assistance."
He said they were also keen to speak to anyone who may have seen a dark coloured saloon car "being driven in a suspicious manner" in the Longlands area in the days before the murder.
"Our final appeal is about a man with a light-coloured top seen running away from the burning car at Ardmoulin Place. If you can provide information about this, we need to hear from you," he added.
A 25-year-old man was arrested by police on Thursday morning in north Belfast and is being questioned about the murder at Antrim police station. A number of other people arrested in connection with the killing have been released.

West Sussex chief fire officer Sean Ruth said the recovery operation was "extremely challenging" for crews.
Sussex Police have also finished their work at the scene, but their investigations are continuing.
Mr Ruth said the fire service had been "truly humbled" by the messages of support it had received.
"The thoughts and prayers of everyone at West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service continue to be with the families and friends of those killed and injured in the Shoreham Air Show tragedy," he said.
He anticipated that Friday would be the last day his crews worked at the scene and wanted to thank people for the "over-whelming support we have received".
"In my 27 years of service I have never experienced such an outpouring of gratitude and respect as I have received on behalf of West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service over the last few weeks - from letters and emails, to words of thanks in the street, and from visitors at a number of our local fire stations," he said.
Det Chief Insp Carwyn Hughes, of Sussex Police, said: "Our officers and staff have been meticulous and have worked hard over the past three weeks to find answers for the victims' families.
"We have now finished work on the A27, however our investigation continues."
On Thursday, the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said it wanted to interview 51-year-old pilot Andy Hill as soon as possible.
Reports that Mr Hill, a former RAF pilot from Sandon, near Buntingford in Hertfordshire, had left hospital have not been confirmed by police.
An initial AAIB report said Mr Hill was thrown clear of the aircraft during the later part of the crash, but it is not clear whether he initiated his ejection.
After the crash, the pilot's family issued a statement which said they were devastated and deeply saddened by the loss of life and sent prayers and heartfelt condolences to the families of all those affected.

Article: The move comes a day after the Cincinnati Zoo said it was "not amused" by enduring memes over the gorilla's death.
Staff members fatally shot Harambe in May after a three-year-old boy climbed into his enclosure.
The death was subject to controversy, prompting angry tweets and petitions.
Zoo 'not amused' by Harambe memes
Cincinnati Zoo director Thane Maynard said on Monday the staff was "still healing" from the incident and the outpour of online memes and satire was making it difficult to move on from Harambe's loss.
The 17-year-old gorilla's death sparked international outrage and the boy's mother faced online scrutiny regarding her parenting skills.
Prosecutors decided not to press charges against the mother.
The zoo reopened its Gorilla World exhibit in June. The exhibit included reinforced barrier designed to prevent further accidents.
But online, numerous memes, petitions and hashtags such as #JusticeForHarambe cropped up in the gorilla's honour. Over time, Harembe became popular shorthand in social media humour.
Some pranksters called for the animal to be put on the dollar bill, while a poll in Texas suggested he would receive 2% of the popular vote in the US presidential election.
The memes took a racist turn in June when retired Australian football player Adam Goodes and Ghostbusters actress Leslie Jones were compared to an image of Harambe.
Mr Maynard's Twitter account was also hacked over the weekend.
The zoo's Twitter account was continuously flooded with references to Harambe before it was erased on Tuesday. For every Tweet they posted, no matter the subject, the zoo received dozens of replies referencing the gorilla.

Article: Dan Coats also told a Senate panel he did not think it was "appropriate" to discuss his conversations with the president at a public hearing.
His comments follow a report that President Donald Trump asked him to derail the Russia investigation.
The National Security Agency chief also declined to comment on the matter.
Admiral Mike Rogers told a Senate intelligence committee on Wednesday he has never "been directed to do anything illegal, immoral, unethical or inappropriate" as NSA director.
Mr Coats echoed Mr Rogers' statements as senators pressed the pair on their interactions with the president.
"I'm willing to come before the committee and tell you what I know and don't know," he said. "What I'm not willing to do is share information I think ought to be protected in an opening hearing," Mr Coats told the panel.
He is later appearing in a closed session before the committee on Wednesday afternoon.
This Senate testimony by intelligence community heads was billed as the undercard to James Comey's appearance on Capitol Hill on Thursday, but it turned out to be a big letdown.
Top intelligence officials in the US government have taken a bunker mentality when it comes to the investigation into Russian meddling in the US election, refusing to share details of presidential conversations in open Senate testimony. Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation, it seems, has the spooks spooked.
That may come as a relief to a White House that has been buffeted by a seemingly never-ending stream of controversial revelations, from allegations that the president attempted to influence the investigation into former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn to reports of internal divisions within the administration.
The president and his aides shouldn't breath easy, however. Although today's testimony was largely a dud, Mr Comey - no longer a government employee, thanks to Mr Trump - will have more leeway to discuss his interactions with the president if he so chooses.
His former colleagues my have seen discretion as the better part of valour, but the former director isn't known for backing down from a fight.
Mr Coats testimony comes a day after the Washington Post reported that he told associates Mr Trump had tried to persuade the FBI to back off their investigation into his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and his ties to the Kremlin.
US intelligence agencies believe Russia interfered in the US election and they are investigating alleged links between the Trump campaign and Moscow.
But there is no known evidence of collusion and President Donald Trump has dismissed the story as "fake news".
The two intelligence chiefs joined acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to testify before the panel on Wednesday.
The lack of answers appeared to frustrate both Democratic and Republican senators, who repeatedly pressed the intelligence officials on the Russia inquiry.
Republican Senator Richard Burr, who chairs the committee, ended the hearing by appearing to rebuke the intelligence officials for their testimony.
"At no time should you be in a position where you come to Congress without an answer," he said.
The following day will see the much-anticipated testimony of Mr Comey, who was leading one of the Russia investigations before Mr Trump fired him.
He will be quizzed on his interactions with the president before he was sacked.
Mr Comey reportedly told Attorney General Jeff Sessions that he did not want to be left alone with the president.
The conversation occurred the day after the president asked Mr Comey to end the investigation into Mr Flynn during a private dinner, according to the New York Times.
Mr Comey believed the attorney general should protect the FBI from White House influence, officials told the paper.

Article: The Local Government Information Unit said 94% of the 131 councils it spoke to were intending to put up bills, with their finances at "breaking point".
A third of these, 34% in total, intend to hike bills by more than 2% in April.
Councils, many of whom have frozen bills in recent years, say it will not be enough to plug the funding "gap" exacerbated by the cost of social care.
But the government says council tax is expected to be lower in real terms at the end of this Parliament than it was in 2010.
Although councils in Wales were included in the survey, the Welsh government has said it will not allow councils to raise bills to pay for social care.
Ministers say they are bringing forward money to help councils pay for social care by increasing the "precept" - a supplement that councils are able to charge on bills - from 2% to 5% over the next two years.
Years of cuts to central government funding since 2011 have put pressure on the budgets of the 375 councils in England and Wales, with many paring back core services. Financial pressures on county councils and unitary authorities that provide adult social care have become particularly acute in the past year.
Surrey County Council abandoned controversial plans this week to hold a referendum on a 15% rise in council tax which it said was needed to pay for social care. It will now increase bills by 4.99% - the maximum it can do without holding a public vote.
Labour have accused the government of doing a sweetheart deal with the Tory-controlled council to call off the referendum - claims it denies.
Publishing its research, the Local Government Information Unit said five district councils which do not provide social care had wanted to hold local referendums to sanction council tax rises above 2% but had "thought better" of it in recent weeks.
Inflation, as measured by the CPI index, currently stands at 1.6% but is projected to rise to 2.7% next year.
The LGIU said there was growing concern in town halls that the current system of funding local authorities - through a mixture of government grants, council tax and other income streams such as business rates and parking charges - would become unsustainable in the near future.
Of the 163 council chiefs - across 131 local authorities - which responded to its survey, 42% said future cuts would be "noticed" by residents while one in 10 feared the situation might become so serious that they would no longer be able to fulfil their councils' legal obligations to provide certain services.
A number of county councils - including Newcastle, North Tyneside, South Tyneside and Sunderland - have already said they will add the full 3% "social care precept" to council tax bills next year and many others are expected to follow suit.
Jonathan Carr-West, chief executive of the LGIU, said: "Local government finances are at breaking point."
"We see councils around the country patching their budgets by raising council tax, drawing on their reserves and increasing charging. They have very little confidence in the sustainability of the system.
"Councils are allowed to place a 3% precept on council tax to fund adult social care - nine out of 10 of them saying it is not enough money and won't meet the gap. Councils are going to retain 100% of the new business rates - half of councils tell us they think they will be worse off under that new system post-2020."
He said councils were being frustrated in their efforts to address the problems themselves with revenue-raising measures such as greater scope for charging, local hotel taxes and a re-evaluation of council tax bands "off the government's agenda".
"None of these are wild and wacky ideas. They are things that are done in other countries, in the US, France and Spain and they work.
"Here they are not even part of the conversation. That needs to change."
A spokesman for the Department of Communities and Local Government said: "Council tax is expected to be lower in real terms at the end of this Parliament than it was in 2010 and we've protected residents by allowing them to veto excessive rises at a local referendum.
"Our historic four-year funding settlement gives local authorities the certainty they need to plan ahead, with almost £200bn available to provide the services that local people most value.
"We've also announced an additional £900m for social care, meaning councils will have £7.6bn of dedicated funding to spend over the four years."

Article: As part of our fight against this, we have a very much underutilised tool - food.
In BBC One's Doctor in the House, I try to help 34-year-old Emma Gleeson, who has been experiencing anxiety, depression and panic attacks for many years.
She was 19 when she really began struggling with mental health.
Following a severe episode of pneumonia, she ended up in intensive care in a coma.
When she woke up she was petrified. She developed an extreme fear of death, and this can precipitate her panic attacks.
During an attack, Emma feels terrified, and can often scream out loud.
It is extremely worrying for her family and can be scary to onlookers.
Emma has tried various medications and counselling therapies but was still struggling and getting three to four panic attacks per day.
One of the ways in which I helped her was by changing her food choices.
Despite being sceptical at first, I was able to show Emma the hidden power of food in helping her mental state.
"I had been living on a diet of takeaways, fizzy drinks and general processed and convenience foods for as long as I can remember, and didn't for one moment think that what I ate was contributing in any way to the anxiety and panic attacks I'd been experiencing for years," she said.
"Since meeting and spending time with Dr Rangan, he has changed my entire outlook on food, and why certain foods were potentially having a negative impact on my mental health.
"I now only buy and cook with fresh food, I make my own stocks, I eat plenty of fish and I try to reduce the amount of sugar I consume.
"I feel so much better and intend to keep this up."
The evidence of food's link to mental states has been growing.
A landmark 2015 article in the prestigious Lancet journal stated that nutrition may be as important to mental health as it is to cardiology, endocrinology and gastroenterology.
Plus, a small but important interventional Australian study from earlier this year showed that a modified Mediterranean diet significantly helped many patients with severe depression within 12 weeks.
Unfortunately, this has not translated into routine patient care and most doctors still do not discuss food with their mental health patients.
This has to change.
Many of us do not think about how food can impact the way we feel, but we all know the feeling of using food as a quick pick-me-up.
When we are feeling a little tired, a little stressed or a little low, we often reach for a sugary snack to help us feel good in the short term.
But, this can actually make things worse in the long term.
The food you are eating is literally "shocking" your body.
By changing her diet, as well as reducing her alcohol intake, Emma experienced a reduction in anxiety, an improvement in mood and fewer panic attacks.
She also described feeling mentally stronger, having a clearer head, more energy and a greater ability to cope with stress.
It has also encouraged her to be more active and do more things at weekends, which also helps her mental health.
Of course, there can be many other factors to consider with mental health problems and it is always worth getting advice from a qualified healthcare professional.
There can be many other important factors to consider with mental health problems, such as emotional trauma and stress, but we should not underestimate the power of changing our food to improve our mood.
As a doctor, I like to empower my patients. Here are four of the tips that helped Emma, that can also help you:
1. Reduce sugar and processed foods
Sugar, food that contains sugar, or even food that is converted quickly into sugar, such as many breakfast cereals, cause your blood sugar to rapidly rise.
Within two to three hours your sugar levels then start to fall.
At this point, you may not only feel hungry, you can feel "h-angry" as well - hungry and angry.
Low and falling blood sugar levels can cause a rise in your body's stress hormones, cortisol and adrenaline.
This can have a negative impact on your mood.
2. Increase your intake of Omega-3 fats
This is an essential nutrient for brain function and may protect against anxiety and other psychiatric disorders.
Foods high in Omega-3 fats include fatty fish (salmon, mackerel, anchovies), grass-fed meat, seeds and leafy vegetables.
3. Eat more tryptophan-containing foods like pork, chicken, seeds and walnuts
Tryptophan is an amino acid the body converts into serotonin, your feel-good neurotransmitter.
Eat them with a healthy carbohydrate source such as sweet potatoes, which helps to transport more tryptophan into your blood.
4. Feed your gut bugs
Some scientists refer to the trillions of gut bugs that live inside us, the gut microbiota, as the brain's peacekeepers.
It is thought that having a healthy population of gut bugs can have a significant influence on your mood via the gut-brain axis.
The prebiotic fibre contained in vegetables help your gut bugs to proliferate, so the best way to maintain a healthy population is to increase your intake of vegetables, as well as fermented foods such as sauerkraut.
Best options are leeks, onions, garlic, artichokes and cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower.
You have the ability to improve the way you feel by controlling what you put on your plate.

Article: About 10 hotels, pubs and club houses were also closed, officials said.
Some estimates put Lagos' population at around 20 million, creating a constant background of noise - from the blaring of car horns, to the Muslim call to prayer and loud singing in churches.
The state government has vowed to make the city, the biggest in Africa, noise-free by 2020.
Africa Live: More on this and other news stories
In August, the Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency (LEPA) closed 22 premises after residents complained about noise emanating from them.
Following the latest crackdown, its general manager Bola Shabi said the agency would no longer allow people to pray in makeshift buildings and tents.
Mr Shabi said noise levels had been reduced by about 35%, but this was not a "pass mark yet".
"Enforcement is a continuous exercise and we have set a target for ourselves. We want to ensure that Lagos is noise-free by the year 2020," he said.
Mr Shabi said mosques complied with their instructions more than churches because when they are ordered to shut down, they "instantly bring down their speakers or reduce the noise they make''.
Nigerians are extremely religious, with a large number of evangelical churches operating in Lagos.
Christians form the majority in the city.
In 2014, 116 people died when a building owned by popular televangelist TB Joshua collapsed in Lagos.

Article: The Alabama Securities Commission led the investigation, which helps prevent financial fraud against the elderly.
After an agent interviewed Lee, the commission's head said he was satisfied she wanted a second book published.
The new work - Go Set a Watchman - will be the 88-year-old American author's first release since the 1960s.
The surprise move prompted some suggestions Lee was manipulated into publishing the decades-old manuscript, which was discovered by her lawyer in the author's possessions last year.
"We closed the file. Let's just say that she was able to answer questions we asked to our satisfaction from our point of view,'' said Joseph Borg, Alabama Securities Commission director.
The New York Times reported that the investigation was sparked by requests from a doctor that the state investigate whether Lee was capable to have consented to the release of the work.
Lee herself was "extremely hurt" by allegations she was manipulated, her lawyer Tonja Carter said.
To Kill a Mockingbird was published in July 1960 and has sold more than 40 million copies around the world.

It said if the trend continues these figures could rise to 288,000 by 2025.
Launching Diabetes Week, the charity said a lack of education on managing the condition had led to "devastating" health complications, including amputations, blindness and strokes.
According to the charity, many cases of type 2 diabetes can be prevented but there is no way of preventing type 1.
Diabetes costs NHS Wales nearly Â£500m a year, it added.
Diabetes UK Cymru's director Dai Williams said: "Over the last decade we have seen the number of people with diabetes rising at an alarming rate and these latest figures are a stark call to action.
"We must act now or face the very real danger of diabetes devastating the lives of even more people, and threatening to wreck the already over-burdened NHS."

Article: Washington blamed Russia and the Syrian government for intensifying their attacks against civilians.
Last week, the US warned it would halt the talks unless Moscow stops bombing the city of Aleppo.
Russia said it regretted the US move, accusing it of shifting the blame for the collapse of last month's truce.
Aleppo, Syria's largest city in the north, has come under heavy aerial bombardment since the end of the ceasefire two weeks ago.
The main trauma hospital in the rebel-held eastern part of the city was hit in an air strike for the third time in a week, activists said on Monday.
Hundreds of people, including children, have died since government forces launched an offensive to take full control of Aleppo after the week-long truce lapsed.
Some 250,000 people are trapped in eastern Aleppo.
In a statement, state department spokesman john Kirby said: "The United States is suspending its participation in bilateral channels with Russia that were established to sustain the cessation of hostilities.
"Unfortunately, Russia failed to live up to its own commitments... and was also either unwilling or unable to ensure Syrian regime adherence to the arrangements to which Moscow agreed.
"Rather, Russia and the Syrian regime have chosen to pursue a military course," Mr Kirby said, admitting that "this is not a decision that was taken lightly".
He said Moscow and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's troops had been "targeting of critical infrastructure such as hospitals, and preventing humanitarian aid from reaching civilians in need, including through the 19 September attack on a humanitarian aid convoy".
Moscow strongly denies involvement of its own or Syrian planes in the deadly aid convoy strike, and says the incident was caused by fire on the ground and not by an air strike.
In response to the US suspension of the talks, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said: "We regret this decision by Washington."
"Washington simply did not fulfil the key condition of the agreement to improve the humanitarian condition around Aleppo.
"After failing to fulfil the agreements that they themselves worked out, they are trying to shift responsibility on to someone else," Ms Zakharova said.
She also said that the US had failed to divide jihadist groups in Syria from the moderate opposition.
Russia and the US were due to convene in Geneva to try to co-ordinate air strikes against jihadist groups, but American officials were told to return home.
The US also said that it would withdraw personnel "that had been dispatched in anticipation of the possible establishment of the Joint (US-Russian) Implementation Centre".
However, the two sides would keep talking about counter-terrorism operations in Syria to avoid unnecessary clashes.

Article: The news has prompted headlines around the world, and Politicians and city leaders have taken to Twitter to congratulate him, including the left-leaning mayors of New York and Paris.
Congratulations also came from Ahok Basuki Purnama, the governor of Jakarta. He became Jakarta's first Christian governor in 50 years when he was elected in 2014.
Jemima Goldsmith, the sister of Conservative party rival Zac Goldsmith, congratulated Mr Khan on his victory. The ex-wife of Pakistani cricketer and politician Imran Khan also appeared to criticise her brother's campaign.
The New York Times describes Mr Khan's victory as "striking" and leads with the fact that he is London's first Muslim mayor. It described London as a city with an acute shortage of affordable homes and a creaking, overcrowded mass transit network.
A commentary in German news magazine Der Spiegel describes Mr Khan's win as a "victory over Islamophobia", and says London is breaking new ground. "The mayoral election shows that London is more liberal, clever and tolerant than the Conservative mudslingers would like to think," it says.
Qatari daily Al-Sharq says: "Once again, the British capital enters history, this time through the gate of democratic victory by electing a Muslim of immigrant descent as its mayor."
Pakistan's Dawn newspaper says that Khan should see himself as a role model for millions of Muslims living in Europe.
With the rise of increasingly popular right-wing parties across the continent, the paper's Brussels correspondent Shada Islam writes that "Khan's story should help set the record straight on immigration, integration and European Muslims".
History Professor Juan Cole points out that Mr Khan is by no means the first Muslim in charge of a European city. In a popular blog post he traces the history of Muslim rule in Spain, Greece, the Balkans, and Sicily. "Not to mention that Constantinople/Istanbul is one of the larger European cities... the mayor there is a Muslim," he says.
Baroness Sayeeda Warsi, former co-chair of the UK Conservative Party, and Business Secretary Sajid Javid congratulated Mr Khan and pointed out their similar backgrounds.
"Bus drivers are clearly the new Etonians" quipped writer and conservative activist Tim Montgomerie, referring to the elite public school attended by Prime Minister David Cameron and Mr Goldsmith.
In France's Le Figaro, London-based French essayist Laetitia Strauch-Bonnart says "two images of the United Kingdom" faced each other in this election: The "exemplary success story" of Mr Khan's life and "the billionaire's son", Mr Goldsmith.
"In order to appeal nowadays, it is better to have a disadvantaged background, a personal history made of difficulties and social mobility," she told the paper. "It's the spirit of the time, and Goldsmith was not on the right side."
Finally, before the result was in, former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt tweeted a warning about how Mr Khan could possibly be treated if Republican hopeful Donald Trump was to become US President.

Article: A university researcher sent 1,500 identical CVs to German firms - except that some bore the name Meryem Ozturk and others the name Sandra Bauer.
In 18.8% of cases Sandra Bauer was invited for interview, whereas the figure for Meryem was just 13.5%.
When the photo of Meryem showed her in a headscarf only 4.2% invited her.
The study was published by the Institute for the Study of Labour, in Bonn. The researcher was Doris Weichselbaumer from the University of Linz, in Austria.
The findings are especially significant in light of Germany's current efforts to integrate record numbers of Muslim migrants, many of them refugees from the conflicts in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.
More than a million asylum seekers reached Germany last year, and there has been a backlash from nationalist groups, especially Pegida and Alternative for Germany (AfD).
With an estimated three million people of Turkish origin, Germany is home to the largest Turkish diaspora.
In her study, Ms Weichselbaumer said that "a very modern binding of the headscarf was chosen to signal that the applicant was a young, modern woman who could easily fit into a secular environment".
It is normal in Germany to attach a photo to a job application, she pointed out.
The result of the experiment "implies that the candidate with the headscarf had to send 4.5 times as many applications as an identical applicant with a German name and no headscarf to receive the same number of callbacks for interview", she said.
Discrimination appeared to intensify when the job required a higher skill level. When Ms Ozturk in a headscarf was applying for a secretarial job she had to send off 3.5 times more applications than Ms Bauer. For the post of chief accountant Ms Ozturk had to make 7.6 times more applications.
Ms Weichselbaumer has found similar levels of discrimination in Austria. A female Nigerian job applicant was only half as successful as an Austrian woman in getting invitations to interview, her research showed in 2013.

Article: In a Scrubbing Up column for the BBC News, Nigel Edwards, chief executive of the Nuffield Trust, says the hundreds of millions of pounds it will cost could be better spent elsewhere.
He said other areas for investment include improving out-of-hospital services and tackling sepsis.
But Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told the BBC doctors agreed with him.
His claims come despite criticism from the British Medical Association, which has argued he has not given enough detail about the plans or explained how it will be funded.
The BMA has been given until next Friday to agree to discuss the plans with the government.
Plans for a seven-day NHS have provoked a bitter row between the government and doctors' representatives.
Ministers argue thousands of people die every year because there is not the same level of service at weekends as during the week.
The British Medical Association, which represents doctors, says the government has failed to set out what its policy means in practice, and what it will cost.
It points out that many doctors already work at weekends.
In an exclusive interview and article for the BBC's "Scrubbing Up" column, the Nuffield Trusts's chief executive, Nigel Edwards, says a seven-day NHS is a good aspiration.
But he argues the health service is in a world of "tough trade-offs", with many hospitals only managing to meet their current commitments by running up deficits.
He concludes the policy is likely to cost hundreds of millions of pounds, and suggests - in the current climate - there are better ways of spending the money.
In his column, he says: "NHS policy is largely made by middle-aged, middle-class men and women who commute long distances into London and Leeds."
Mr Edwards added: "I think one compelling priority would be to try and shorten the time that patients stay in hospital.
"A seven-day-service helps a little with that but actually this is more about investing in community services and getting the decision-processes in hospitals a lot slicker. And we could do that, probably, more easily".
He says there may also be benefits from focusing on individual conditions.
"Another area would be sepsis, which has a very large toll of mortality, probably much more significant than seems to be associated with seven-day working.
"Putting in some measures to spot that early and to intervene in a more effective way would have a big effect on people."
Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has defended the push for a seven-day NHS. He acknowledged there may be "upfront costs" of hundreds of millions of pounds, but he told the BBC there may also be similar levels of savings because of improved discharge from hospital.
He also argued the government was investing in other areas such as the new meningitis B vaccine, new cancer drugs and dementia.
And he insisted there was strong support in the health service for the seven-day plan.
"For doctors who are totally passionate that the NHS should offer the best and safest care anywhere in the world, the knowledge that thousands of people die every year because we don't offer the same level of service at weekend as we do in the weeks is something that really worries them."
The chief executive of the Sepsis Trust, Dr Ron Daniels, welcomed the proposed emphasis on tackling the problem, which kills an estimated 37,000 people every year in the UK.
"Reducing deaths from sepsis is not rocket science but there's been relatively little investment in dealing with the problem.
"A stronger approach to tackling sepsis would be the quickest win towards saving lives and would require much less investment than a move to full seven-day services in the NHS."

Article: The Belgium international, 24, changed the game from the bench but fell awkwardly in injury time.
His agent Patrick de Koster initially said De Bruyne would miss six weeks.
But, after seeing a specialist, the £55m former Wolfsburg player said: "I'll be out for around 10 weeks."
De Bruyne could miss up to 13 league and cup games, including the League Cup final with Liverpool on 28 February, both legs of the Champions League last-16 tie with Dynamo Kiev and the Manchester derby on 20 March.
The Belgian is City's second top goalscorer with 12 this season, four behind striker Sergio Aguero.
De Koster added: "Kevin told me the only thing he can do is work hard and come back. Kevin is sad. His dream is to always be playing football."
De Bruyne scored one goal and set up another to help City to a 4-3 aggregate victory over the Toffees.
Everton goalkeeper Joel Robles, who repeatedly tried to lift up De Bruyne as he lay injured, used social media to say sorry.

Article: It's a type of battery called lithium-sulphur, which - in theory - could have five times the energy density of the lithium-ion forms in wide use today.
But the prototype developed by a UK-Chinese team overcomes a key hurdle to their commercial development by taking inspiration from the gut.
Details appear in the journal Advanced Functional Materials.
Scientists are tackling the challenge of improving battery technology using a variety of different approaches; this is one of them.
One of the problems hindering the commercial development of lithium-sulphur-based devices has been the degradation of the batteries caused by the loss of active materials within.
To overcome this problem, the researchers developed a lightweight layer with nano-scale structure which resembles the villi - finger-like protrusions which line the small intestine.
In humans, villi are used to absorb the products of digestion and increase the surface area across which this process can take place.
In the new lithium-sulphur battery, a layer of material with a villi-like structure, made from tiny zinc oxide wires, is placed on the surface of one of the battery's electrodes.
This can trap fragments of the active material when they break off, keeping them accessible for ongoing reactions and allowing the material to be reused.
"It's a tiny thing, this layer, but it's important," said study co-author Dr Paul Coxon from the University of Cambridge's department of materials science and metallurgy.
"This gets us a long way through the bottleneck which is preventing the development of better batteries."
The researchers say that, if hurdles to commercial development can be overcome, lithium-sulphur batteries could have five times the energy density of the lithium-ion batteries used in smartphones and other electronics.
But as lithium-sulphur batteries discharge, sulphur molecules transform into chain-like structures known as poly-sulphides.
As the devices undergo several charge-discharge cycles, bits of the poly-sulphide go into the battery's electrolyte (the electrically-conducting solution), so that over time the battery loses active material.
"This is the first time a chemically functional layer with a well-organised nano-architecture has been proposed to trap and reuse the dissolved active materials during battery charging and discharging," said lead author Teng Zhao, a PhD student from Cambridge.
"By taking our inspiration from the natural world, we were able to come up with a solution that we hope will accelerate the development of next-generation batteries."
The device is currently a proof of principle; commercially-available lithium-sulphur batteries are still some years away.
Additionally, while the number of times the battery can be charged and discharged has been improved, it is still not able to go through as many charge cycles as a lithium-ion battery.
But the researchers point out that, given a lithium-sulphur battery does not need to be charged as often as a lithium-ion battery, it may be the case that the increase in energy density cancels out the lower total number of charge-discharge cycles.

Devon and Cornwall Police conducted a search of the area but have not found the drone or operator.
Insp Dave Meredith called it "an incredibly concerning incident".
Latest on the drone near miss, and other stories from Devon and Cornwall
"The close proximity of the drone to the passenger aircraft shows a complete disregard by the operator for public safety and we are appealing to the public for information to help us track down this reckless drone operator," Insp Meredith said.
A spokeswoman for Cornwall Airport Newquay confirmed a drone had flown within the air traffic zone adjacent to the final approach to the airport as the plane flew in from London Stansted carrying 62 passengers.
"Although on this occasion there was no danger of collision, Air Traffic Control (ATC) reported this incident to the police as the drone should not have been flown in that area without ATC clearance and posed a potential danger to incoming flights," she said.
A spokesperson for the UK Civil Aviation Authority said: "Airspace proximity incidents, whether involving two aircraft, or a drone and an aircraft, need to be fully investigated to establish the level of risk involved."
The UK Airprox Board, which investigates airspace proximity incidents, said it had not received any official report of the incident yet.
Flybe said it would "work closely" with all relevant authorities to help identify the perpetrators of any activity which could jeopardise passenger safety.
Operators of any small unmanned surveillance aircraft must not fly them within 50m (164 ft) of any vessel, vehicle or structure which is not under the user's control, unless they have obtained permission from the Civil Aviation Authority, according to the Air Navigation Order 2009.

He added: "He was so large and heavy it took three of our officers to lift him and take him to our centre in Drumoak where we cut the net away.
"If he hadn't been discovered and freed the net would eventually have cut through his skin which could have resulted in septicaemia or other infections.
"Thankfully there were no injuries in this case and we were able to release him relatively quickly.
"This was a very happy ending and we're so glad we were able to help."

Article: Cuadrilla, the firm behind the tests, said drilling had been suspended as a precaution after the 1.5 magnitude tremor - the second in two months.
It will now examine the data collected by the British Geological Survey (BGS) before deciding whether to resume.
A tremor centred on Poulton-le-Fylde on 1 April shared a "similar location and mechanism", the BSG said.
Shale gas drilling, known as "fracking", involves shattering hard shale rocks underground to release gas using either hydraulic pressure or tiny explosions.
Mark Miller, chief executive of Cuadrilla Resources, said: "We take our responsibilities very seriously and that is why we have stopped fracking operations to share information and consult with the relevant authorities and other experts.
"We expect that this analysis and subsequent consultation will take a number of weeks to conclude and we will decide on appropriate actions after that."
The process has proved controversial in the US with environmentalists alleging that shale gas leaking into their drinking supply could cause tap water to ignite.
But earlier this month the Commons energy select committee called on ministers to support the process in the UK arguing that environmental problems associated with it in the US could be overcome by tight regulation and good industry practice.
The BGS said it was also monitoring fracking as a precaution. There have been two small earthquakes in Lancashire since fracking began in the county in March, including the latest on Friday.
In an analysis of the April quake published on its website the BGS said: "Any process that injects pressurised water into rocks at depth will cause the rock to fracture and possibly produce earthquakes.
"It is well known that injection of water or other fluids during the oil extraction and geothermal engineering, such as Shale gas, processes can result in earthquake activity."
The BGS said the April tremor took place 1.2 miles (2km) away from the drilling site but said its monitoring instruments were 50 miles (80km) away.
Speaking about the latest quake, Dr Brian Baptie, head of seismology at the BGS, said: "The earthquake was felt by at least one person in Poulton-Le-Fylde.
"Our analysis places the epicentre of the event to within 2km of the Preese Hall site.
"Data from two temporary instruments close to the drill site, installed after the magnitude 2.3 earthquake on 1 April, indicate that the event occurred at a depth of approximately 2km (1.2 miles).
"The recorded waveforms are very similar to those from the magnitude 2.3 event last month, which suggests that the two events share a similar location and mechanism."

Article: The archive of travel writer, war hero and adventurer Sir Patrick Leigh Fermor has been catalogued by the National Library of Scotland.
The collection includes letters from Prince Charles and Truman Capote.
Sir Patrick, who was known as Paddy, died in 2011 at the age of 96.
He published several books on his travels around the world and one of the most prized items in the archive is the only surviving notebook from his 1933 trek across Europe.
The trek provided the material for his most famous books, 'A Time of Gifts', 'Between the Woods and the Water' and 'The Broken Road'.
Thousands of items which occupy 16 metres of shelving took a year to be catalogued by library staff.
Along with letters from notable 20th century figures they also uncovered literary manuscripts, sketches and what appears to be an unpublished John Betjeman poem on the back of an envelope.
Sir Patrick spent much of World War Two on Nazi-occupied Crete. During his time there he disguised himself as a shepherd to organise guerrilla operations against the Nazis. He led one of the most daring feats of the war in 1944, capturing the commander of the German garrison on Crete.
The 1957 film starring Dirk Bogarde 'Ill Met by Moonlight' was based on the operation.
Graham Stewart, the library curator who worked on the archive project, said: "It is a history of the colourful life of a celebrated writer. He was undoubtedly a superstar of his day and his books have, if anything, grown in popularity over the years.
"There has already been a lot of interest in the archive and we expect this to increase now among Leigh Fermor fans and people interested in the 20th century more generally."
The library is working on digitising some of the archive so it can be viewed on its website. They are also considering holding exhibitions and displays of the collection so more people will be able to see it.
The archive was given to the library by the John R Murray Charitable Trust. John Murray was Sir Patrick's publisher and the trust also supported the cataloguing of the collection.

Article: Staffordshire bull terrier Ziggy was found in remote woodland near Wansford in Peterborough on Wednesday morning.
X-rays showed the weapon had just missed his skull and vital organs.
RSPCA Insp Justin Stubbs helped a vet "slowly, slowly pull the bolt out" of the sedated dog. "It was a heart in the mouth moment but Ziggy is making a fantastic recovery," he said.
The two-year-old dog had been deliberately shot. It was "a very intentional shot at very close range", the RSPCA said.
It is thought Ziggy only survived by moving his head "at the right time".
An examination of his injuries showed Ziggy had been roaming the woods for a few days, "terrified and in complete agony", before being found by two walkers.
Despite having a 50cm (20ins) carbon fibre bolt embedded from one side of his head to the other, Ziggy was still wagging his tail and wanting people to make a fuss of him, Mr Stubbs said.
However, the vet was faced with the task of removing the weapon.
"It had missed Ziggy's brain, ears, eyes and skull bone by millimetres, but X-rays don't show up major blood vessels," Mr Stubbs said.
"It really was a heart in the mouth moment and hoping for the best, but we had everything in place in case anything happened."
When the bolt was slowly inched out, Mr Stubbs, the vet and a nurse realised it had not hit any blood vessels.
"I don't think anyone took a breath for about a minute. Then there was a collective sigh of relief," Mr Stubbs said.
"It had just gone through soft tissue and didn't even hit muscle."
Ziggy is now being looked after at nearby kennels where he is said to be making "a miraculous recovery".
"He is bounding around as if nothing happened," Mr Stubbs said.
"If ever a dog had a guardian angel, Ziggy had one that day."
The RSPCA is continuing to investigate and has appealed for information about the attack.

The delicate operation to remove a crossbow bolt embedded in a dog's head took "just one minute", the RSPCA said.

The union is the third largest in the UK with more than 600,000 members.
Current general secretary Paul Kenny announced in the summer he was standing down after almost a decade in the job.
Mr Roache has 35 years experience at the GMB and led the Leeds City Council 13-week refuse and street cleaning strike in 2009 - the longest in the union's history.
He said he was "proud and humbled" to have been elected.
"I will repay GMB members' faith in me by leading a 21st Century union that fights for our members, their families and communities, every hour of every day."
Mr Roache also paid tribute to Mr Kenny for his work "that has made GMB the envy of the union movement".
Details of the handover date have yet to be agreed.

Article: The Grade II-listed Drummond Mill on Lumb Lane in Manningham was ravaged by a fire which started in the basement on Thursday.
The building has now been partially demolished to prevent further collapse.
Historic England said West Yorkshire's mills are "important landmarks which need to be cherished".
The organisation, which preserves and lists historic buildings, is currently part-way through a review into West Yorkshire's mills to establish best practice for future redevelopments.
Spokesperson Deborah Wall said: "The community is deeply affected and emotional about the loss of this historic building.
"It just shows how important these landmarks are to people and why the work to find ways to capture the stories of these places and to cherish them is so important."
Last month, property consultants Cushman and Wakefield began work with architects and Historic England to examine ways in which West Yorkshire's vacant textile mills could be brought back into use.
Trevor Mitchell, Historic England's planning director for Yorkshire, said: "West Yorkshire's textile mills are iconic buildings that people care deeply about.
"Some have been brilliantly and creatively converted into places to work, live or socialise.
"We are working to understand how these successful conversions have been achieved and try to find solutions for those mills that need a new purpose to become great landmarks in our region again."
Successful redevelopments include Tower Works and Marshalls in Leeds, Sunny Bank Mills in Pudsey, Lister Mills in Bradford, Salts Mill in Saltaire, Red Brick Mill in Batley, and Dean Clough in Halifax.
Yorkshire has 172 listed textile mills.
Ms Wall said the future of Drummond Mill was "totally uncertain" until Bradford Council and the fire service had determined the full extent of the damage.

Article: "There's a lot going on right now,"  the singer tells us. And she's not wrong.
The follow-up to her Mercury Prize-nominated debut, 2013's Sing To The Moon, is imminent. Second album The Dreaming Room is due in June and her newest track Phenomenal Woman has just debuted as Annie Mac's hottest record on BBC Radio 1.
"And then we have probably the most important live moment on TV in this country today," she adds.
"It's all potentially extremely exciting - and that just means that I'm naturally terrified."
The singer's struggles with stage fright and anxiety are well-documented and live TV is a particular fear.
Describing the concept as "just hellish", she tells us: "I'd rather die. That's how I feel sometimes - I think, 'if I dropped dead I wouldn't have to do it!'."
So, it's perhaps surprising that the singer let us tag along as she kicked off the new series of Later... with Jools Holland. But it seems BBC Two's esteemed music show has a special place in her heart.
"In the musician's world, you say 'Jools Holland' and all of a sudden you've got massive respect - it's like saying you got Glastonbury."
Her third time on Later... she calls respected musician and presenter Holland a "genuine champion".
"He called me this afternoon just to say that he'd been listening to my new record and he wanted to tell me specifically what song and what parts and why.
"I tell you, in the TV world, it's not the kind of place where there's room for those kind of genuine interactions, just because there's so much pressure on everyone. It's very special."
Here the diary of Laura's day.
Tour manager Paul picks us up in sunny east London. Laura's assistant Mariama is laden with popcorn and snacks as we pile into the silver Mercedes van bound for the studios in Kent. The singer takes some me-time behind her shades, safe in the knowledge it's going to be a long day.
"I'm such a weird person to be around before anything big," she admits.
"I can't normally talk, so my team tend to just leave me to it, but I'll pick up.
"Right now I want to be jumping up, but you don't want to celebrate before the main event, so I'm just trying to be as relaxed as I can."
We arrive to the sounds of Kano and his brass section sound-checking. He's on the bill along with Paul Simon, The Coral, Jason Isbell and Lake Street Dive.
Laura has the honour of opening and closing both the live and pre-recorded shows, something she says she's "glad you only find out on the day".
"I'm doing Phenomenal Woman, Kiss My Feet - which the Jools team requested - and Overcome, the first single, which featured Nile Rogers.
"I wanted to explode back onto the scene with something that was captivating in a much rawer and darker way. That's why there's dance and so much movement this time around, and why it's such a visual album."
Backstage the band are split across two dressing rooms - one for the boys and one for the girls, where we're quickly made welcome as they debate which of the many black items of clothing they've brought will get worn.
"There's nine of us - it's huge by pop terms, but I refused to compromise," says Laura.
"With Sing To The Moon, six of us were trying to sound like an orchestra and a choir. It was a stress.
"My sister Dionne went from violin to guitar - literally learnt the guitar [and] is killing it - my brother's playing cello. It feels much more like a band than me trying to do the solo artist thing. We feel like a really solid family."
Still in her fur-lined boots and denim dress from the journey, Laura and the band head to the camera rehearsal. Jools arrives and gives Laura a hug, waving hello to the production team. Giant white cue cards are being written to help him introduce the acts.
Running through each of their tracks twice, Laura sports her new keytar in place of her trademark piano.
"Lady Mariama was up until 4am trying to make my keytar white. I mean what the hell is that about?" she laughs.
"Initially it was a joke idea, I was just messing about jamming with it, but it made so much sense. I'm not stuck behind anything in a static way anymore, I can move and I can see people. If I want to turn and feel the band I can do that. We have such a good time now."
Time for some nourishment. The team ("there's like millions of them... making it work") are handed pocket money for the canteen, while Laura retreats to her dressing room. As well as make-up, wardrobe and calming those nerves, she also has a TV interview to fit in.
"I used to not eat, I couldn't eat. But I've learned to, so you don't drop off after one song. I have meatballs and sweet potato fries. And a balance of water and red wine."
"[Designer] Alex Noble has done a lot of my clothes recently," says Laura. "He is just on another planet. He text me yesterday and I was just weeping emojis because the clothes are just... I mean you'll see with the outfit tonight.
"I made a visual essay for the album, this massive book [filled with] images, as stimulus for new music but also to help anybody I might be collaborating with. Stylists or people in the label, anyone could take the book and go 'oh yeah, I'm listening and I'm looking'.
"It means I get to talk less. That's probably surprising to some people because I do love to natter! But it helps."
Minutes before show time, Laura's designer and assistant are still huddled together in one of the dressing rooms with a needle and thread and the singer's fabulous outfit in their hands.
She's set to do an interview at Jools's famous piano, but the purple corset she'll be wearing (with matching super-flared trousers) will be too tight to sit down in. Cue furious unpicking and re-stitching. Eventually it's decided she'll do the interview standing up. Problem solved.
With the audience in place and schooled on how to cheer and clap in the correct manner, Laura's up first - opening the pre-recorded show with Maya Angelou-inspired anthem Phenomenal Woman.
"If you're first out of the blocks - you're the thing in the room that makes the first sound. I've been second and third before and everybody breathes when the sound's been made," says Laura.
There's mild panic when the lighting desk freezes after The Coral perform, but after a few minutes of confusion they're rolling again.
Later, a respectful hush descends as Paul Simon performs Sounds Of Silence in the centre of the studio.
"He made me cry so much," says Laura. "I kept thinking, 'why didn't I bring Mum to this gig?'. She was raised on Simon and Garfunkel.
"I ended up thinking about my whole life, my creative life... what is this all about? Here I am literally stood in front of Mr Paul Simon."
With all the stars limbered up (and the shortest of toilet breaks), the second show goes live on BBC Two.
"It's an amazing feeling because you know that it's happening now and everybody's tuned in, but at the same time - the fear and the dread. You can't correct anything, so whatever comes out is it. "
Laura ends the live show on a high with Phenomenal Woman.
"That for me was surprisingly wonderful, because live television literally - there's nothing that I'm more terrified of! And the live performance was better than the pre-record - what?!"
It's all over. The audience files out and the set's dismantled as artists and their teams pack up their gear and rush to congratulate each other.
US outfit Lake Street Dive collar Laura for a picture, while she and sister Dionne seek out Kano for a snap ("Because he's fine. And obviously amazing").
"I always forget how emotionally exhausting it is," says Laura.
"The amount I invest into any performance is always bucket loads of sweat or tension that doesn't get released until I'm in that moment.
"That's the uniqueness of a show like Jools's - you are getting that concentrated performance."
So what now?
"Everybody laughs at me because I literally make a beeline for my bed after. I'll probably eat again later because I always get a major appetite, which is why I have this thing [grabs belly area] that will never go away.
"But yeah, I just conk out. If I think about stuff I'll go nuts, because you've just put something out.
"I mean I haven't had a child, but I imagine - like when you have a baby - it's out there. I can't push it back in!"

Article: Tunisia had faced expulsion from the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations until apologising to Caf for complaints it lodged against the organisation during this year's Nations Cup.
Morocco, meanwhile, were only able to enter the 2017 Nations Cup qualifying draw after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) overturned a ban on its participation.
We are preparing for a future full of good things for both Africa and Morocco
"We are preparing for a future full of good things for both Africa and Morocco," said Moroccan FA chief Fouzi Lekjaa.
"We are back after a little break of a few months, but it has not had a big impact. The impact was minimal and we were, along with our Caf colleagues, able to make it pass."
Morocco were punished in February after being replaced as 2015 Nations Cup hosts last November, just two months before the competition began.
The North Africans refused to stage the tournament in January 2015, citing fears over importing the Ebola virus, and asked for a postponement of either six or twelve months instead.
Earlier this month, Cas overturned Caf's ruling and reduced a fine imposed on Morocco's FA from $1m (£675,000) to $50,000 (£34,000).
Equatorial Guinea stepped in to stage the 2015 finals, despite having just 64 days to prepare.
The host nation was also at the centre of the incident that led to Tunisia's row with Caf, which the local federation (FTF) says is now over.
"I am convinced that the page has been turned and that there will no longer by any problems," FTF vice-president Maher Snoussi told BBC Sport.
Seeking their first Nations Cup triumph since 2004, the Tunisians were leading 1-0 in the 90th minute of their quarter-final against the hosts when they were awarded a highly contentious penalty.
The spot-kick was converted and Equatorial Guinea went on to win 2-1 in extra-time, as the Tunisian players and bench largely lost their heads as tempers flared.
The Tunisians wrote a furious letter to Caf in response, which prompted African football's ruling body to demand an apology by 31 March 2015 or face disqualification from the next Nations Cup.
Contrary to media reports, the Tunisia Football Federation insists it never accused Caf nor Mauritian referee Rajindraparsad Seechurn of corruption.
"We never spoke of corruption because we had no evidence," said Snoussi.
"But we were strongly convinced that the referee sought out an unjustifiable penalty, and that perhaps he was influenced by the atmosphere inside the stadium."
"But we never accused either him or any Caf member of corruption. "We simply said the referee was very badly chosen and we contested that a 45-year-old, coming towards the end of his international career, should have been selected.
"In our famous letter, we said that the commission in charge of appointing referees had to assume responsibility for appointing a referee incapable of handling the match."
Tunisia's 2017 participation seemed in doubt until a meeting with Caf president Issa Hayatou and others in Senegal in mid-March led to a rapprochement.
"Luckily, with the strong pressure of Issa Hayatou, with whom I had a meeting in Dakar where we discussed our difference, we've managed to turn the page," said Snoussi.
"We are very happy to be playing the (2017) Nations Cup and I feel this difference has been now completely ironed out."
Following last week's draw in Cairo, Tunisia will face Togo, Liberia and Djibouti in Group A while Morocco will Cape Verde, Libya and Sao Tome in Group F.
Should the Tunisians reach the 2017 finals in Gabon, they will reach their thirteenth straight Nations Cup - which would be a record.

Tunisia and Morocco's differences with the Confederation of African Football (Caf) are in the past, both North African nations say.

In an interview with Football Focus, the Argentine, 31, revealed the shock of his diagnosis last year and the subsequent support from his team-mates.
"It was really emotional to be back," he said. "I feel born again and like I'm enjoying things for the first time.
"Of course, now I want to prove I can still be a Premier League player."
Gutierrez had an operation to remove his left testicle in September 2014 after the discovery of a tumour, before undergoing chemotherapy.
He made his return to the Newcastle first team for the 1-0 defeat by Manchester United on 4 March as a substitute.
Gutierrez, who joined the Magpies from Real Mallorca in July 2008, is out of contract in the summer but is just focused on playing regularly again for the time being.
"I know my situation here is a little tricky," he said. "The one thing I can do is work hard and do my best.
"I want to stay in England and I love the Premier League, but I don't know about the future.
"At present, I am with Newcastle and have two months to finish the season. When the season finishes, I start thinking about the future."
The full interview with Jonas Gutierrez can be seen on Saturday's Football Focus at 1130 (GMT) and below are some of the highlights.
"When they told me I had cancer, it was a shock. I remember I was with the Newcastle doctor and I started crying," said Gutierrez.
"I went to my house to speak to my dad and he thought I was making a joke with him. He didn't realise and believe what I was telling him."
He added: "Chemotherapy is a hard treatment. I was just thinking after each session it was a day less I had to recover.
"I received a lot of support. To be back and train, do what you love, is another thing that makes you recover quickly."
"It was really emotional to be back. It was good to have a first step a few days before against Aston Villa and be on the bench," said Gutierrez.
"When I came on against United, I could just focus on the game. It was unbelievable and to get the armband was a great touch.
"Now I want to fight for my place. What is in my head is to work hard, do all I can to get minutes on the pitch."
"When the doctor told me I was recovering, I wanted to make a new tattoo," Gutierrez added.
"I love Eminem, so I put part of a song on my arm and I put the date. It says: 'I am alive again, more alive than I have been in my whole entire life.'"

Article: My move has set me thinking about the future of business news.  There are two words that sum that up: global and digital.
First let us consider global. Businesses are increasingly organised so that their supply chains and markets extend across national borders. This means that events which happen in one part of the world can have important effects on businesses everywhere.
So, it is vital for business journalists to steer away from closed-economy thinking. Understanding and explaining the connections between consumers, producers, and policymakers in different countries is now essential to covering the beat.
Second, we are in the midst of a digital revolution when it comes to the way news is reported and delivered to audiences. I am not predicting that the end of TV and radio listings is right around the corner, but viewers increasingly want to watch and listen at a time when they want to.
I found this with my own programme, Talking Business with Linda Yueh, where many UK viewers watched via BBC iPlayer. Outside the UK, where the BBC's on demand service was not available, the programme had multiple showings through the week.
It is inevitable that this trend will continue. The challenge for business reporting in the digital age, though, goes beyond simply making content more easily available online to suit viewer habits.
The prevalence of social media and the internet combined with smart phones mean that people have a huge amount of information available at their fingertips. News audiences are now more informed than ever before, especially in business. When news is reported in mainstream media, for many it is no longer new.  Personally, I often find news items from social media and other online sources faster than traditional ones.
Therefore, business news should look to add value for its audience in terms of relevant and rigorous analysis rather than just the reporting of events. It should be a trusted source among the many sources of information from which the viewer can choose.
Being global and digital are what I have tried to achieve in the last two years.
This may be my last blog here. But look for my posts elsewhere on the BBC website as I will continue to pen pieces that accompany programmes as a freelance presenter.
And readers of this blog know that I will always alert them to a new post via social media.

Article: The club, which is owned by its fans via the Exeter City Supporters Trust, declared a total profit of £1.642m for 2014-15, mainly due to the sale of midfielder Matt Grimes to Swansea City.
The deal in January 2015 for £1.75m, was a record sale for the club.
The profits came in the same year that the club were forced to get an emergency loan to pay players' wages.
In June 2014 cashflow problems meant the Professional Footballers' Association stepped in to pay the players and forced Exeter into a transfer embargo which was only lifted in August of that year.
The club's accounts also show that Exeter had a surplus of shareholders' funds of £761,000, compared to a deficit of £880,000 the previous year and reduced their cost base by almost 5%.
Exeter are hoping to redevelop St James Park after being given planning permission last month.
"The board have agreed in broad terms how the income from the transfer should be spent to improve the infrastructure strength of the club in line with its vision and underlying model and these plans are now being developed in detail for further presentation," said a club statement.

Article: A 5ft x 3ft (1.5m x 1m) void appeared on Whitworth Street on Sunday, resulting in the road's closure between Princess Street and Oxford Street.
A section of the busy Mancunian Way has been closed since August, after two holes opened up. Replacement sewer pipes are being installed.
United Utilities said sewers underneath Whitworth Street have not been damaged.
"Non-urgent" roadworks in other parts of the city have been suspended until after Christmas in order to relieve congestion caused by Mancunian Way's partial closure.
Councillor Pat Karney, city centre lead for Manchester City Council, said Whitworth Street should be repaired in time for Monday's evening rush hour.
He described the appearance of the latest hole as "incredibly unfortunate".
"The council has placed a moratorium on all non-urgent roadworks, but this is the last thing we needed at the moment," he added.
He said the council will investigate why the city is being "blighted" by holes.

Majid Rashed, vice president of the UAE International Paralympic Committee, confirmed "the throwing cage collapsed on the athlete's head".
Hayayei, 36, was pronounced dead at the scene at 17:20 BST on Tuesday.
The Health and Safety Executive and police are investigating the incident, which was witnessed by some of Hayayei's team-mates and UAE staff.
"I can say the throwing cage collapsed on the athlete's head - but how that happened, we can not say," Rashed said on Wednesday.

The IPC said two of the athlete's personal coaches were present but were not involved.
Hayayei, a father of five, was preparing to compete in the F34 class at the Championships.
"He was ambitious, he wanted to win medals for his country and for his family. He had a lot of dreams within the para-sports movement, " Rashed said, adding that the UAE team will still compete in London.
"The athletes were very close to Abdullah, they trained in the same centre in the UAE. It's really very difficult for all of us but we promised ourselves that we are going to continue and we are going to win something for Abdullah, bringing the best performance from the athletes.
"We are working with the athletes to get them in a better situation, obviously today will be better than yesterday, tomorrow we believe will be even better for them."
The Metropolitan Police said emergency services "were called shortly after 17:00hrs on Tuesday... to reports of a seriously injured man at Newham Leisure Centre".

Article: Syrian state media says toxic gas was contained in shells that rebels have been firing at government-held areas in the divided city.
Russian news agency Interfax says seven people died and more than 20 were hospitalised after Tuesday's attack.
There has been no independent confirmation of the claim.
It comes after reports from a rebel-held town in Idlib province that chlorine gas was dropped on it late on Monday after a Russian military helicopter had earlier been shot down nearby.
A battle has continued since the weekend in Aleppo, as rebels attempt to break a government siege of a rebel-controlled area.
It is expected to be decisive for the future of a city that was once a commercial heartland but has been destroyed by five years of war.
About a quarter of a million civilians are living under siege since government forces cut them off last month.
The latest reports from the area are that the government, backed by Russian jets, has regained some ground. It is not clear exactly which territory has returned to government control but a reporter for a Beirut-based TV station said the army had regained control of two out of three villages that it lost near Aleppo earlier this week.
Russian and Syrian forces say they have been operating seven so-called humanitarian corridors, allowing hundreds of people to leave the besieged area peacefully.
On Wednesday, Russian state television ran pictures of civilians and fighters leaving. Smoke was seen billowing over the city in the footage, and gunshots were heard.
The UN's Children's Fund (Unicef) said it is "extremely" concerned for the safety of children caught up in violence in the city.
Saad Houry, of the fund, said children make up a third of the population trapped in the siege, and called for unhindered humanitarian access and for children to be protected.
The New York-based Physicians for Human Rights group said the last week of July was the worst week for attacks on medical facilities in the region since the Syrian war began in 2011. In a statement, the group said it has verified six deadly air strikes against hospitals in Aleppo governorate, all perpetrated by Syrian government forces.
Widney Brown of Physicians for Human Rights said: "Destroying hospitals is tantamount to signing thousands of death warrants for people now stranded in eastern Aleppo."

The Russian military says it has informed the US that it believes rebels in the Syrian city of Aleppo have deployed "toxic substances".

Article: The end of last year saw growth across several sectors of the economy, but there are concerns about rising prices, skill shortages and falling sales.
Manufacturers reported their highest growth in new orders for nearly three years, with export demand still strong.
In retail, there was also a return to optimism - though only just, and despite profitability being squeezed.
In tourism, firms reported improving visitor numbers in the final quarter of the year, but falling sales revenues.
Responses to the survey, carried out for the Chambers of Commerce by Strathclyde University economists at the Fraser of Allander Institute, were more positive than the economic figures published on Wednesday.
The Labour Force Survey and the Gross Domestic Product figures showed weakness in the Scottish economy, while covering an earlier part of 2016 than the Chambers' survey.
While the GDP assessment from the Scottish government has seen a sharp contraction in the past year, the Chambers found a more positive picture, with growth in private commercial contracts.
However, there are warning signals survey, with tourism companies having difficulties in finding skilled recruits. Retail firms flagged up rising prices. Construction is expecting an investment dip.
The weakest of the five sectors covered was finance and business services. More firms in that large part of the economy saw employment fall than saw it rise. But on balance, firms say sales revenue is expected to increase.
Neil Amner, chairman of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce economic advisory group, said: "Our latest economic data shows that many Scottish businesses will have a successful 2017, with business optimism remaining positive for many sectors.
"This is good news for the economy, particularly as we continue to deal with international uncertainty and domestic issues including a rating revaluation and a potential divergence of Income Tax between Scotland and the rest of the UK.
"The overall business mood remains positive but firms expect business growth to be challenged by rising prices, tightening of cash flow and profitability, higher import costs impacted by exchange rates and a likely increase of inflation as the year goes on.
"On the converse side, exporters are continuing to report a healthy growth in trade, though perhaps not quite matching up to their initial expectations.
"Optimism could hardly be more finely balanced and anything that rocks the boat could change the glass from half full to half empty.
"Business success in 2017 will largely depend upon the ability of firms to manage costs and for consumer demand to remain strong in the face of pressures to real incomes."

Article: "I am seriously considering emigrating to Australia, Jamaica or the US," says Faye Jones.
The 32-year-old PA from Wokingham jumps every time there's a knock at the door and tiptoes around neighbours who might call the police.
Her crime? Five years ago, Faye was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and after suffering from the side effects of prescribed drugs, she now uses cannabis to ease her pain, nausea and inflammation.
In the UK, where cannabis is a Class B drug, police can issue warnings or on-the-spot fines for possession of a small amount, while courts can impose sentences of up to five years for possession of larger amounts and up to 14 years for those who supply or produce it.
Faye - a campaigner for United Patients Alliance (UPA), which is calling for cannabis to be legally accessed by patients - has a raft of places she could start a new life.
Medicinal cannabis is legal - or being legalised - in 25 US states, and in countries from Canada to Italy.
"But I'd rather not leave the country I was born in," she says. "Mum would be devastated."
Perhaps now she won't have to. A group of MPs has called on the government to legalise medical cannabis after publishing the results of a seven-month inquiry into medicinal use of the drug.
The All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Drug Policy Reform took evidence from 623 patients, professionals and experts and more than 20,000 scientific and medical reports were reviewed.
"The results are clear. Cannabis has a medical benefit for a wide range of conditions," says Mike Barnes, a professor of neurological rehabilitation.
However, the NHS warns that cannabis use carries a number of risks, such as impairing the ability to drive, as well as causing harm to lungs if smoked and harm to mental health, fertility or unborn babies.
It can also have other serious consequences, with users potentially vulnerable to developing psychotic illnesses, the Royal College of Psychiatrists says.
A Home Office spokesman said the government had no plan to legalise cannabis, adding: "There is a substantial body of scientific and medical evidence to show that cannabis is a harmful drug which can damage people's mental and physical health."
Yet the End Our Pain campaign, which supports the legalisation of medical cannabis, estimates that one million people across the UK rely on the drug for medical reasons.
By Michelle Roberts, health editor, BBC News online
After weighing the evidence, experts say there is a clear therapeutic role for medical cannabis.
There is good evidence that it helps alleviate the symptoms of chronic pain, MS and nausea associated with chemotherapy, as well as anxiety.
But for treating other conditions, such as depression, headaches and epilepsy, there is limited or no convincing evidence that it works.
Like any drug, cannabis can cause side effects.
Smoking cannabis in a joint rolled with tobacco can make asthma worse and probably increases the risk of lung cancer.
Regular cannabis use puts some people at increased risk of psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia, and can also reduce fertility.
Cannabis is addictive and you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as cravings, difficulty sleeping, sweating and shaking.
Cannabis affects how the brain works. It can make users feel very anxious and even paranoid, it can make it difficult to concentrate and learn.

The United Patients Alliance says 30% of cannabis patients surveyed by the APPG cited depression as a reason for self-medication - though patients reported multiple conditions and depression often accompanies other primary conditions.
About a quarter of patients said they used the drug to combat anxiety and a quarter mentioned pain.
Almost 70% of the patients surveyed said they had tried conventional medicines first, before turning to cannabis.
Doctors told Faye she would have to take low dosages of cancer drugs for the rest of her life to deal with her rheumatoid arthritis.
But after suffering hair loss, frequent sickness and "brain fog", her job became untenable and her boss took her aside.
"I'd just bought a house and had a mortgage - I couldn't afford to lose my job," she says.
Inspired by MS patients, she tried cannabis and now spends about £250 a month making her own capsules and creams, mixing cannabis oil and coconut oil.
Faye says she takes the pills "like I would ibuprofen, when I need them", claiming that the low dosage is not enough to make her high.
Along with 38% of users surveyed by the APPG, she also uses a vaporiser to consume the drug.
Fewer than a third smoke it with tobacco; one in five smokes it without tobacco. Others eat it, take capsules or use creams.
MS patient Penny Fitzlyon, from London, said she was prescribed a variety of opiates which "switched off all interest in the outside world".
She said they left her "feeling grotty and miserable", took away her sense of humour and made her constipated.
"Then after a second MRI scan, I overheard a nurse saying it wouldn't be long before I'd be in a wheelchair," she says. "So I started doing my own research. Cannabis was the only thing I could find that hadn't killed anyone."
Penny, 52, says she tracked down a herbalist who, unlike street sellers, knew how to mix different strains of cannabis for different patients.
"We want to get rid of street dealers," she says. "Backstreet cannabis is not good - they mix it with sand or glass to make it look all sparkly and heavy."
Some 72% of cannabis bought for medicinal use is purchased on the street or from friends, but 20% of users grow their own, in groups or by themselves. The remainder is sourced on the internet or abroad, according to those surveyed by the APPG.
Penny, who has been cautioned by the police twice, estimates that she spends £5,000 a year on cannabis - a fraction of the £30,000 annual cost of MS prescription drugs, she says.
Though she avoids "getting stoned", without small doses of the drug Penny finds simple tasks such as walking to the shops "incredibly painful".
For Jon Liebling, from Reading, brushes with the law have only made him more determined to fight for the right to use cannabis as a medicine.
A traumatic childhood, with a mother who attempted suicide and an absent father, left Jon anxious, depressed and struggling to concentrate at school. But after trying cannabis at university, he didn't look back.
"I knew it was illegal", he says, "But it just worked. All the pain and stress I'd carried in my back, shoulders and neck for years just went."
But the 48-year-old's use of cannabis would see him arrested by the police three times - forcing him to leave university, drop out of a nurses' training course and finally land him in court for growing his own.
Though the arrests led to no more than a slap on the wrist and a fine, he said they left him feeling "angry and disenfranchised".
"My life has been ruined by the law," he says. Now, as political director of the UPA, Jon says the conclusions of the parliamentary group are "incredibly exciting".
"I don't think judges really want to put people away for it," he says. "I was really honest with the judge about my medical history and he was really sympathetic."
Though Faye fears the police "taking away her medicine" or indeed sending her to prison, she says most people are "very understanding" - even potential employers.
She says she has mentioned her End Our Pain campaigning in numerous job interviews "and it never stopped me getting a second interview".
"I'm cannabis proud," she says.

Cannabis should be legalised for medical use, a cross-party group of MPs has said, but there are thousands of people already using the Class B drug for this purpose.

Article: The proceedings in London will be "the first time that undercover policing has been exposed to the rigour of public examination," he told a court.
Helen Steel, who had a relationship with an undercover officer, said police committed "human rights abuses".
But police said undercover officers can play an important role.
Lawyers investigating allegations for the Home Office say they have uncovered more than 80 possible miscarriages of justice relating to undercover policing.
Investigations revealed officers had also had relationships with women while undercover, and had used the names of dead children.
Undercover: The allegations made to date
Opening proceedings at the Royal Courts of Justice, Lord Justice Pitchford said: "It seems likely that the inquiry will expose both creditable and discreditable conduct, practice and management.
"At the conclusion of its investigation, the inquiry will report to the home secretary and make recommendations as to the deployment of undercover police officers in future."
"Jacqui", who had a son with a man she thought was a fellow animal rights activist, did not discover he was an undercover police officer until 25 years after he disappeared from her life.
She told the BBC the discovery was "like an earthquake".
"I want this inquiry to really get to the truth... and come to some conclusion about whether this money and human misery was worth it".
She wants the officers themselves to have the chance to give evidence, perhaps anonymously, "and not have to worry about the Official Secrets Act or what's going to happen to them".
She hopes "what happened to me... what happened to other women, will never happen again.
"There is no circumstance where having sexual relations in order to get information on a group, whatever the group is, is ever justified."
The home secretary ordered the review after claims police spied on the family of Stephen Lawrence.
Neville Lawrence, Stephen's father, said more than one judge should oversee the case, or its conclusions should be left to a jury.
"You have an old saying - two heads are better than one," he said. "Sometimes one person might miss something and the other one can bring them back to where they're supposed to be".
And Ms Steel said: "These undercover policing units have committed grievous human rights abuses which are absolutely shocking in a supposedly democratic society. We want to make sure they don't happen again to anybody else, and for that to happen we need the full truth to emerge."
Case study
"Alison" was a member of an independent political group in London in the 1990s when she formed a relationship with a man she knew as Mark Cassidy. They were together for five years and lived together for four.
But Mark disappeared suddenly, saying he'd had a row with his mother and was depressed.
"His disappearance five years after we met was very sudden and unexpected and didn't make sense. I spent a long time trying to find out where he was and why he'd left," Alison told Radio 4's Today programme.
She believes claims of depression were part of an "exit strategy" used by officers.
"I knew I had to get on with my life and I did that, but still carried on looking and searching when I could," she added.
She later found out "Mark" had a wife and children.
"I've carried on with my life, I've met somebody else who I grew up with as a child which was the only reason I was able to trust them was because I knew that they were who they said they were.
"And I've been fortunate enough to have a family, but many of the women who this has happened to have not been so fortunate."
Lord Justice Pitchford's inquiry at the Royal Courts of Justice will look into police infiltration of political and social justice groups in England and Wales since 1968.
The inquiry is expected to be split into three parts: establishing what happened, examining the procedures adopted by police to prevent wrongdoing, and recommendations for the future.
Preliminary hearings are due to start in the autumn and the inquiry is set to last three years.
The inquiry's terms of reference include:
The allegations were first widely reported in 2011 when a former undercover officer, Mark Kennedy, offered to help defend, in court, six environmental campaigners whom he had infiltrated.
That trial collapsed - and later the same year, there were further revelations of undercover relationships, one of which led to a child.
By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent
The allegations of wrongdoing by undercover police officers that have emerged since 2011 have been extraordinary.
That steady stream of stories has led to the launch of a major public inquiry into their activities.
The breadth and nature of what is being alleged is almost too big to grasp, but it fundamentally comes down to a simple question of whether elements of the police were out of control.
Seven key issues the inquiry will examine.
Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said undercover policing was an important tactic, but had to be done legally.
He told BBC London: "We, for the police, will make the case that our undercover officers are incredibly brave and they deal with some very dangerous people.
"We think this is a vital part of our toolset and if we don't have it then we don't suffer, but the public might.

The home owners and their dog escaped from the building after being alerted by a smoke alarm.
Scottish Fire and Rescue Service has launched an investigation into the cause of the blaze, although it is not believed to be suspicious.
Station manager Dave Wishart said: "Firefighters were deployed in strategic positions surrounding the building with high-pressure jets and worked through the night to bring the incident to a safe conclusion.
"Unfortunately the intensity of the fire meant the house was completely destroyed."
"The home owners became aware of the fire quickly and had a working smoke alarm.
"This helped them to get themselves and their dog out safely."

Article: The All Blacks were five points behind at half-time with a man in the sin-bin as four penalties from Handre Pollard cancelled out Jerome Kaino's early try.
A Dan Carter drop-goal and a Beauden Barrett try put the champions ahead.
South Africa replied with two penalties but a Carter effort in between secured victory despite ferocious Bok defence.
It was seldom pretty but once again in this World Cup there was a gripping finale, the All Blacks holding that two-point lead for the last 12 minutes as their opponents finally tired.
No team has ever retained the Webb Ellis trophy, but the All Blacks will be favourites to do so when they meet either Australia or Argentina next Saturday after finding their way through a brutal encounter.
This was nothing like the free-flowing attacking rugby that had eviscerated France in the quarter-finals, but in its own way it was just as admirable, as South Africa refused to buckle despite having just 43% possession.
The game swung in the 20 minutes after half-time, New Zealand beginning that period five points down and with Kaino off the pitch, but ending it five points up and with Springbok wing Bryan Habana in the sin-bin instead.
And despite replacement Pat Lambie cutting the lead to less than a score, the vast experience of the champions saw them through.
After Pollard's early penalty, the All Blacks struck back when Kaino thundered through De Jager down the right and touched down one-handed in the corner, but two more pin-point penalties from Pollard gave his side a two-point lead with 20 minutes gone.
South Africa were having significant success at the breakdown, New Zealand shipping six penalties in short order, and the world champions looked instead for territory, kicking behind the defence and into the corners.
Carter hit the post with a long-range penalty, and despite his side dominating possession and territory the Springbok defensive wall continued to hold.
When South Africa finally made it out of their half, they struck again. Kaino was sin-binned for kicking the ball away and Pollard stroked over his fourth penalty to make it 12-7 at the interval, the green-shirted supporters in the capacity crowd starting to believe that the upset was on.
The Springboks had not lost to the All Blacks in 21 Tests when leading or level at half-time, but despite being a man down New Zealand closed the gap to two points as a spell of carefully worked territory was capped with a Carter drop-goal.
Schalk Burger then lost the ball metres from his own line, the All Blacks went right and drove on through their forwards before Ma'a Nonu sent replacement Barrett diving into the corner.
With Habana sin-binned for knocking the ball from scrum-half Aaron Smith's hands and Carter bending over the conversion for 17-12, the match appeared to have turned.
Pollard and Carter exchanged penalties, and with replacements pouring on to the pitch and the rain hammering down the two heavyweights went toe to toe.
Pat Lambie came on for Pollard to make it 20-18 with 10 minutes to go, and an air of desperation was apparent in both sides.
Carter sprinted half the length of the pitch to clear from De Allende, South Africa failed to capitalise from an attacking line-out and New Zealand escaped into opposition territory as the seconds crawled by, running the clock down with a series of drives to celebrate with exhaustion at the end.
Ben Smith was faultless under the high ball and Dan Carter's decision-making once again peerless.
However, for his muscular, repeated carrying in a relentlessly physical match and the superb run and timing of pass for Beauden Barrettt's critical second-half try, Ma'a Nonu deserves the honour.
New Zealand coach Steve Hansen: "It was always going to be close, they're a great side and they showed that again. I was really proud of our guys, they kept their composure.
"We just needed to come out for the second half and start taking the game to them rather than waiting for them to take it to us. We talked about it at half-time. We talked about keeping composure and talked about winning the first 10 minutes."
South Africa coach Heyneke Meyer: "Our discipline in the second half was just not good enough. They coped better with the weather in the second half. Discipline was the most important thing, especially in these rainy conditions.
"We wanted to make our country proud but we didn't. We should have pulled this win through but all credit to the All Blacks, they are a quality side."

At one stage the highest bid for the three-wheeler stood at more than £150,000, after the advert went viral.
He reset the price after admitting he did not expect the bidder to pay up.
In the listing's description, Mr Andresier, of Sarisbury Green, said: "This was purchased against my wishes many years ago as I never wanted any children and a buggy signified my wife's intent to have children.
"We argued much and this buggy signifies everything that ended my happy carefree low cost child free life."
It prompted six pages of questions which led the advert to exceed the number of customer enquiries allowed by the online auction site.
Mr Andresier wrote: "Looks like I have hit the eBay limit for shared responses to all your wonderful questions. It doesn't look like the last 50 or so replies from today have been added to the listing. Sorry people - looks like you have broken eBay."
On the comments pages, one user described Mr Andresier as a "marketing genius", while another did not see the funny side and said he was "pathetic".
He said he would use the proceeds from the sale to "help me recover from children".
Mr Andresier's wife Susan, 36, had said she found the listing "hilarious", and added the couple had been amazed by its popularity on social media.

Article: Wellington monument on the Blackdown Hills, in Somerset, was built in 1817 but since 2005 it has been fenced off because of falling stone debris.
The National Trust is using ground-penetrating radar on the 174ft (53m) tower to see under its stone cladding.
Ken Evans, from the trust, said the work was "crucial".
Built on one of the highest points of the Blackdown Hills, the landmark was put up as a tribute to the Duke of Wellington's military achievements at the Battle of Waterloo.
But according to the trust, it has been struck by lightning twice in its history and renovating the very tall landmark every 10 to 15 years has been "expensive and unsustainable".
Mr Evans, the trust's building surveyor, said the radar study was one of several being carried out to "understand this unique and somewhat complex monument".
"We have been using wind and movement sensors which have already surprised us by showing that it doesn't flex in the wind quite as much as we expected," he said.
"The ground-penetrating radar seeks to identify voids and gaps in the stonework under the surface but should also tell us more about the materials which were used to build the obelisk."
Data from the detailed survey will also be used to build a computer model of the obelisk and help with a "more effective repair approach".

Article: Hadleigh Parkes and Gareth Owen went over for the Welsh side in the first half and Scarlets were good value for their 15-9 lead at half-time.
But three Ian Madigan penalties kept Leinster within touching distance and they dominated the second half.
Mike Ross' close-range try and Madigan's conversion soon after the restart put Leinster into the lead and another Madigan penalty capped the win.
Leinster coach Leo Cullen had named a completely new starting XV for the game against the league leaders, his options boosted by the return of half-a-dozen Ireland internationals.
Scarlets also had returning World Cup stars, with scrum-half Gareth Davies returning to the fold after Wales duty.
The Welsh side took an early grip with a series of drives at the Leinster line that allowed centre Parkes the space to barrel over, his try converted by Dan Jones.
Leinster responded to put Scarlets under pressure, with lock Jake Ball sin-binned for overstepping the boundaries during some frantic defence.
In his absence Leinster closed the gap with two Madigan penalties, although they lost Rob Kearney to injury and there could be a nervous wait to see if the Ireland full-back is fit for Europe next weekend.
Back to full strength, Scarlets stretched away again as number eight John Barclay joined the line to put Owen away for an unconverted try.
Madigan added a third penalty but Jones responded in kind to ensure Scarlets took a six-point lead into the break, although it could have been more with Aled Thomas wide with a long-range kick.
As well as Scarlets had played, they found themselves behind for the first time within five minutes of the restart as Ross went under almost under the posts for a converted try after a series of forward drives.

Johnny Sexton come off the bench for the home side, with the Ireland fly-half slotting in at centre outside Madigan.
The combination almost produced a decisive try as Sexton loped away to the line, only to be denied by a crossing call confirmed by video replays.
But Madigan added his fourth penalty to give Leinster a four-point cushion, although Scarlets at least had the consolation of a losing bonus point despite being dominated in the second half.
Scarlets coach Wayne Pivac told BBC Radio Wales: "I'm very disappointed, I thought the boys played very well. I'm disappointed the breakdown was refereed one way, I thought.
"The stream of penalties against us [made the difference], I thought we got into some really good positions over the ball and every other week we're getting penalties for that.
"From where I was sitting, we got into some great positions for turnovers and didn't get the rewards... It should have been seven wins.
"I don't think it takes anything out [of the season's momentum], the boys know they can compete with these sides now away from home.
"That was the pleasing side of it, that we had an opportunity to win the game at the end but we probably blew it really. We got in behind them when Maselino [Paulino] had the big break and we bombed a try."

How Zara's founder became the richest man in the world - for two days
Chairman and chief executive Pablo Isla emphasised the firm's investment in technology, saying the firm had expanded its online stores to 11 new countries in the period.
It also launched mobile phone payment in all its Spanish stores, with the objective of "extending the service to other countries".
This will encompass online apps for all of its brands and a specific app for the whole group called InWallet.
Mr Isla said: "Both our online and bricks-and-mortar stores are seamlessly connected, driven by platforms such as mobile payment, and other technological initiatives that we will continue to develop."
Tom Gadsby, an analyst at Liberum, said the firm's "online drive" was important.
"I expect over the years they may find they don't have to open as many stores to maintain their strong growth rate as the online channel will become increasingly important," he said.
"And while Zara is available in many of the territories in which they operate [online], most of their other brands aren't readily available outside Europe online.
"So there is a big opportunity there for them to expand online into new territories."
The company also said it had benefited from steady economic growth in Spain, where Inditex gets about a fifth of its sales.
That country's clothing market grew at an average of 3% in the three-months to the end of July, according to the Spanish statistics agency.
All of the group's brands increased their international presence during the period, with 83 new stores opened in 38 countries.
In a call with analysts, it said it would open 6-8% of new store space over course of the year.
The firm's strong performance sets it apart from European rivals H&M and Next, which have blamed unseasonal weather for below-forecast results this year.

Article: Malaysia's attorney general cleared Mr Najib of allegations of corruption on Tuesday after ruling that the money was a donation from the Saudi royal family.
Mr Najib had denied that the money came from state investment fund 1MDB.
The Saudi source said the donation was made amid concern in Riyadh about the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood.
At the time, Malaysia's opposition alliance included the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS). Its founders were inspired by the Brotherhood, although there is little evidence the Brotherhood actually has much support in Malaysia.
Mr Najib's coalition went on to win the election, but with one of its poorest showings in more than 50 years in power.
Malaysia's'mysterious millions' - case solved?
1MDB: The case riveting Malaysia
Profile: Najib Razak
The secretive donation to Mr Najib was allegedly paid over in several wire transfers between late March 2013 and early April 2013, just ahead of the election on 5 May.
The well-placed Saudi source, who has asked not to be named, told the BBC the payment was authorised from the very top - from Saudi Arabia's late King Abdullah - with funds coming from both his personal finances and state funds.
Prince Turki bin Abdullah, one of the king's sons, is reported to have had extensive business dealings in Malaysia.
The purpose of the donation was simple, said the Saudi source - it was to help Mr Najib and his coalition win the election, employing a strategic communications team with international experience, focusing on the province of Sarawak, and funding social programmes through party campaigning.
But why should the Saudis care about an election in a non-Arab country more than 6,000 km (3,700 miles) away? The answer, the source said, lay in their concerns over the rising power of the Muslim Brotherhood, which they consider a terrorist organisation.
The Saudis were already upset at events in Egypt, where President Mohammed Morsi was busy consolidating the Brotherhood's hold on the country.
It would be another three months before Mr Morsi was to be deposed by the army, and the Saudis were convinced that the opposition was being supported by the Brotherhood and Qatar, which backed the Brotherhood and other Islamist groups in the Middle East.
So how unusual is it for the Saudi royal family to hand over this amount of cash in a personal donation? Not at all, said the Saudi insider, adding that Jordan, Morocco, Egypt and Sudan have all been beneficiaries of multi-$100m donations from the Saudi royal purse.
"There is nothing unusual about this donation to Malaysia," he said. "It is very similar to how the Saudis operate in a number of countries."
Saudi Arabia was quick to support the overthrow of Mr Morsi in Egypt, providing the military-backed government with billions of dollars in aid and loans.
Jordan has been the beneficiary of more than $1bn in Saudi development funding, while Riyadh has deposited more than $1bn in Sudan's central bank and signed deals to finance dams on the Nile. Morocco has been provided with oil, financing, investments and jobs in recent years.
However, questions are still being asked about the secretive and convoluted nature of the money transfer, and the fact that Malaysia's prime minister returned 91% of it just four months later. The remaining $61m has not been accounted for.
A British corporate investigator with extensive experience of the Middle East told the BBC that the $681m was paid through the Singapore branch of a Swiss bank owned by the rulers of Abu Dhabi.
"It is very murky", he said. "This case will never be fully cleared up until the Saudis and the Malaysians release all the transaction data, and that has not happened."
There has been growing outrage in some circles in Malaysia that the attorney-general has closed the file on this case and cleared the prime minister of any offences.
Clare Rewcastle Brown, who has reported extensively on the issue for the Sarawak Report, said the claim that the payment to Mr Najib was a Saudi royal donation for political purposes needed to be treated "with considerable caution".
She told the BBC that the $681m was far more likely to be connected to money raised by 1MDB, much of which is reported to have gone missing.

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence.
The $681m (Â£479m) deposited in the bank account of Malaysian PM Najib Razak by Saudi Arabia was to help him win the 2013 elections, a Saudi source says.

Article: With a television audience of 110 million, it's one of the biggest platforms in the world - and Gaga has been putting in the hours to ensure her set is suitably spectacular.
"We were [rehearsing] in the tent for about a week and a half, then we had to move to bigger studios in Hollywood where we are working on the rest of the show," she told Houston radio station Mix 96.5.
"And then we will send that equipment to Houston where we will finish rehearsals. Fans can expect a performance that spans my career so far."
She has a high standard to live up to - notably Prince's show in 2007, which took place in the middle of a Miami thunderstorm and is widely accepted as the greatest performance in the event's history, if not Prince's career.
Here are some of the other most memorable - and surprising - moments from the last 30 years.
Super Bowl performers get a very strict 12-minute time limit, so most performers cram their set with as much music as possible.
Not Michael Jackson.
After shooting onto the stage at the Pasadena Rose Bowl, he stood completely still, staring at the world for a full 90 seconds. Ninety.
It was a master class in ratcheting expectation to a fever pitch. And the screams when he launched into Jam (not one of his best songs) proved he knew what he was doing.
Brilliantly, Jackson staged this entire performance while wearing a jacket it looked like he'd borrowed from Muammar Gaddafi.
Beat that, Gaga.
Baby, he was born to run... and slide on his knees... and crotch slam a TV camera.
In his autobiography, The Boss explains the incident like this: "Too much adrenalin, a late drop, too much speed, here I come, Mikeâ€¦ BOOM!
"And I'm onto his camera, the lens implanted into my chest with one leg off the stage. I use his camera to push myself back up andâ€¦ BLAM! BORN TO RUN!"
It led to the memorable headline: "America Attacked by Bruce Springsteen's crotch" - but it didn't stop the star delivering one of the most powerful and energetic Super Bowl shows in recent history. Even if they were fined for over-running by 40 seconds.
Coldplay were the headline act at last year's Super Bowl in Santa Clara - but someone forgot to tell Beyonce.
She only performed one song, Formation, underscoring its message of black pride and power with back-up dancers dressed in leather body suits and black berets reminiscent of the Black Panthers movement.
Some of her dancers were even pictured holding up a sign declaring "Justice 4 Mario Woods" - a 26-year-old black man who was shot dead by armed police in San Francisco two months earlier.
The performance heralded the arrival of her unapologetically political album, Lemonade, later in the year.
You can't out-diva Diana, something she was determined to prove when she strode onto the pitch in Tempe, Arizona, for Super Bowl XXX.
She raced through 10 songs and four costume changes in 12 minutes, then jumped into a helicopter and fled the stadium. Which is one way to beat the post-game traffic.
For the first few decades, the Super Bowl half-time performance featured marching bands, drill teams and Disney's mouseketeers.
1987's show was altogether more bizarre.
A magician named "Elvis Presto" burst out of a jukebox, before performing a series of conjuring tricks, aided by 2,000 part-time dancers, 102 custom Harley Davidson motorcycles and some of rock's biggest classics.
At the culmination of the show, the "Prince of Prestidigitation" performed an interactive magic trick ("pick a card, concentrate real hard") while viewers at home watched through 3D glasses.
It was cheesier than a wheel of brie - and prompted the NFL to adopt a more modern approach.
She arrived on a mechanical tiger, and departed on a shooting star - but Katy Perry couldn't compete with the infamous "left shark".
He was one of two foam-suited dancers flanking Katy while she performed Teenage Dream. While the one on the right was forgettable, the left shark flailed around in a desperate attempt to remember his dance moves.
It quickly became a viral sensation, spawning a whole range of merchandise from the ever-savvy pop star.
And when the half-time show was nominated for an Emmy, Katy made sure to thank her faithful friend.
Poor old Janet Jackson. She was at the end of a triumphant, hit-laden medley when Justin Timberlake ripped the front off her bodice, revealing a heavily-bejewelled superboob.
Few ever believed that the "wardrobe malfunction" was indeed a malfunction - but if you look at the photographs taken immediately after the event, Jackson appears mortified (notably, these were not the pictures printed by the press).
Nonetheless, America went apoplectic. The Federal Complaints Commission reportedly got more than 200,000 complaints, while Janet was blacklisted by MTV and radio. Her career never fully recovered.
But there is a bright side to this story. A PayPal employee called Jawed Karim missed the half-time show and grew frustrated that he couldn't watch the incident online.
In response, he and his friends Steve Chen and Chad Hurley began coding a website where people could upload their own content. That site would end up being YouTube.

Article: Inspectors criticised Darul Uloom school when they saw a "female governor sat out of sight of the male governors in an adjacent room".
But a statement from the school says the school did not segregate, but was respecting the governor's choice.
A wave of Ofsted inspections found nine private faith schools "inadequate".
Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw had written on Tuesday to Education Secretary Nicky Morgan with the findings of inspections of 22 private faith schools, in cities including Manchester, Coventry, Birmingham and Leicester.
These had formerly been inspected by an independent group - the Bridge Schools Inspectorate - but from this autumn Ofsted has taken over responsibility for carrying out checks.
Religious studies GCSE 'error of law'
Inspectors raised concerns including that some of these private faith schools were not "promoting fundamental British values" and were not encouraging "mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs".
They highlighted particular concern about Darul Uloom Islamic High School in Birmingham, where inspectors observed that "the only female governor sat out of sight of the male governors in an adjacent room to the main meeting.
"As a result, she could only contribute to the meeting through a doorway. Governors told inspectors this was their usual arrangement.
"A senior HMI has pointed out to the school that this practice is unacceptable as it fails to show proper respect for women."
In response, a statement from the school says that visitors, parents and governors can "sit where and how they wish as they feel comfortable, and we never assert any restrictions on this".
The private boys' schools says it has an "open door policy" and has hosted meetings including for a local faith forum and for the West Midlands police.
The school issued a statement from the unnamed governor saying that "my request to sit as I please" was a way of "demonstrating the school's strong promotion of both Islamic and British values".
"The right for a person to choose is a universal value," she said. But she claimed that the "British values" requirement was opposed to this.
Darul Uloom, now rated as inadequate, had been inspected by Ofsted inspectors since 2011. In October 2013, Ofsted rated it as good and described the head teacher as "forward thinking".
Ofsted says that although its own inspectors carried out a number of inspections in recent years, the school was considered to have been part of the BSI inspection system.
Among the 22 schools inspected 15 were Muslim and seven Christian.
They had been part of a group of about 50 private schools which had been assessed by the Bridge Schools Inspectorate, which now is no longer approved to inspect schools.
Among the 22 schools inspected by Ofsted, one was "outstanding", four were rated "good", eight were rated as "requires improvement" and nine were "inadequate".
Sir Michael's letter to the education secretary says it should be a priority to inspect other former Bridge Schools Inspectorate schools.

The female governor at a private Muslim school in Birmingham - at the centre of criticism from Ofsted - chose to sit separately from men, says the school.

Article: It comes as a documentary, The Betrayed Girls is being shown on BBC One about nine Asian men jailed for grooming teenage girls in the town in 2012.
Laura, who was abused by the gang from the age of 13 until she was 17, said the targeting of girls by Asian men was still going on in Greater Manchester.
Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said it was "committed" to tackling abusers.
Laura, whose identity is protected as a victim of a sex crime, told BBC Two's Victoria Derbyshire show said she was walking in Oldham town centre through an Asian community a couple of months ago.
"I was still getting cars pulling over to me asking me if I wanted to go for a drink," said Laura.
"It's not bothering them. I don't actually think they understand that they are doing something wrong."
Nazir Afzal the north west's former chief crown prosecutor who brought the case against the Rochdale gang said five years on some victims nationally are still not being listened to.
Mr Afzal overturned a decision not to charge nine men who ran the child sex exploitation ring.
He said there have been "significant rises" in investigations and prosecutions into the crime and victims were more confident in reporting abuse and they are getting better support.
However, he said: "Victim support groups nationally are still telling me victims are not being consistently listened to and told the case is too difficult to bring [to court]."
He also said some victims of historical child sex exploitation were being told that police were focusing on current cases, too.
Mr Afzal said agencies must be more proactive and more "collaborative working" was needed between the police, councils and other agencies and voluntary groups.
GMP said it was "vital" they learnt the lessons from the past and it was "absolutely committed" to working with partners across Greater Manchester to tackle the sexual exploitation of children and young people.
"We have been working tirelessly for many years to prevent this abhorrent crime from happening and provide support to victims and their families."
Rochdale Council said public services "collectively failed" the victims but lessons have "been learnt from it".
Steve Rumbelow, chief executive of Rochdale Borough Council, said: "Since 2012 the council and its partners have worked to make the changes needed, to increase knowledge, prevent harm, challenge those who wish to exploit children and better support victims and survivors."
The documentary which features testimonies from victims for the first time follows a BBC One drama Three Girls.

Article: The work shows that DNA and its chemical cousin RNA are not unique in their ability to encode information and to pass it on through heredity.
The work,  
          reported in Science
, is promising for future "synthetic biology" and biotechnology efforts.
It also hints at the idea that if life exists elsewhere, it could be bound by evolution but not by similar chemistry.
In fact, one reason to mimic the functions of DNA and RNA - which helps cells to manufacture proteins - is to determine how they came about at the dawn of life on Earth; many scientists believe that RNA arose first but was preceded by a simpler molecule that performed the same function.
However, it has remained unclear if any other molecule can participate in the same unzipping and copying processes that give DNA and RNA their ability to pass on the information they carry in the sequences of their nucleobases - the five chemical group "letters" from which the the two molecules' genetic information is composed.
The classic double-helix structure of DNA is like a twisted ladder, where the steps are made from paired nucleobases (RNA is typically a single helix).
Philipp Holliger of the UK Medical Research Council's Laboratory of Molecular Biology and a team of colleagues created six different DNA- and RNA-like molecules - xeno-nucleic acids, or XNAs - by replacing not the nucleobases but the sugar groups that make up the sides of the ladder.
"There's a lot of chemisty that seeks to build alternative nucleic acids, and people have been modifying the bases, the sugars and the backbone, but what we were focusing on was the type of nucleic acid or polymers that would retain the ability to communicate with the natural DNA," Dr Holliger explained in an interview for the Science podcast.
Because the nucleobases themselves were the same as those of DNA and RNA, the resulting molecules were able to join with their natural counterparts.
The effect is similar to work  
          recently published in Nature Chemistry
, showing that another sugar-substituted DNA analogue could be made to pair up with DNA itself.
But the crucial point in creating a full "synthetic genetics" is a set of nucleic acids like DNA and RNA that can not only carry genetic information, but would also allow it to be changed and passed on - evolution and heredity.
That requires a set of helper molecules called polymerases, which, once DNA or RNA "unzip" and expose their genetic information, help create new DNA molecules from those instructions.
Dr Holliger and his colleagues have developed polymerases that efficiently transcribe the code of their synthetic DNA to natural DNA and then from that back to another synthetic DNA.
The process of evolution was encouraged in the lab; one of their DNA analogues was designed to cling to a particular protein or RNA target, those that failed to do so were washed away.
As successive copies of those that stuck were made, variations in the genetic code - and the resulting structure the molecules took on - led to ever more tightly attached XNAs.
"We've been able to show that both heredity - information storage and propagation - and evolution, which are really two hallmarks of life, can be reproduced and implemented in alternative polymers other than DNA and RNA," Dr Holliger explained.
"There is nothing 'Goldilocks' about DNA and RNA - there is no overwhelming functional imperative for genetic systems or biology to be based on these two nucleic acids."
In  
          an accompanying article in Science
, Gerald Joyce of the Scripps Research Institute wrote that "the work heralds the era of synthetic genetics, with implications for exobiology (life elsewhere in the Universe), biotechnology, and understanding of life itself".
But the work does not yet represent a full synthetic genetics platform, he pointed out. For that, a self-replicating system that does not require the DNA intermediary must be developed.
With that in hand, "construction of genetic systems based on alternative chemical platforms may ultimately lead to the synthesis of novel forms of life".

Article: South African firm Famous Brands signed a £120m deal to buy the chain from Nando's owner, Capricorn Ventures.
Gourmet Burger Kitchen, founded in 2001, was a "pioneer of the premium burger revolution", Famous Brands said.
The company says that it wants to open 10 to 15 more burger restaurants a year in the UK.
The mass-market burger giants, McDonalds and Burger King, first opened in the UK in the 1970s. While those brands have continued to expand, by the end of the 1990s a new fashion for more expensive burgers had arrived, again from the US.
Upmarket burger brands in the UK now include Byron, Shake Shack and Five Guys, as well as an increasing number of independents. According to analysts Mintel, the premium burger market now accounts for sales worth more than £3bn a year.
Famous Brands plans to double Gourmet Burger Kitchen's 75 UK stores in the next five years and said Brexit uncertainty would not affect its plans.
Consumers still want food that is quick and convenient, but are willing to pay for better ingredients, said Famous Brands' Kevin Hedderwick.
"The fast-casual premium environment is pretty recession-proof," he said.
The price difference between upmarket and fast-food burger shops is quite striking.
Whereas a typical McDonald's quarter-pounder with cheese will set you back less than £3, a Gourmet Burger Kitchen 4oz classic cheeseburger is more than £6. But Gourmet Burger Kitchen also sells more unusual fare, including buffalo burgers and Persian lamb.
Food fashions in the UK range from the super-health-conscious to the indulgent. And at the indulgent end of the scale, consumers are focusing on the quality of the ingredients and being able to personalise the menu, by selecting different options.
"Consumers see freshly made burgers as the biggest marker of a gourmet burger venue, something that sets them apart, as this is not traditionally offered by fast food venues," said Kiti Soininen, head of UK food and drink research at Mintel.
"Customisation is also a top expectation for gourmet offerings, in line with a more general demand for knowing what goes into one's food and the trend for personalisation."

Wimpy owner Famous Brands has swallowed UK chain Gourmet Burger Kitchen, as the fashion for upmarket burgers in the UK shows no signs of slowing down.

Article: According to three separate analyses, a flood of automated comments to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was detected over the weekend.
More than 400,000 comments with remarkably similar wording have been detected in recent days.
Net neutrality proponents argue that all internet traffic should be equal.
This means that no content provider should be able to, for example, charge more for faster access to certain data.
One expert described bot activity as a new form of protest.
"Someone has gone out of their way to make these seem like real submissions," wrote Chris Sinchok in a blog post about the apparently automated activity.
Having downloaded the comments and associated data, Mr Sinchok noticed that the names and email addresses associated with thousands of them also turned up in lists of personal data stolen from websites.
He told the BBC that this suggested someone might be using information collected from breached databases to make the submissions look more authentic.
"It really seems like this is getting pooled from some place in an automated fashion and it's coming in at unreasonable rates," he said.
He added that the uniformity of the data was also a possible giveaway.
For example, many comments are essentially identical save for the occasional, small difference - such as the exact same sentence appearing in multiple comments, but with different letters capitalised each time.
And the rate at which comments were posted also seemed suspicious, starting and stopping in bursts, he added.
Other watchers, including a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and another at Harvard University, have also tracked a boom in apparently automated activity directed at the site in recent days.
Earlier this month, the FCC said it had been targeted by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack that led to downtime for the comments system.
This followed a television appearance by comedian John Oliver in which he urged people to post comments against the proposals on the FCC's website.
"Net neutrality is such a hot-button issue and it's one of the few examples of online activism that's actually amounted to something," noted Prof Phil Howard at the Oxford Internet Institute.
He cited the 2014 online protests, after which President Obama stepped in to recommend that the FCC drop earlier proposals to curtail net neutrality.
"This is how people protest these days," said Prof Howard, referring to the apparently automated comments.
He also pointed out that a growing number of people had the necessary programming skills to do it.
However, Mr Sinchok is concerned that the bot activity will create the impression that genuine opposition to the FCC's current proposals does not really exist.
"There are people that care about this issue a lot," he told the BBC.
"Activity like this is really muddying the waters - and I don't want it to give [the FCC] an excuse to say, 'Hey, there's mixed support for this.'"
The FCC has not yet responded to a BBC request for comment.

The names will be announced during the One Show on BBC One between 19:00 and 19:30 GMT.
A capacity crowd of about 12,000 will attend the show at the First Direct Arena in Leeds on Sunday, 15 December.
The programme will follow on from last year's awards where Sir Bradley Wiggins was crowned 2012 Sports Personality.
Full roll of honour
After Tuesday's announcement, there will be details of all the contenders and arrangements for public voting on the night at www.bbc.co.uk/sportspersonality.
Tour de France winner and Olympic road cycling champion Wiggins was the latest to join an illustrious roll of honour last year when he received the coveted trophy from the Duchess of Cambridge and former England football captain David Beckham, watched on television by more than 15m people.
Presenter Gary Lineker said: "It's going to be tough to follow last year, the most unbelievable sporting year in living memory, but the fact that it is the 60th anniversary, the fact that it is coming to Leeds, means it's still going to be a huge show."
Director of BBC Sport Barbara Slater added: "We're thrilled Leeds is to host BBC Sports Personality of the Year 2013. The sporting heritage of the city is outstanding and the new arena will be a great venue from which to celebrate the very best of sport."
Devised by Sir Paul Fox in 1954, the first Sports Personality of the Year was held at the Savoy Hotel in London, where it was presented by Peter Dimmock. World record-breaking 5,000m runner Sir Christopher Chataway beat four minute-mile hero Sir Roger Bannister to the award that year as the public voted for the first winner.
The trophy has since been won by many of the greats of British sport, including Bobby Moore, Princess Anne, Lord Coe, Daley Thompson, Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean, Sir Steve Redgrave, David Beckham, Dame Kelly Homes, Andrew Flintoff, Sir Chris Hoy and many more.

The show went on the road in 2006, taking in Birmingham, Liverpool, Sheffield, Manchester and London. To date, more than 55,000 people have enjoyed spending a spectacular evening with the stars of the sporting year.
Lineker added: "Taking the show out on the road has worked really well. It has proven to be hugely popular. You get thousands of people who can come along and enjoy the live show and it just becomes more of an event.
"When you get the people there who really want to be there - the supporters, the sports fans - it just adds to the atmosphere and I'm sure it will be the same in Leeds."
Most tickets for the event have been sold, although a limited number will be made available later in November.

Article: Attendances have fallen in recent years since the Premiership side moved from Edgeley Park in Stockport to AJ Bell Stadium in Barton in 2012.
Sale have moved home games back to Friday nights for the upcoming season.
"I think there is some rebuilding to do because I think people in the early days of moving have had a pretty poor experience," Cotton told BBC Sport.
"That could be queuing up on a motorway, couldn't get away from the stadium, couldn't buy a drink at the ground. Listening to the things we're going to do to change that, if people come down from now they will find a very different experience.
"The infrastructure is still well away from where it needs to be but there are plans to develop that."
Cotton, 69, a former England and British and Irish Lions prop returned to Sale - a club he served as both a player and director - after Simon Orange's takeover of the Premiership side in June.
He has promised to be active in his role, despite his commitments with his clothing business.
"What I really want to see is a very strong north of England club that can compete at the highest level," he added.
"That is my motivation for giving up the precious thing that I have got, and that is my time.
"I think what was lacking before was that the board weren't very often represented at games home and away, and I think that is very wrong - board members will travel to away games and home games."
One of the standout announcements from Sale's new 10-man board was that director of rugby Steve Diamond will have a seat on it.
However, Cotton insists there will be no conflict of interest with a member of the coaching staff also working as a director.
"It will put no strain whatsoever on the relationship, we're here to support him," Cotton continued.
"We'll be working very closely with Diamond to make sure we can achieve the ambition which we all hold - if we went down we'd still be with them."
Diamond also confirmed they are close to signing a new full-back and are still looking for another player to add to their backline, with former Bath and London Welsh winger Nick Scott on trial with the club.

Article: The 28-year-old Scotland international has spent the last two seasons with Wasps, having previously had a six-year spell with Glasgow Warriors.
"His style fits the way we play perfectly and he will provide excellent competition," said incoming Quins director of rugby John Kingston.
"We are looking forward to adding his expertise next season."
Harlequins have not disclosed the length of Jackson's deal at The Stoop.
Jackson has won 28 caps for Scotland since making his Test debut against New Zealand in 2010, and made one appearance at this year's Six Nations.
"I'm extremely excited to be starting a new challenge with Harlequins," he said.

Article: The film about a princess's mythical journey in ancient Polynesia took an estimated $81.1m (£65.3m) on its debut.
That makes it the second-highest Thanksgiving debut of all time, behind Disney's Frozen, which took $93.6m (£75.3m) on its release in 2013.
Some observers have said that Moana and its merchandise are appropriating Pacific Island culture.
Disney withdrew a children's costume promoting the film after activists branded it "brownface", or mocking of their culture by stereotyping.
The costume, a full-body suit with brown skin, traditional tattoos, grass skirt and bone necklace, represented the character Maui, considered a demi-god and ancestor by many Polynesians.
Disney said it regretted any offence.
JK Rowling's Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them fell to second on the US chart, taking $65.8m (£53m).
Gossip surrounding Brad Pitt's marriage break-up failed to spark a huge amount of interest in his World War Two romance Allied, which also stars Marion Cotillard.
It took $18m (£14.4m) over the long weekend, having cost $85m (£68.5m) to make, landing in fourth spot behind Doctor Strange.
Kyle Davies, Paramount's head of domestic distribution, said the film appealed to "older audiences" but noted those "don't storm the theatres [on] weekend one".
"I think they're going to take their time," he added.
Warren Beatty fared worse - his first film in 15 years, the 1950s Hollywood comedy Rules Don't Apply, took just $2.2m (£1.7m). The film is Beatty's first directed feature since 1998's Bulworth.
Bad Santa 2, released 13 years after the original and again starring Billy Bob Thornton, did a little better, taking $9m (£7.3m).

Article: Police said the man was detained as part of an ongoing investigation into the conflict in Syria.
Officers from the South East Counter Terrorism Unit (SECTU) and Sussex Police are searching one residential address.
The arrest is not linked to any immediate threat in the UK, police said.
Crawley MP Henry Smith said police told him early this morning that a 40-year-old man had been arrested at a property thought to be in the Langley Green area of the town.
He said: "I understand he has been arrested in relation to membership of organisations which are connected with activity to the Syrian civil war."
Mr Smith said he understood people would be concerned over news of the arrest, particularly following the death of Abdul Waheed Majeed, from Crawley, who died in a suspected suicide attack in Syria in February last year.
The 41-year-old, who was born and raised in Crawley, drove a truck bomb into the gates of a prison in Aleppo.
The father of three had left Britain in 2013 telling his family he was going on a humanitarian mission to Syria.
Mr Smith said: "These cases are in the minority but they are very concerning and the public need to feel that they are as protected as they can be."
A spokesperson for SECTU said the unit was committed to intervening in activities "which cause concern to local communities".
"We will continue to work with our partners and local communities in order to protect them from individuals and organisations which may seek to exploit them for extremist purposes," the spokesperson added.
Local residents are being asked to contact police if they have any concerns regarding extremist activity in the area.

The 40-year-old won Olympic heptathlon bronze for Britain in 2004 and has been upgraded to two more bronze medals from 2008 after retrospective drug tests.
All world records set before 2005 could be rewritten under a new proposal from European Athletics, after the sport's latest doping scandal.
Sotherton said tweaking events would create "a new slate" and new records.
She said: "Could we go back to yards or run 101m instead of 100m?
"We all know that some of the records are completely out there. But not all of those records were achieved by people who cheated.
"Scrapping those records is unfair on those athletes. And what about my pre-2005 performances? Did they happen? Does this apply to national records too?"
Sotherton referred to the IAAF's decision to remodel the men's javelin in 1986.
Changes were made to the javelin's design because of increasingly frequent flat landings. All existing records were reset after the change, but not erased.
"I am open to the discussion - for the greater good of the sport it's a good thing," she added.

Article: The 26-year-old midfielder has signed "an initial one-year deal", with Ray McKinnon expressing delight at his first signing as manager at Tannadice.
"He is exactly the type of player we need going into this season," he said.
"Not only is he the right age and a good footballer, but he is a ball winner who is strong in the tackle and will protect our central defenders."
Murdoch had joined County last summer after his departure from Fleetwood Town.
But half of his 34 appearances came as a substitute and he followed fellow midfielder Rocco Quinn out of the Scottish Premiership club.
Murdoch, who began his career with Falkirk and had a loan spell with Northampton Town before joining Fleetwood in 2013, told United's website: "I'm delighted to be joining Dundee United - it was an easy decision to make.
"It's a massive club and I want to help them get back to the Premiership, where they should be."
Following United's relegation from the top flight, 13 players have exited Tannadice along with manager Mixu Paatelainen and his backroom staff.

Article: They made the connection on an expedition to the boy's village, Meliandou.
They took samples and chatted to locals to find out more about Ebola's source.
The team's findings are published in EMBO Molecular Medicine.
Meliandou is a small village of 31 houses.
It sits deep within the Guinean forest region, surrounded by towering reeds and oil palm cultivations - these are believed to have attracted the fruit bats carrying the virus passed on to Emile.
During their four-week field trip in April 2014, Dr Fabian Leendertz and colleagues found a large tree stump situated about 50m from Emile's home.
Villagers reported that children used to play frequently in the hollow tree.
Emile - who died of Ebola in December 2013 - used to play there, according to his friends.
The villagers said that the tree burned on March 24, 2014 and that once the tree caught fire, there issued a "rain of bats".
A large number of these insectivorous free-tailed bats - Mops condylurus in Latin - were collected by the villagers for food, but disposed of the next day after a government-led ban on bushmeat consumption was announced.
While bushmeat is thought to be a possible source of Ebola, the scientists believe it didn't trigger the outbreak.
Instead, it was Emile's exposure to the bats and their droppings as he played with his friends in the hollowed tree.
The scientists took and tested ash samples from the tree and found DNA traces that were a match for the animals.
While they were unable to test any of the bushmeat that the villagers had disposed of, they captured and tested any living bats they could find in and around Meliandou.
No Ebola could be detected in any of these hundred or so animals, however.
But previous tests show this species of bat can carry Ebola.
Dr Leendertz, from the Robert Koch Institute in Germany, and his colleagues say this must be a pretty rare occurrence though.
Dr Leendertz said: "That is also obvious when you think about how many tonnes of bat meat is consumed every year.
"If more bats carried the virus, we would see outbreaks all the time."
He says it is vital to find out more about the bats.
"They have moved into human settlements. They do not just live in the trees but also under the roofs of houses in the villages.
"The Ebola virus must jump through colonies from bat to bat, so we need to know more."
But culling the animals is not the answer.
"We need to find ways to live together with the wildlife. These bats catch insects and pests, such as mosquitoes. They can eat about a quarter of their body weight in insects a day.
"Killing them would not be a solution. You would have more malaria."

The 39-year-old told BBC Essex he would play in this year's tournament if his wife gives birth before his first-round game against Joe Perry on Monday.
"The only question I'd ask myself is if she actually went on the day," he said.
"Obviously it could happen and even now I still haven't got an answer to that question. I'd have to talk it over with my wife and see where we go."
Bingham, the current world number two, said his wife has been supportive in wanting him to play at the tournament, which gets under way on Sunday.
He continued: "She's had two previous babies and she's been in labour for 10 hours, so obviously if that's the case then I've got a bit of time to 'pot some balls and hurry up' sort of thing.

Article: The Â£21.5m Castle Mill development at Port Meadow, by the River Thames, has been widely criticised as ugly and spoiling the view of Oxford's skyline.
The Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) will put its case to a High Court judge on 23 October.
The five-storey university blocks provide 439 accommodation units.
The flats overlook a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Scheduled Ancient Monument.
CPRE is seeking the judicial review on the basis of Oxford City Council not carrying out an environmental impact assessment.
The council has said the challenge was late as the housing had already been built, and it believed the group's claims were unfounded.
Helen Marshall, director of CPRE Oxfordshire, said the West Area Planning Committee "should under no circumstances be rushed into making further poor decisions".
"We are not yet convinced that the planning condition on contamination has been met," she added.
"And the mitigation proposals currently suggested by the university are woefully inadequate to counteract the devastating impact of the buildings on Port Meadow and Oxford's historic skyline.
"A few trees growing to approximately half the height of the buildings in 15 years' time will not meet the brief of 'hiding the buildings in summer and softening their impact in winter'
"Key issues such as the height of the buildings and light pollution still need to be addressed."
A University of Oxford spokesman said it had "thought carefully" about how best to mitigate the impact of the buildings.
"Some measures have already been put in place, and discussions with the city council and others are ongoing about what more we can do," he added.
"The University will be making representations at the interim hearing in October on the procedural issues raised by the challenge.
"In the meantime, we intend to finish and occupy the buildings by the start of the next academic year in October as planned."
The city council said last month it was carrying out an independent review into the case.

Article: "The documentary for me started with the questions: 'Is this the end of film? Is digital going to replace it? What are we losing if that happens and what are we gaining?,'" says Keanu Reeves.
The actor serves as producer, narrator and interviewer on Side by Side, in which he sets out to examine cinema's transition from film to digital formats.
It seems a niche subject, but Reeves and director Chris Kenneally say they were conscious about making the film for a mainstream audience.
"We wanted to take something that was quite specialised and share enough information so people could understand what we'd be speaking about," Reeves says.
But does the average cinema-goer care or notice what format the film they're watching is in?
"If you're not an aficionado, probably not, as long as it was working," admits Reeves.
"If you go and expect to see a Hollywood studio movie and it looked terrible you'd go like, 'what is that?' So I think it could impact in that sense.
"But a perfect film print projected is something that is remarkable and unique."
Side By Side makes no assumptions that audiences will know the technical aspects of filmmaking, so spends some time explaining how cameras work, the photochemical process of developing film and how the introduction of digital cameras has led to the progression of editing and special effects.
And helping to explain is a cast that reads like a Who's Who of cinema.
Directors Martin Scorsese, Christopher Nolan, David Fincher, David Lynch, James Cameron, Danny Boyle, George Lucas and cinematographers Wally Pfister (Inception, The Dark Knight) and Roger Deakins (Skyfall, True Grit) are all present.
Female filmmakers are represented by the likes of legendary editor Anne Coates, who worked on movies like Lawrence of Arabia and The Elephant Man and Lena Dunham, one of Hollywood's hottest talents thanks to her TV show Girls.
Reeves conducted a large share of the interviews himself, which not only helped the filmmakers gain such unprecedented access but also made for a series of relaxed, open conversations.
"I can't say it didn't help that I've been in the industry for however many years - I was a known quantity in that sense," he says.
It took around 18 months to round up and interview all the film-makers. Luckily, a large number of contributors attended an annual cinematography festival in Poland.
However others weren't so easy to get. Directors such as Steven Spielberg and Quentin Tarantino are notably absent.
"There were people who weren't available or who didn't want to speak," he says. "We got turned down a few times which sucked."
Although mainstream Hollywood films have been shot digitally for about the last 12 years, the first digital film to win an Oscar for best cinematography was Slumdog Millionaire in 2009.
Cinematography Oscars followed for Avatar in 2010 and Hugo in 2011 - also shot digitally.
Some see this as a shift in the attitude towards digital film, which had previously been considered inferior in quality.
Filming on celluloid is an expensive and time consuming process. Reels of film that each contain about 10 minutes of footage are developed overnight, creating "dailies". Viewing them is the first chance a director will get to see the product of his previous day's work.
It is only then they discover if they have the right shots or if they have to go back and re-shoot.
The advent of video cameras showed not only that film-making could be done at a fraction of the cost, but that you could see the results immediately. It also enabled anyone to effectively become a film-maker.
The invention of low price digital cameras further democratised the film-making process.
However, advocates for celluloid include Inception director Christopher Nolan and cinematographer Wally Pfister, who maintain digital images will never have the depth or clarity of film, which they insist on using.
On the other side, the likes of George Lucas, James Cameron and David Lynch profess their love for digital and swear they'll never go back.
Another issue addressed in the documentary is digital film archiving and preservation - where the introduction of new formats every couple of years is proving to be problematic.
Indeed, Se7en director David Fincher says he has videos from the early days of his career in unplayable formats, as the hardware no longer exists.
As a result, when he finishes a film, he now stores the relevant player alongside the rushes in his archive, to ensure he is able to watch them back at a later date.
And even with modern technology, hard drives can fail, leading to the loss of digital content.
It is something Reeves admits he had not considered. "I had no idea about the situation we're in right now where there is no standardised means of archiving digital information."
"I didn't know anything about how it could all just go away - it was a bit jaw-dropping."
The irony is that celluloid is the only format that has stood the test of time over the past 100 years and will continue to do so as long as there are projectors to play them on.
Throughout Side by Side, Reeves maintains his impartiality but with filming complete, he is able to share his thoughts.
"Going into the film I was definitely biased to 'what are we losing?'. Film was being held up as the gold standard and digital was this idea of replacing [it]," he says.
"But what I've come to learn is that it's not necessarily replacing it - but that it's something else. And if it is that, then film has a better chance.
"I'm still confident that it's going to hang around."
Side By Side is out in cinemas from Friday, 15 February through Axiom Films.

Article: Dave Baker, of the Olympus Trust which operates near Bristol, said government cuts had left it at "crisis point".
Parents described the funding problem as "diabolical". A union said the idea was "terrible" but families deserved to know the truth about funding.
A Department for Education (DfE) spokesman said new funding plans would increase the trust's budget by 2.4%.
The Olympus Trust runs one secondary, one all-through school and five primary academies in South Gloucestershire, to the north of Bristol.
In the letter Mr Baker warned parents of the "unthinkable" decisions the trust could be forced to make from September.
These include shortening the school day "because we cannot afford to staff lessons for the whole week".
Other proposals are cutting teaching and support jobs within the schools, increasing class sizes and reducing the curriculum.
The letter also says parents may be asked to make regular financial contributions to supplement school funding.
Mr Baker said South Gloucestershire was one of the five worst-funded local authorities so had less reserves to draw upon.
Beckie Morton, a parent of two daughters at Charlborough Road Primary School, is anxious about the impact any cuts will have on her girls, aged 10 and seven.
She said: "It's shocking - I don't know what I'd do work-wise if they shortened the school day.
"If they do this, all that will be left is the lessons and no extra support for pupils.
"My eldest daughter suffers panic attacks and has received a lot of pastoral care - this will have a massive impact on her final year there."
Natalie, who has a son attending at Bradley Stoke Community School, called the proposals "diabolical".
She said: "At the moment we are hoping to have a special needs support worker for my son and if they cut funding he won't have that.
"I don't blame the school, they are trying their best."
In December, the government announced the biggest shake-up of school funding for decades.
The DfE said the current system was "unfair, opaque and outdated" and the changes would see more than half of England's schools get more cash.
"We recognise that schools are facing cost pressures, which is why we will continue to provide support to help them use their funding in cost-effective ways, including improving the way they buy goods and services, soâ€Ž they get the best possible value. "
Kevin Courtney, chair of the National Union of Teachers (NUT), said schools were still facing an 8% reduction in spending power.
He said: "All schools in England will have less money in real terms per pupil in 2020 than they do now.
"This cash they talk about doesn't keep pace with spending pressures on schools.
"The proposals Mr Baker has mentioned are terrible and none of them should happen, but parents deserve to know the truth about the position schools are in."

Article: Goals in each half proved enough for Marcus Bignot's Mariners, who had gone into the game on the back of defeats to Crawley, Portsmouth and Doncaster.
Grimsby broke the deadlock when Bolarinwa took advantage of a slip from Accrington's Omar Beckles to go through one-on-one with goalkeeper Aaron Chapman before slotting the ball home.
Accrington came out well for the restart and went close to pulling level, but Grimsby goalkeeper Dean Henderson, on loan from Manchester United, blocked Billy Kee's shot on the goalline.
As the second-half wore on, Accrington pushed for an equaliser with John O'Sullivan's strike clipping the side-netting and substitute Shay McCartan forcing Henderson to kick away a low effort.
But, as the visitors chased the game, Grimsby sealed the points when top-scorer Omar Bogle set up Chambers and after touching the ball past the last defender, he slammed home the Mariners' second.

Article: Many developing countries will try to curb carbon emissions by setting aside forested areas as reserves.
But experts are worried that creating national parks often involves removing the people who live in these areas.
The study indicated designating forest reserves in Liberia and the Democratic Republic of Congo could displace as many as 1.3 million people.
With funding from Norway, Liberia has proposed 30% of their forests become protected areas by 2020.
DR Congo, funded by Germany and the Global Environmental Facility, aims to set aside 12-15% of their forested lands.
Consultants TMP Systems concluded:
"Governments have targets to expand their protected areas, and now with new climate funding being available the risk is they will use this to expand in a way that doesn't respect local rights," said Andy White, from the Rights and Resources Initiative, the campaign group that sponsored the research.
"It could result in the displacement of millions of people."
Analysts say that this type of displacement has already happened in sub-Saharan Africa, South East Asia and Latin America, and sometimes caused violent conflict.
"I don't think the international community wants to displace rural dwellers in Liberia - but I think if we go about it in the way we are talking about it right now, that is going to be the result," said Constance Teague, from Liberia's Sustainable Development Institute.
"We need to recognise that indigenous communities respect the forest and they have worked on [it] for hundreds of years.
"It may not look like what the international community may expect, but this effort to conserve the land does exist."
Liberia had the largest forest space left in West Africa, largely because of the indigenous communities, she added.
The report also looks into the costs of compensating people for the loss of their lands in both Liberia and DR Congo, which range from $200m (Â£137m) to more than Â£1bn.
The main argument for setting up reserves is to:
And Mr White said: "We need to make evidence available that makes it clear that the woods are full of people, and it makes more sense to help them rather than kick them out.
"Where indigenous peoples rights are protected, and they are able to use their forests for their own livelihoods, they have more carbon per hectare than protected areas.
"They are active protectors, you don't have to pay a park guard, because they protect their forests, and that is what the world needs."
Some 1.5 billion indigenous people inhabit or claim most of the land in the world - but, according to a study released last year, they have legal rights to just 10%.

Article: Bert Davidson, from Hopeman, near Elgin, had not seen his 1929 Humber since he sold it nearly 60 years ago.
But a few years ago he was contacted by Robin Wills - whose father had owned the saloon car in the 1960s and 70s - who had tracked it down to America.
Mr Wills has since restored the dilapidated car to its former glory.
After towing it up to Elgin from his home in Brancepath, County Durham, Mr Davidson once again got a chance to sit behind the wheel.
"I had a run around the block in it. I thoroughly enjoyed the trip," Mr Davidson told the BBC News website.
"It was a grand motor car and he's done a magnificent job restoring it. The paintwork is in its original colours. The interior is all original. He tried to get me to drive it - but I said 'I'd better not!'"
Mr Davidson had first come across the car at an old coachbuilders in Elgin while working at his father's garage following his National Service in 1954.
It was under a dustsheet and he asked the owner if he could buy it.
"He said 'No laddie, I'm not selling it'," Mr Davidson said. "I asked him again eight weeks later. This went on for two years. Eventually he said I could have it and he asked how much I had in my pocket. I got it for Â£15 which was a bargain."
Mr Davidson restored the car and in 1959 entered it in the Kildrummy Rally, where vehicles travelled from Kildrummy to Aberdeen. He won the vintage class.
"I was the only kilted competitor," he said.
Eventually, Mr Davidson's father sold his garage and he had nowhere to keep the car so it had to go.
"I sold the car to a man from RAF Kinloss or Lossiemouth for Â£185," Mr Davidson recalled. "I watched him drive away and put it completely out of my mind. That was the last I saw of it until Robin got in touch 55-60 years later.
"I was very surprised when he got in touch and I am delighted that I'm going to see the car again."
Mr Wills' father bought the car in about 1965 but sold it to a Newcastle car dealer in 1974, when Mr Wills was aged four.
The next time Mr Wills saw it, it was when it appeared in the opening credits of the 1976 Likely Lads film.
"It's unique because it has an owl on the front, on the top of the radiator," he said. "So I knew it was the same car."
Mr Wills' research, which took two years, revealed that the car was later bought by a man who took it to America and it had crossed the Atlantic four times.
It was also owned by the man's brother, Lotus designer Martin Waide.
However, after its engine blew up in 1979 it was never driven again until Mr Wills brought it back to its former glory.
"I used to talk to my dad about the car in my teenage years as I had fond memories of it," he said. "I was delighted and astounded to find it. When I got it back the first thing I did was to open the door, shut my eyes and took a whiff.
"It has the original interior. It hasn't been touched in 98 years. The smell was astounding. It was as if I had been transported back to 1974."
The Humber had some plaques inside it relating to the Kildrummy Rally.
Mr Wills carried out an internet search and found footage of the rally, which included Mr Davidson and the car, on the National Library of Scotland's Moving Image Archive.
"I couldn't believe it," he said. "It was as if someone had walked on my grave. It was an incredible experience."
He then managed to track Mr Davidson down.
"The sense of excitement in his voice was unbelievable," Mr Wills said. "I think he was as excited as I was."
The two men discovered they had more in common than the Humber - they also shared the same birthday.
For Mr Davidson's 80th, Mr Wills sent him the car's original front number plate which the pensioner had made.
"I thought that was great," Mr Davidson said.
The journey to northern Scotland with the car on Saturday was wet at times, forcing Mr Wills to make an emergency stop to buy brass polish.
"I had to buff up the brasswork. I wanted it to look its best for Bert," he said.
"It's been an amazing experience. I feel a bit like Doctor Who, travelling back to meet characters from the past."
The Humber's owners, past and present, exchanged gifts - a photo album of the car and a bottle of whisky from Mr Davidson's home town of Elgin.

Article: Speaking to the New York Times, Mr Trump said the US would only come to the aid of allies if they have "fulfilled their obligations to us".
Members of Nato have all signed a treaty that says they will come to the aid of any member that is attacked.
Mr Trump will speak on Thursday at the Republican National Convention.
In a preview of what he will tell convention-goers in his speech, he outlined a foreign policy strategy aimed at reducing US expenditure and involvement abroad.
What the world wants to know about Trump - Q&A from Cleveland
Although the White House has not responded directly to Mr Trump's comments, spokesman Josh Earnest said on Thursday the US commitment to NATO was "ironclad".
He said potential enemies should not misjudge Washington's commitment to defend its NATO allies.
"The president renewed that commitment just two weeks ago today when he travelled to Warsaw, Poland, to attend the NATO summit."
Mr Trump's comments hit at the fundamental basis of the Atlantic alliance; that an attack on one ally is an attack on all.
Under Article 5 of Nato's founding treaty, allies are bound to come to the aid of a member under attack.
The US has long been pressing its European allies to spend more on defence. That is slowly beginning to have an effect.
But never has there been a suggestion that the US would renege on its responsibilities.
His comments on Turkey suggest that the Republican contender also seems reluctant to insist upon Nato members maintaining strong democratic principles.
Mr Trump's positions will be seen by Washington's Nato partners as at best eccentric and at worst alarming.
At a time of growing tensions with Moscow, the idea that the US might become an unreliable ally is a nightmare for Nato's European members.
Asked about Russian aggression towards Nato countries in the Baltic region, Mr Trump suggested the US might abandon the longstanding protections offered by the US to such nations.
The divisive Republican candidate also said that, if elected, he would not pressure US allies over crackdowns on political opposition and civil liberties, arguing that the US had to "fix our own mess" before "lecturing" other nations.
He said: "Look at what is happening in our country. How are we going to lecture when people are shooting policemen in cold blood?"
Asked about the failed coup in Turkey on Friday, the Republican candidate praised Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has been criticised by some Western leaders over his increasingly authoritarian rule.
"I give great credit to him for being able to turn that around," Mr Trump said of the failed coup. "Some people say that it was staged, you know that," he said. "I don't think so."
US Secretary of State John Kerry has urged Mr Erdogan to follow the rule of law, amid a crackdown on opposition figures by the Turkish leader in the wake of the coup attempt. But Mr Trump chose not to make a similar statement.
"When the world sees how bad the United States is and we start talking about civil liberties, I don't think we are a very good messenger," he said.
The Republican candidate also said that he would reassess the costs to the US of longstanding defence treaties, potentially forcing allies to take on those costs.
He said he would "prefer to be able to continue" existing agreements - but not if he felt allies were taking advantage of the US.
Referring to what he said were US trade losses, Mr Trump said: "We are spending a fortune on military in order to lose $800bn. That doesn't sound very smart to me."
He also suggested he would close US bases abroad. "If we decide we have to defend the United States, we can always deploy" from American soil, he said "and it will be a lot less expensive".
Mr Trump will address the convention on Thursday following speeches from his running mate, Governor Mike Pence and his wife Melania Trump.
Mrs Trump's speech caused embarrassment when journalists noticed that sections of the text appeared to have been copied directly from a speech given by Michelle Obama at the 2008 Democratic Convention.
Senator Ted Cruz, who came second in the Republican primaries, was booed by convention-goers on Thursday after opting not to endorse Mr Trump in his speech.

The names will be announced during the One Show on BBC One between 19:00 and 19:30 GMT.
A capacity crowd of about 12,000 will attend the show at the First Direct Arena in Leeds on Sunday, 15 December.
The programme will follow on from last year's awards where Sir Bradley Wiggins was crowned 2012 Sports Personality.
Full roll of honour
After Tuesday's announcement, there will be details of all the contenders and arrangements for public voting on the night at www.bbc.co.uk/sportspersonality.
Tour de France winner and Olympic road cycling champion Wiggins was the latest to join an illustrious roll of honour last year when he received the coveted trophy from the Duchess of Cambridge and former England football captain David Beckham, watched on television by more than 15m people.
Presenter Gary Lineker said: "It's going to be tough to follow last year, the most unbelievable sporting year in living memory, but the fact that it is the 60th anniversary, the fact that it is coming to Leeds, means it's still going to be a huge show."
Director of BBC Sport Barbara Slater added: "We're thrilled Leeds is to host BBC Sports Personality of the Year 2013. The sporting heritage of the city is outstanding and the new arena will be a great venue from which to celebrate the very best of sport."
Devised by Sir Paul Fox in 1954, the first Sports Personality of the Year was held at the Savoy Hotel in London, where it was presented by Peter Dimmock. World record-breaking 5,000m runner Sir Christopher Chataway beat four minute-mile hero Sir Roger Bannister to the award that year as the public voted for the first winner.
The trophy has since been won by many of the greats of British sport, including Bobby Moore, Princess Anne, Lord Coe, Daley Thompson, Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean, Sir Steve Redgrave, David Beckham, Dame Kelly Homes, Andrew Flintoff, Sir Chris Hoy and many more.

The show went on the road in 2006, taking in Birmingham, Liverpool, Sheffield, Manchester and London. To date, more than 55,000 people have enjoyed spending a spectacular evening with the stars of the sporting year.
Lineker added: "Taking the show out on the road has worked really well. It has proven to be hugely popular. You get thousands of people who can come along and enjoy the live show and it just becomes more of an event.
"When you get the people there who really want to be there - the supporters, the sports fans - it just adds to the atmosphere and I'm sure it will be the same in Leeds."
Most tickets for the event have been sold, although a limited number will be made available later in November.

Article: The University and College Union says the 1.1% rise offered by the universities is "an insult".
But the Universities and Colleges Employers Association said the walkout was "disappointing given the very good pay offer".
Unions representing university support staff are balloting on the offer, with strike action possible in the autumn.
UCU says its members have suffered a real-terms pay cut of 14.% since 2009 and complains the squeeze on staff salaries has come as university leaders enjoyed hefty increases.
"A 1.1% pay offer is an insult to hardworking staff, especially in light of the 5% pay rise vice-chancellors have enjoyed while holding down staff pay," said general secretary Sally Hunt.
"Industrial action which impacts on students is never taken lightly, but members feel that they have been left with no alternative.
"If the employers wish to see a swift end to this dispute, and avoid further disruption, they need to come back to the table with a much-improved offer."
Summer exams are still running at some universities, though many have finished.
A spokesman for the employers anticipated only "minor impact and minimal student disruption".
"Even for examinations which are still taking place at some higher education institutions, more than nine out of 10 report that a no to low impact is anticipated," said the spokesman.
"We would like to see the UCU consulting its members on the final offer."
The employers say the offer is "at, and, for some, beyond, a limit of affordability for higher education institutions and the very best offer that will be available this year".
They maintain the weighting of the offer means the worst paid university staff will get a rise of more than 5%.
They say they have also offered talks on zero-hours contracts and on improving lower pay for female academics.
But UCU says it rejected the 1.1% offer as it was only a marginal improvement on the original 1% on which it had balloted members.
Ballots of university support staff represented by Unison and Unite are also under way on the improved offer, with both unions recommending it be rejected.
Any action would take place during the autumn term, said a Unison spokeswoman.

Article: The government has "called in" proposals to shut St Joseph's Primary in Milngavie near Glasgow.
The council plans to build a new denominational primary in nearby Bearsden - replacing both St Joseph's and the school on the site at present.
Parents at St Joseph's and the Catholic Church have been fighting the plan.
East Dunbartonshire Council plans to merge St Joseph's Primary with St Andrew's Primary in neighbouring Bearsden.
The merged school would be sited in a new building on the current St Andrew's Primary School site.
When the Scottish government calls in any proposal to close a school, it examines the process followed by the council and the information used to reach the decision.
But it cannot simply overturn a decision because it disagrees with it.
A letter informing the council of the government's decision said ministers were concerned by allegations the council's consultation document contained inaccurate information.
It also said concerns raised by Education Scotland may not have been fully addressed by the council in the consultation.
A spokesman for the parents at St Joseph's said: "Parents are delighted that the Scottish government has decided to call this process in.
"It is now clear that the way East Dunbartonshire Council has conducted this process has more holes than a colander.
"We believe and ministers appear to agree that our children will receive the best possible education in their own community."
Council leader Rhonda Gheekie said: "This is a complex process and it's understandable that the Scottish government wants to investigate the proposal further.
"We welcome the same opportunity to explain in greater detail the educational benefits that we believe will come from our proposal to build a new £9m denominational primary school for Bearsden and Milngavie.
"We understand the significance of any new school build for the local community and what we all have in common is that we want to get it right to ensure the best possible future education for the young people in the area."
The council said its proposals were part of its Primary School Improvement Programme to modernise the primary school estate. This aims to deliver state of the art primary schools which are better for pupils and cheaper to run and maintain.
Ms Geekie added: "The council must save a further £20m from its budget over the next three years. On top of the £40m we have already saved, doing nothing in terms of our school estate to help address this was never an option.
"We have to ensure that our school buildings are as cost-effective as they can possibly be to ensure that we are getting value for money from our budget spending."
Meanwhile, the council's plan to close two primary schools in Kirkintilloch and establish a new £7m school to replace them are to go ahead.
The new school there is expected to open in 2016 or 2017.

Article: The man known as Kazu, or 'King Kazu' by some fans, will stay with the second division side past his 49th birthday.
Kazuyoshi first played for Brazilian side Santos in 1986, so his deal will see his career span over 30 years.
"I'm thankful to the club staff and supporters who always offer me support," said Miura, who scored 55 goals in 89 appearances for Japan.
"I'll continue to give everything I have and strive," added the former Genoa and Dinamo Zagreb striker.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Miura holds the record as the oldest scorer in Japanese football - a winner in a second division match four months after his 48th birthday.
He was particularly prolific in guiding Japan to the 1998 World Cup, scoring 14 goals in qualifying, and last played for the national side in 2000.
His career, which started when he moved to Brazil to play youth football aged 15, is one of the longest in football history.

Article: The Local Government Information Unit said 94% of the 131 councils it spoke to were intending to put up bills, with their finances at "breaking point".
A third of these, 34% in total, intend to hike bills by more than 2% in April.
Councils, many of whom have frozen bills in recent years, say it will not be enough to plug the funding "gap" exacerbated by the cost of social care.
But the government says council tax is expected to be lower in real terms at the end of this Parliament than it was in 2010.
Although councils in Wales were included in the survey, the Welsh government has said it will not allow councils to raise bills to pay for social care.
Ministers say they are bringing forward money to help councils pay for social care by increasing the "precept" - a supplement that councils are able to charge on bills - from 2% to 5% over the next two years.
Years of cuts to central government funding since 2011 have put pressure on the budgets of the 375 councils in England and Wales, with many paring back core services. Financial pressures on county councils and unitary authorities that provide adult social care have become particularly acute in the past year.
Surrey County Council abandoned controversial plans this week to hold a referendum on a 15% rise in council tax which it said was needed to pay for social care. It will now increase bills by 4.99% - the maximum it can do without holding a public vote.
Labour have accused the government of doing a sweetheart deal with the Tory-controlled council to call off the referendum - claims it denies.
Publishing its research, the Local Government Information Unit said five district councils which do not provide social care had wanted to hold local referendums to sanction council tax rises above 2% but had "thought better" of it in recent weeks.
Inflation, as measured by the CPI index, currently stands at 1.6% but is projected to rise to 2.7% next year.
The LGIU said there was growing concern in town halls that the current system of funding local authorities - through a mixture of government grants, council tax and other income streams such as business rates and parking charges - would become unsustainable in the near future.
Of the 163 council chiefs - across 131 local authorities - which responded to its survey, 42% said future cuts would be "noticed" by residents while one in 10 feared the situation might become so serious that they would no longer be able to fulfil their councils' legal obligations to provide certain services.
A number of county councils - including Newcastle, North Tyneside, South Tyneside and Sunderland - have already said they will add the full 3% "social care precept" to council tax bills next year and many others are expected to follow suit.
Jonathan Carr-West, chief executive of the LGIU, said: "Local government finances are at breaking point."
"We see councils around the country patching their budgets by raising council tax, drawing on their reserves and increasing charging. They have very little confidence in the sustainability of the system.
"Councils are allowed to place a 3% precept on council tax to fund adult social care - nine out of 10 of them saying it is not enough money and won't meet the gap. Councils are going to retain 100% of the new business rates - half of councils tell us they think they will be worse off under that new system post-2020."
He said councils were being frustrated in their efforts to address the problems themselves with revenue-raising measures such as greater scope for charging, local hotel taxes and a re-evaluation of council tax bands "off the government's agenda".
"None of these are wild and wacky ideas. They are things that are done in other countries, in the US, France and Spain and they work.
"Here they are not even part of the conversation. That needs to change."
A spokesman for the Department of Communities and Local Government said: "Council tax is expected to be lower in real terms at the end of this Parliament than it was in 2010 and we've protected residents by allowing them to veto excessive rises at a local referendum.
"Our historic four-year funding settlement gives local authorities the certainty they need to plan ahead, with almost £200bn available to provide the services that local people most value.
"We've also announced an additional £900m for social care, meaning councils will have £7.6bn of dedicated funding to spend over the four years."

Article: The security forces are reported to have used tear gas against stone-throwing protesters.
They also surrounded the hometown of Burhan Wani, 22, who was killed fighting Indian troops last year.
Separately seven people are reported to have been killed in shelling across the Line of Control that divides Indian and Pakistani-administered Kashmir.
Officials on the Pakistani side told Reuters that five people died in Indian shelling, while Indian officials say two people were killed by Pakistani fire.
There has been an armed revolt in the Muslim-majority region against rule by India since 1989, although violence has waned in recent years.
The disputed region is claimed by both India and Pakistan in its entirety. India blames Pakistan for fuelling the unrest, a claim denied by Islamabad.
Burhan Wani is credited with reviving the image of militancy in Muslim-majority Indian-administered Kashmir, becoming a figurehead for young people.
Saturday's violence started as people tried to walk to his home in Tral - where he died in a shootout with the army last July.
His death led to a wave of protests during which dozens of people were killed.

Article: A Leave vote was always seen as more likely to generate significant disturbances in the financial world.
For that reason it is also the result which was thought more likely to pose a headache for the world's central banks.
There have already been statements from some that they are prepared to act to maintain financial stability.
There are two potential issues they might want to respond to in the short term: the stability of the (commercial) banks and swings in exchange rates.
With the banks there is a possibility of a general rise in risk aversion, and some might have difficulty borrowing in the inter-bank market. The ultimate danger from that is that they might be unable to make debt payments as they come due.
Central banks can address that by lending them extra money (liquidity). In the UK the Bank of England has already been doing this ahead of the referendum, hoping to ensure that there is sufficient liquidity already in place. The Bank has said it "will continue to monitor market conditions carefully and keep its operations under review".
Other central banks will be ready to take similar action if they think it's needed.
What if the strains show up in terms of foreign currency liquidity - say an Italian bank needing quick access to Swiss francs?
There are arrangements known as swap lines put in place during the international financial crisis that can be used if necessary. The Italian bank could then get Swiss francs from the European Central Bank (ECB), (and the Swiss National Bank would be able to offer euros to Swiss banks if needed). The Bank of England is involved in these arrangements so it can get foreign currency if British banks were to need it urgently.
With sharp moves in exchange rates, there are several options. They could just live with it. But if they felt the swings were too sharp and destabilising they could intervene using their foreign currency reserves.
In the case of the UK, the decision to conduct such intervention is for the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, with the Bank of England carrying it out in the markets.
So if there were too precipitous a fall in the value of one currency (sterling would be the obvious candidate in the event of a leave vote) the Bank of England could buy sterling with dollars or yen from its reserves, hoping the additional demand for the pound would support its value.
Conversely the Swiss National Bank has been worried about too rapid a rise in the Swiss franc and has already been into the markets to buy other currencies such as the euro with its own national currency.
Further action on these lines is a possibility. Currencies seen as havens are susceptible to unwanted sharp rises in times of financial stress and the Swiss franc is a prime example of that.
Currency market intervention is often not announced. Some observers say there is evidence suggesting that the Swiss central bank might have intervened over the past week.  The intervention after the vote by the SNB was announced however.
Interest rates can also be used to curb currency moves - a cut to stop a currency rising; a rate rise to prevent a fall.
Both options, interest rate moves and intervention, can be co-ordinated by central banks.
Further quantitative easing (QE) is also a possible response to a rising currency. It tends to drive down market interest rates and there has been some speculation that it might be on the agenda very soon,  perhaps from the Bank of Japan (which does not want to see the yen gaining value).
Interest rate moves and QE can also be used to address longer term fallout - to tackle any impact on inflation or growth. The Bank of England has scope to cut rates further and it could undertake further QE. A fall in sterling would be inflationary, though up to a point that could be welcome as inflation is currently (at 0.3%) far below the Bank's target (2%).
Another risk is that in a general flight from riskier assets the government debt problem in the eurozone could return, pushing up borrowing costs for countries such as Spain and Italy that were in the firing line a few years ago.
Those earlier eurozone storms abated after the ECB announced that it was prepared in some circumstances to buy the bonds, the debts, of governments severely affected. In the event it never used this new weapon. The mere threat of doing so was enough to settle the eurozone bond market.
Some observers, such as the London consultancy Capital Economics, think it could finally use this programme, if the aftermath of a leave vote were sufficiently disruptive.
The likely timescale for these options varies.  In principle many could be done very quickly. The most urgent, if needed, would probably be bank liquidity. Interest rates and QE could be announced early, but could also be used as a response to economic fallout that might emerge over a longer period.
The ECB's option of riding to the rescue of the likes of Spain or Italy would take some time. They would need to have an economic policy programme agreed with the rest of the eurozone. And Spain in particular, with an election this weekend, is itself in a period of political uncertainty that could make it difficult to conduct international negotiations.

Article: In 2015/16, 93.3% of youngsters were in a "positive destination" three months after leaving high school. That was up from 93% in 2014/15.
The Scottish government figures also showed that those taking up training was 2.6%, down from 3.8% in 2014/15.
The data is based on what happened to 52,249 pupils in S4 to S6 attending council-run and grant aided schools.
Minister for Further and Higher Education and Science, Shirley-Anne Somerville, said the statistics showed that the government was making real progress in enabling young people in Scotland to realise "their full potential".
She added: "It is especially encouraging to note that the proportion of school leavers in our most deprived areas going on to a positive destination is at a record high.
"I am also pleased to note that the proportion of school leavers going directly into higher education has reached its highest ever level."
The statistics also showed that from the 20% least deprived areas of Scotland, 96.6% of former pupils were in a "positive destination". That is up from 95.1% in 2011/12.
When looking at the 20% most deprived areas, the data shows that 88.7% of former pupils continued in education, got a job or secured training - that is up by 0.2% on 2014/15 and up by 4.8% on 2011/12.
At a local authority level Glasgow (89.9% of 4,551 pupils) and Clackmannanshire (90.2% of 489 pupils) had the lowest percentage of pupils going on to "positive destinations" while Na h-Eileanan Siar (97.6% of 248 pupils) and East Dunbartonshire (97.5% of 1,368 pupils) had the highest percentages.

The Herald also published a 5am edition. The paper said: "Sturgeon triumphant as Labour humiliated."
"Victory's at hand" was the earlier headline in The National, with a full page picture of Nicola Sturgeon with her husband and SNP chief executive Peter Murrell. The paper said she was "on course to win her mandate".
"Just Like Nat" was the headline on the front page of the Scottish Sun. Earlier, shortly after the polls closed, the newspaper tweeted that the Tories would "comfortably" seal second place.

The Scottish Daily Express said Nicola Sturgeon had been warned that there would be "no more excuses" for failing to deliver for Scotland as the SNP "swept to an historic third term" in the Holyrood election.
The Daily Star headline was "Five more years". It also predicted the SNP was poised to "hold Holyrood".
The Scottish Daily Mail had published three editions by 03:00. Its most recent said "SNP set for victory, Tory vote surges in push for second and Labour disaster as seats tumble".

Article: Tawel Fan ward at Glan Clwyd Hospital, Denbighshire, was closed more than three years ago and a report found some patients were treated like animals.
It has emerged that at least seven patients' families were told treatment may have contributed to their deaths.
Betsi Cadwaladr health board said an investigation was under way.
It acknowledged the quality of care provided could have been a contributory factor to the deaths of some patients.
A review of mortality rates on the ward has never been published although it is understood it has been completed.
Relatives of one patient told BBC Wales Today they were told medical care on the ward was inadequate.
Correspondence seen by the programme included an apology from the health board to the family, who do not want to be identified.
One letter said: "Experts found that there were problems in the health care which may have contributed to the death."
It added that "the board is very much engaged in a thorough search for the truth about the Tawel Fan ward".
But the family were unconvinced lessons had been learned and said questions remained unanswered and, as far as they were aware, nobody had lost their job, let alone be prosecuted.
The scandal of Tawel Fan pushed the already troubled health board into close supervision by the Welsh Government.
It remains in special measures which costs Â£5m a year.
An initial report into what happened at Tawel Fan was published almost three years ago. Two more reports are due later this year.
One of them, being compiled by the Health and Social Care Advisory Service (Hascas), is expected to include details of a mortality review of Tawel Fan patients.
But Geoff Ryall-Harvey, who leads the patient watchdog Community Health Council in north Wales, said it should be released as soon as possible.
"It may stop this practice elsewhere," he added.
A Betsi Cadwaladr health board spokesman said: "We acknowledge that the quality of care provided could have been a contributory factor to the death of some patients.
"Whether this is the case will be established as part of the independent Hascas investigation, which is currently being carried out.
"In order to establish whether or not the quality of care contributed to any patients' death, every aspect of every patient's care has to be investigated.
"This is a complicated and time consuming process, but must be carried out in order to determine whether or not the care provided was a contributory factor to any patients' death.
"Every family involved in the investigation will receive an individual report detailing the care provided to their relative. These reports will also help inform the findings of the Tawel Fan investigation."

Article: The Conservatives have been given a huge confidence boost and will feel in a position to challenge in more constituencies next year, rather than just on the list.
At the party's weekly press briefing, I asked the Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies, who was elected on the list, whether he'd stand as a constituency candidate in his home turf of the Vale of Glamorgan but he said he hadn't thought about it.
Presumably those are the kind of decisions they will now feel more confident contemplating.
The party will also have a huge amount of new data on voters which it'll be able to call upon and the belief that campaigning hard on the NHS helped the Tories cross the line in places like the Vale of Clwyd and Gower.
The Conservatives feel it's them, rather than any of the other opposition parties, who have become the repository of votes from those who are disaffected by the state of the NHS.
Welsh Labour are going to hold a "short sharp" analysis into what went wrong.
Carwyn Jones was in line with most of the criticism of Ed Miliband when he told AMs that the party needed to appeal to small business owners who are not millionaires but who work hard.
What will be more difficult is countering the argument on the NHS, which the former minister Alun Davies believes is already lost.
Another potential difficulty for Welsh Labour will be dealing with unhappiness within the party over council re-organisation.
Bernie Attridge, the deputy leader of Flintshire Council, has tweeted saying the party needs to be careful on local government reform if it wants to retain the support of grassroots councillors.
It also seems to have been the case that Labour lost more votes to UKIP than the Conservatives, which is another challenge to overcome.
But Labour will at least have the advantage that it will be David Cameron, and not Ed Miliband, carrying out the latest round of public sector cuts that are likely to take effect sooner rather than later.
The question is whether Carwyn Jones is going to be able to turn that to his advantage when his own record in government will be under scrutiny.
Plaid Cymru's education spokesman, Simon Thomas, also in the party's weekly press briefing, said he believed Leanne Wood could portray herself as an alternative first minister because of the way she emotionally connected with people in the campaign.
The party now has a year to make that a credible proposition after it failed to gain any new seats and came fourth, behind UKIP, in the overall share of the vote, despite her unprecedented profile.
He also said that on the campaign trail people wanted to know what Plaid was going to do about the NHS and that people "did not see the strengths" of its arguments.
The Welsh Liberal Democrats are still licking their wounds but in a "je ne regrette rien" moment, the leader Kirsty Williams said she had no regrets over the coalition.
She has admitted the party failed to communicate what they were standing for. It will now hold a series of meetings across Wales as it tries to rally members for an election that it'll be able to fight unshackled of being in coalition government which was clearly a burden to many of them.

Article: Government limits to teachers' pay and "real terms cuts" to school budgets risk undermining standards, they warn.
"Teachers need a pay rise," they urge, in a joint statement to the School Teachers' Review Body (STRB), which sets their pay.
The government said it was attracting "the best and brightest" to teaching.
Teachers' pay increases have been limited to 1% or less for the past five years, and the government aims to keep to this limit for the next four years.
With long, hard working hours and a relatively low starting salary for a graduate, it is hardly surprising that teacher recruitment is struggling.
Qualified teachers in England can expect to start on Â£22,000 outside London or Â£27,000 in inner London.
In most cases, this is after post-graduate training, a year's school placement and a degree course.
And although there is room for growth and progression - based on performance of course - many newly-qualified teachers find the pressures of the job too much and leave soon after taking their first post.
Teachers in England have some of the longest hours and largest classes in the developed world, says the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
Teaching unions have complained that although their staff were promised a 1% pay rise, this has had to be found from within existing school budgets.
Head teachers say school budgets are already at breaking point as they struggle to deal with other inflationary pressures.
But the DfE maintains new trainees can benefit from financial support, a good salary, enviable job security and a generous pension.
In October, England's education secretary, Nicky Morgan, wrote to the STRB to remind them of this policy.
But the joint statement warns that "as pay and prospects improve in comparable occupations", further pressure will be placed on teacher recruitment and retention.
This means more children will be taught by teachers who are not specialist in the subjects they teach, it adds.
With budgets "at breaking point", schools will struggle to maintain current spending - "let alone afford pay increases", it continues.
"The government must fully fund the necessary pay increases for teachers and school leaders in both England and Wales."
The six unions are:
Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, described four more years of pay austerity as a "false economy".
Kevin Courtney, deputy general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said teachers "are already leaving in droves and new graduates looking elsewhere for a career".
Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, claimed 160,000 more teachers would be needed over three years to cope with a rapid increase in pupil numbers.
But she warned unless the picture improved the government would have little chance of meeting this target.
"Schools will have to start increasing class sizes or shutting courses and cutting the subject options available to pupils".
And Elaine Edwards, UCAC's general secretary urged the government to reconsider its pay policies "for the sake of our children and young people and the education system as a whole".
The STRB is expected to make its recommendations on teachers' pay in April.
A Department for Education spokeswoman said it had worked with the profession to "raise the status of teaching", adding that that a record number of highly-qualified graduates and "experienced career changers" were now teaching.
She added: "But we are determined to go further, and recognise that some schools find it harder to recruit the teachers they need, which is why we are expanding the great Teach First and Schools Direct programmes and we are launching the National Teaching Service, which will mean more great teachers in schools in every corner of the country."

Article: Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford said the idea was "attractive" and could help tackle poverty and inequality.
Supporters said it would help unemployed people who fear taking a job would lead to cuts in their benefits.
But Patrick Minford from Cardiff University's Business School said it was "not a workable scheme".
Under Universal Basic Income (UBI) everyone would receive the same sum of money regardless of whether they work or not.
There would be no requirements to show an individual is looking for a job either.
In Scotland the policy has support from across the political spectrum, with feasibility work under way ahead of possible pilot schemes in Glasgow and Fife.
Jamie Cooke, head of the RSA think tank in Scotland, told the BBC's Sunday Politics Wales programme: "Moving from a system where you aren't working to a system where you are, you won't face those penalties, you retain your consistent payment.
"You're given the security to be able to choose to work... or training, or to set up your own business in a way that is beneficial to you."
However Prof Minford, who was an adviser to former prime minister Margaret Thatcher, told the programme: "This is not a workable scheme because it's far too expensive.
"It creates a tremendous tax, a disincentive for the average person further up the income scale who's paying for it all."
Mr Drakeford told the assembly earlier in January he found the idea of UBI "attractive in the way that it can simplify and support people who currently have to rely on a very complex set of part-time work, part-time benefits and so on".
But he added: "The political world will face a job of convincing the public about the merits of the scheme."
Asked if he was worried by Mr Drakeford's comments, Prof Minford replied: "It's quite worrying for Wales.
"I'm hoping Wales won't go the same way [as Scotland] towards this sort of extremely expensive socialist experiment".

Article: The British Transport Police said the move was a "proportionate response" in the face of a mounting terrorism threat.
Specially trained officers will begin carrying the stun weapons over the next few weeks.
It brings the Scottish force into line with their counterpart in England, where Tasers have been used since 2011.
The weapons are used to incapacitate suspects through the use of an electric current.
Temporary Assistant Chief Constable Alun Thomas said: "This decision is not based on specific intelligence of any criminal behaviour or imminent threat, but will allow us the option to deploy Taser devices where, in the course of their duty, an officer needs to protect the public or themselves by using force.
"The current threat to the UK from international terrorism remains'severe', meaning an attack is highly likely.
"Recent terrorist attacks across the world are a stark reminder that the threat from terrorism is a genuine risk, and it is important that we keep our security measures and operational tactics under constant review."
Officers south of the border fired the Tasers eight times during 2015, according to a reply to recent Freedom of Information request to the force.
In one instance, police used a weapon against a man armed with a large knife - a move which "undoubtedly" prevented people from being hurt, according to Mr Thomas.
He said: "In our assessment, the introduction of Taser devices in Scotland is a proportionate response and provides an additional option for our officers to consider when confronted with a genuine threat to themselves or the public.
"By way of example, in December last year, police deployed a Taser device against a man armed with a large bladed knife, preventing him cutting the throat of stranger who he had targeted at random at Leytonstone station, east London.
"Undoubtedly the use of the Taser device in this incident prevented even further harm to the travelling public."
"We believe that the public in Scotland deserve the same level of protection as people elsewhere on the rail network."
British Transport Police said they reached the decision on Tasers following "detailed discussions" with Police Scotland.
Scottish Ministers have also been briefed.
The force refused to reveal how many officers would receive the training required to carry Tasers "for security reasons".
Ch Supt John McBride, divisional commander for the Scotland, said Taser use by officers would be monitored.
"Every time we unholster it, it will be subject to review," he told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme.
"It will be subject to internal review by our own specialists, but also we have agreed with the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner that where there is a discharge and serious incidents involving Taser then we will refer ourselves to the Pirc for them to review the circumstances of the case and if necessary carry out an investigation."

Article: For 70 years, my father has lived with the shame of what happened to his ship, HMS Hebe, in June 1940.
During the evacuation of Dunkirk, he was the chief engine room artificer on board the Hebe, a minesweeper deployed to Dover as a control vessel.
The Hebe crossed the Channel to Dunkirk three times during those chaotic days between 27 May and 4 June.
"It was torrid, dangerous and nerve-wracking with all-day long German air attacks", says Harold Biles who marked his 28th birthday during the height of the bombardment.
"The Hebe was lying about 200 metres off the beach at Dunkirk, and there was just a seething mass of soldiers. All we knew was that we were on the water, they were on the beach and were trying to get to us.
"There was constant bombing and shellfire.  We just used to wait for nightfall when there was a relaxation, and we could perhaps get some sleep."
In the early hours of 29 May 1940, the captain of HMS Hebe sent a gig ashore to the beach at Dunkirk. It was to collect Lord John Gort, the commander-in- chief of the British Expeditionary Force and take him to England.
"As we sped back to Dover, I remember seeing Lord Gort standing in the waist of the ship, holding the guardrail to offset the rise and swell of the waves. He was resplendent in his red-trimmed uniform, but he was motionless, with his head sunk to his chest".
"It was not for him to receive any acclaim for the evacuation of some 330,000 men and saving them from Nazi POW camps. In his eyes, there was only defeat. He had lost an army."
The German bombardment, the trauma and the fatigue were taking a toll on the crew of HMS Hebe, and no doubt other ships involved in the evacuation.
My father describes how on the morning of 1 June, he witnessed the first signs of what we now know to be post-traumatic stress, but in those days was sometimes referred to as a "lack of moral fibre".
"We were embarking more stores and ammunition back in Dover. An RAF plane flying low overhead was the starting point. A seaman looked up, screamed and fell into convulsions with hysteria. It was contagious and he was joined by three or four others.
"Later in the day an order was issued, amazing and ill judged. Anybody feeling the stress of the last week was told to leave the ship and assemble on the dockside in preparation for going to hospital.
"About 20 men left the ship and I can still see their grins as they trooped over the gangway. The majority were malingerers but in fairness, the prospect of that final trip was frightening as the Germans were almost on the French beaches."
The captain of the Hebe sent for Harold Biles as the Chief Engineer, and the Coxswain.
"We both had to tell him that the ship was so depleted of crew that a further sailing was impossible. And so we remained alongside while other craft made the trip, some never to return."
To my father's dismay, HMS Hebe played no further part in Operation Dynamo.
"This was the greatest blow which sometimes I feel to this day," he says, on the eve of his 98th birthday.

The Conservatives feel it's them, rather than any of the other opposition parties, who have become the repository of votes from those who are disaffected by the state of the NHS.
Welsh Labour are going to hold a "short sharp" analysis into what went wrong.
Carwyn Jones was in line with most of the criticism of Ed Miliband when he told AMs that the party needed to appeal to small business owners who are not millionaires but who work hard.
What will be more difficult is countering the argument on the NHS, which the former minister Alun Davies believes is already lost.
Another potential difficulty for Welsh Labour will be dealing with unhappiness within the party over council re-organisation.
Bernie Attridge, the deputy leader of Flintshire Council, has tweeted saying the party needs to be careful on local government reform if it wants to retain the support of grassroots councillors.
It also seems to have been the case that Labour lost more votes to UKIP than the Conservatives, which is another challenge to overcome.
But Labour will at least have the advantage that it will be David Cameron, and not Ed Miliband, carrying out the latest round of public sector cuts that are likely to take effect sooner rather than later.
The question is whether Carwyn Jones is going to be able to turn that to his advantage when his own record in government will be under scrutiny.
Plaid Cymru's education spokesman, Simon Thomas, also in the party's weekly press briefing, said he believed Leanne Wood could portray herself as an alternative first minister because of the way she emotionally connected with people in the campaign.
The party now has a year to make that a credible proposition after it failed to gain any new seats and came fourth, behind UKIP, in the overall share of the vote, despite her unprecedented profile.
He also said that on the campaign trail people wanted to know what Plaid was going to do about the NHS and that people "did not see the strengths" of its arguments.
The Welsh Liberal Democrats are still licking their wounds but in a "je ne regrette rien" moment, the leader Kirsty Williams said she had no regrets over the coalition.
She has admitted the party failed to communicate what they were standing for. It will now hold a series of meetings across Wales as it tries to rally members for an election that it'll be able to fight unshackled of being in coalition government which was clearly a burden to many of them.

Another election is probably the last thing the public want to hear about after what we've just gone through but that's exactly what the parties at the assembly are gearing up for next year.

Article: Helio Hermito Zampier Neto, a 31-year-old defender for Chapecoense, was in a stable condition, doctors said, after surgery on a lung, a knee, a wrist and his head.
Five other people survived the crash, which killed 71 people.
Colombian officials say evidence is growing that the plane ran out of fuel.
Miguel Quiroga, the pilot of the British-made Avro RJ85 aircraft, had been warned by an official at Santa Cruz airport, in Bolivia, where the plane took off, that he might not have enough fuel, Bolivian Deber newspaper said.
But, despite the official's concerns, he went ahead with the flight to Medellin. The country's authorities have not yet commented.
In a leaked tape, the pilot can be heard warning of a "total electric failure" and "lack of fuel".
The flight missed a planned refuelling stop in Cobija, on the border between Brazil and Bolivia, because the airport did not operate at night, Brazil's O Globo newspaper reported.
The pilot had the option to refuel in Bogota, it said, but headed straight to Medellin.
Bolivia's President Evo Morales said he would take "drastic measures" to determine who was responsible for the crash. On Thursday, the country's aviation authority suspended the operating licence of charter airline LaMia, which was part-owned by the pilot and two other aviation officials.
Colombian police released a video (in Spanish) with the moment crew member Erwin Tumiri was rescued alive. It showed him conscious, screaming for his colleagues. He is in hospital and reports in local media suggest he may be discharged this weekend.
The other crew member who survived, Ximena Suarez, was said to be in good condition in hospital. The four other survivors were still in intensive care.
Neto's father, Helam, said on Facebook that news of his recovery was giving the family "renewed hope and faith".
"My son is getting better and better. He has just undergone surgery on his leg and doctors say he will return to football," he said.
"We shall continue praying because we still need his discharge from hospital to see him closely."
Doctors said 24-year-old goalkeeper Jakson Ragnar Follmann would not lose his left leg, after having his right one amputated.
Defender Alan Ruschel, 27, had spinal surgery, but his movements were not affected, they added.
Journalist Rafael Henzel was listed as stable.
The bodies of the Brazilian victims were flown out of Medellin on Friday. Many of the victims were players and staff of Chapecoense, who were due to play in the final of the Copa Sudamericana against Medellin team Atletico Nacional.
In the squad's home town of Chapeco, in southern Brazil, temporary structures have been set up in the football stadium for an open-air wake on Saturday. Some 100,000 people are expected to attend.
The plane's flight recorders are to be examined in the UK. A full investigation into the crash is expected to take months.

Article: "I'm OK with myself, I sleep pretty good at night," Casey Anthony told the Associated Press, adding that she does not care "what anyone thinks about me".
The 30-year-old complained about her portrayal in the media as a partying child-killer.
Anthony was convicted of lying to police but acquitted of murder.
Casey Anthony: The case that gripped the US
If found guilty she could have faced the death penalty under Florida law.
"My sentence was doled out long before there was a verdict. Sentence first, verdict afterward," she said.
"People found me guilty long before I had my day in court."
The 2011 case drew millions of viewers across the US, with every twist covered on live television.
Anthony was dubbed "America's most hated mom" amid reports she went to nightclubs and got a tattoo in the month her daughter was missing.
Last week the former judge that presided over the case spoke out to say that Anthony "more than likely" accidently killed her daughter by using too much chloroform to calm her before suffocating her with duct tape.
During the trial, her defence argued that the girl drowned in the pool, and that Anthony and her father covered it up.
The government failed to secure a conviction due to the lack of physical evidence tying her to Caylee's death.
When asked about the drowning defence, Anthony hesitated.
"Everyone has their theories, I don't know. As I stand here today I can't tell you one way or another.
"The last time I saw my daughter I believed she was alive and was going to be OK, and that's what was told to me."
She added: "Caylee would be 12 right now. And would be a total badass."

Article: The 70-year-old Time Team presenter joined anti-tunnel campaigners to fight the plans, saying they placed the area's wider archaeology at risk.
The protest by the Stonehenge Alliance was staged outside a consultation event in London earlier.
Highways England said it was working to find "the best solution possible".
The public consultation on its plans for putting the A303 into a 1.8-mile (2.9km) dual carriageway tunnel runs until 5 March.
Highways England says the move would cut congestion and improve journey times.
The scheme has the backing of English Heritage and the National Trust.
Speaking outside the Society of Antiquaries at Burlington House, Robinson suggested a longer tunnel.
He said: "I think the proposal we are being offered is a really old-fashioned one.
"It assumes what needs to be protected is that little clump of stones."
He said it was only over the past three decades archaeologists had begun to comprehend the wider significance of the site.
"That's a high-class Wiltshire Disneyland experience," he said.
"Once it's gone, we'll never get that back.
"If you were going to protect Buckingham Palace, you wouldn't put a tunnel in halfway down the Mall."
The Stonehenge Alliance wants other options to reduce traffic to be fully explored.
Spokeswoman Dr Kate Fielden said: "We want a genuine consultation with real choice.
"Both of Highways England's options involve huge and damaging new roadworks gouged into our most important ancient landscape."
A spokesman for Highways England said: "We fully understand the cultural heritage of the site and one of the broad objectives of the scheme is to help conserve and enhance the World Heritage Site by removing the sight and sound of traffic and make it easier to reach and explore."

Article: Pick, 21, and Bateman, 25, were caught with anabolic steroids in their systems during out-of-competition tests.
Both players have been suspended from all sport until December 2016.
"The players perhaps thought they had a better chance of getting away with it as it was pre-season," UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) head of science and medicine Nick Wojek told BBC Sport.
"The benefits for rugby players, in both codes, are clear with these kinds of substances. They also allow for a quicker recovery from training sessions or from injuries.
Wojek says that UKAD are taking greater steps to deter players from rugby league and union from taking banned substances.
Last week Neath back-row Lee Evans was banned for two years after he was found to have taken the anabolic steroid drostanolone - although UKAD director Graham Arthur said there was some evidence to support Evans's claim that he had not knowingly taken the banned substance.
"The rewards are potentially very big for players outside the top level attempting to obtain lucrative contracts and there is also an image issue to contend with," Wojek added.
"We are implementing a visible testing program and working with governing bodies to ensure that education strategies are in place within clubs.
"We're also looking to educate players in academies and at school level on the morals of taking banned substances."
Wales international three-quarter Bateman is the club's longest-serving player and signed a contract extension at the third tier side in October 2014.
Scorpions chairman Ian Curzon said: "It is hoped that he will return from this ban both a better person and a better player."
Featherstone forward Pick was a member of the Rovers team that lost 36-12 against Leigh Centurions in the 2014 Championship Grand Final but he has not played this season.
A statement issued by the West Yorkshire club said: "Featherstone Rovers are fully committed to the sport's anti-doping policy and players are educated by the club and governing body as to the penalties they could incur should a positive test be recorded."

Article: The Toffees, back in the tournament for the first time since 2010, controlled much of the game as a Ricardo Rodriguez own goal and a Seamus Coleman header gave them a 2-0 half-time lead.
Leighton Baines put the game beyond Wolfsburg with a second-half penalty.
Kevin Mirallas drilled in a late fourth for Everton before Rodriguez grabbed a consolation with a curled free-kick.
The win puts Everton top of Group H and was just reward for manager Roberto Martinez, who underlined his intention to take the competition seriously by naming a strong side, after calling it "the perfect next step" for the club.
The Toffees narrowly missed out on the Champions League last season as they finished fifth in the Premier League, but with their participation in this season's Europa League ending a four-year absence, Martinez has expressed a determination to go as far as possible.
Everton's attacking display on Thursday will certainly give him confidence of progressing from a group that also contains French side Lille and Russians FK Krasnodar.
Martinez had opted not to rest any of his first-team regulars for the visit of Wolfsburg, naming the same side that defeated West Brom 2-0 in the Premier League on Saturday.
Romelu Lukaku got his first of the campaign in that game and the striker spearheaded an exciting, attacking quartet that also included Aiden McGeady, Naismith and Mirallas.
They have all contributed to Everton's impressive statistic of having scored at least two goals in every game this season, and it was of little surprise they each played significant roles in the goals against Wolfsburg.
Naismith was the first to make a telling contribution, forcing the opener with Everton's first attack. After winning possession, Naismith ran into the area to receive a Baines pass before stabbing a shot at goal. Rodriguez tried to clear, but the ball cannoned off goalkeeper Diego Benaglio, and hit the Wolfsburg full-back again before ending up in his own net.
That was Everton's first goal in Europe at Goodison Park since beating Sporting Lisbon 2-1 in February 2010, and it had the buoyant home crowd hungry for more.
Everton duly attempted to deliver, with full-backs Baines and Coleman becoming more adventurous as Wolfsburg offered little going forward, and their attacking instincts resulted in the home side's second goal on the stroke of half-time.
Mirallas's drive was weakly pushed into the path of Baines, who had followed the shot into the area, and he knocked the ball across goal for Coleman to nod in.
Wolfsburg boss Dieter Hecking introduced Germany midfielder Aaron Hunt for the start of the second half, but within seconds of the restart Everton went further ahead. This time, Robin Knoche's foul on McGeady was deemed to have occurred inside the area, and Baines confidently despatched the resulting penalty.
The goal effectively ended Wolfsburg's hopes of returning to Germany with anything to show but, with nothing to lose, they embarked on a spell of dominance.
For a good 30 minutes they enjoyed the lion's share of possession and attempts on goal, as Tim Howard produced saves from Luiz Gustavo's opportunistic shot and Rodriguez's well-struck free-kick.
Former Arsenal striker Nicklas Bendtner was introduced after the hour, with Wolfsburg boss Hecking sensing a possible goal, but instead it was Everton who grabbed a fourth. Mirallas peeled away from defenders to run on to substitute Samuel Eto'o's through ball and he coolly slotted in at Benaglio's near post.
There was still time for Wolfsburg to get the consolation their 27 shots on goal deserved, Rodriguez making some amends for his early own goal with a curling free-kick.
Everton boss Roberto Martinez: "The atmosphere was perfect for us to start a very good performance.
"I thought there were two very good sides. On the night the scoreline probably doesn't reflect the difference between the two sides.
"We scored at the right times. Our work-rate was magnificent. We had to defend and we did that really well but every time we went forward we had a clinical touch about us."
Wolfsburg boss Dieter Hecking: "It's obviously not the start we'd hoped for. We were lacking in certain areas, both in terms of finishing and defensive work.
"We should have gone into half-time a goal down and we got hit with a second just before the break. Straight after the restart, 3-0 down and the game is lost.
"We really weren't smart enough and showed a certain naivety."

Article: Supporters of new President Mohammed Mursi are in a stand-off with generals who have ruled since President Hosni Mubarak was ousted last year.
Speaking after talks with Mr Mursi, Mrs Clinton said the situation required "compromise and real politics".
She also praised Egypt's military council for its interim leadership.
Mr Mursi, of the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, was elected in June in the country's first freely contested leadership vote.
'Prevent confrontation'
The hour-long meeting between President Mursi and Mrs Clinton was described by a US official as candid and cordial.
By Kim GhattasBBC News, Cairo
Hillary Clinton wanted to come to Egypt soon after the elections because the US believes it is important to engage with President Mursi early on. The meeting was described by officials as good and candid but this is still a tentative relationship, not a full embrace.
The US administration is slowly feeling its way in the region, learning to work with groups that Washington has shunned in the past.
When Condoleezza Rice was here in 2005 as US Secretary of State, she was categorical - the US would not engage with the Muslim Brotherhood. But in the new Arab world, long-held American assumptions about who is a friend or not have been shattered. And new problems have emerged.
Outside Mrs Clinton's hotel, dozens of Egyptians protested against Mr Mursi and continued US military aid to Egypt under his presidency with slogans like: "We don't want Hamas to rule Egypt."
Afterwards, Mrs Clinton told reporters: "I have come to Cairo to reaffirm the strong support of the United States for the Egyptian people and their democratic transition.
"We want to be a good partner and we want to support the democracy that has been achieved by the courage and sacrifice of the Egyptian people."
The BBC's Jon Leyne in Cairo says that for all the US fears of an Islamist takeover in recent decades, the governments in Washington and Egypt have now realised they need each other.
Mr Mursi and the Muslim Brotherhood are particularly keen to avoid the sort of international isolation that has been so damaging to other Islamist governments after they have taken office, our correspondent adds.
Saturday's talks launched a series of high-level meetings aimed at stabilising Egypt's fledgling democracy and its alliance with the US.
Mr Mursi has tried to defuse a row over parliament - a body he tried to reinstate by decree last weekend.
The chamber, dominated by Mr Mursi's Islamist allies, was shut down by the military before he took power. The Supreme Constitutional Court has said the dissolution is final.
Mr Mursi says he is "committed to the rulings of Egyptian judges and very keen to manage state powers and prevent any confrontation".
Mrs Clinton said she would meet the head of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (Scaf), Field Marshal Mohammed Hussein Tantawi, on Sunday.
He became the country's interim ruler after the fall of President Hosni Mubarak in February last year.
Mrs Clinton praised the role played by the military, but said she would make clear to Field Marshal Tantawi that the US supports the return of the armed forced "to a purely military role".
The secretary of state also encouraged President Mursi to live up to his promises to protect the rights of women and minorities, and to preserve the peace treaty with Israel.
Mrs Clinton arrived in Egypt from a week-long trip to Asia, and will later visit Israel.

Article: Diabetes UK Cymru says there are now 177,212 people in Wales living with the condition.
It said if the trend continues these figures could rise to 288,000 by 2025.
Launching Diabetes Week, the charity said a lack of education on managing the condition had led to "devastating" health complications, including amputations, blindness and strokes.
According to the charity, many cases of type 2 diabetes can be prevented but there is no way of preventing type 1.
Diabetes costs NHS Wales nearly Â£500m a year, it added.
Diabetes UK Cymru's director Dai Williams said: "Over the last decade we have seen the number of people with diabetes rising at an alarming rate and these latest figures are a stark call to action.
"We must act now or face the very real danger of diabetes devastating the lives of even more people, and threatening to wreck the already over-burdened NHS."

Article: Labour MP Mrs Cox died when she was shot and stabbed in Birstall, West Yorkshire, on Thursday.
After her death, her friends set up a fundraising page, with proceeds to be divided between causes she had supported.
In a tweet, her husband Brendan said the money would "change lives".
The fund was pushed past the seven-figure mark shortly before 20:30 BST on Monday by a single £6,000 donation. More than 30,000 people have donated so far.
Money raised will support three charities Mr Cox said were close to his wife's heart - the Royal Voluntary Service, Hope not Hate and the White Helmets.
Mrs Cox's friend Tim Dixon, one of those who launched the fund, said: "The scale and speed of the public response to this fund has been overwhelming and deeply gratifying to Jo's family.
"It shows how powerfully Jo's story has moved so many. Jo would be so proud."
Gofundme, which hosts the appeal, said it was the largest UK campaign it had seen, and the third largest globally.
The fundraising milestone came after MPs gathered in the House of Commons on Monday to pay tribute to Mrs Cox as members of her family looked on.
Friends of Mrs Cox have announced plans for a public event in Trafalgar Square in London on Wednesday, on what would have been her 42nd birthday.
Mr Dixon said her husband Brendan was doing "an amazing job, and we're telling him that".
He said: "Over the weekend, he was thinking about how having kids just three and five years old, they're not going to have many memories of their mother when they grow up - he wants to capture those memories now.
"He had them write down special memories of mummy on pieces of paper, cut them out and hang them on the tree in his parents' garden."
The Batley and Spen MP died after she was attacked outside a library on her way to a constituency surgery.
Bernard Kenny, 77, was discharged from hospital on Monday night after he was stabbed in the stomach as he went to the aid of Mrs Cox.
A petition to the Cabinet Office calling for Mr Kenny to be awarded the George Cross has gained over 27,000 backers.
Rachel Collinson, who started the petition and is a Green Party spokesperson, said the move would "draw the nation together to celebrate rather than to give in to fear".
She said: "This man is a ray of light in a dark time, in a moment where the UK seems to be troubled by fear and division. This guy can be a beacon for all of us in what he did."
A Cabinet Office spokesman said: "The government is of course aware of the calls for Bernard Kenny to receive an honour and we will examine the evidence, which will then be considered by the honours committee to decide whether to recommend him for an honour."
Thomas Mair, 52, from Birstall, faces charges of murder, grievous bodily harm, possession of a firearm with intent to commit an indictable offence and possession of an offensive weapon in connection with the attack on Mrs Cox.

Article: According to Cancer Research UK some 41, 000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer every year, but 10,700 will die of the disease, making it the fourth most common cause of cancer death - and second only to lung cancer in men.
Given such a dire prognosis, and let's face it, given the financial profile of its victims, you might be forgiven for assuming that prostate cancer would be one of the most highly prioritised and well researched areas of oncology. Not a bit of it. Perhaps it's because men are squeamish, or don't like to talk about their health or visit the doctor, but prostate cancer has long been dubbed "the Cinderella cancer".
"We just don't make enough of it" according to consultant oncologist Professor Neil Burnet. "On the whole men are less vocal about their health, and older men tend to be even more stoical, preferring to grin and bear it. But it means men are poor advocates, and as a result prostate cancer has been overlooked".
Based at Addenbrooke's Hospital on the outskirts of Cambridge, Prof Burnet is trying to improve the targeting and efficiency of radiotherapy treatments, and to reduce toxicity in the healthy tissue surrounding the prostate. The technique, called Image Guided Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy Treatment uses imaging provided by a CT scan to target the tumour before a powerful but precisely shaped radiation dose is administered.
"What limits what we can do with radiotherapy are the side effects of the treatment, the toxicity.  And, since the prostate can move by up to a couple of centimetres from one day to the next, targeting the treatment is really important. The second half of this technology is in delivering intensity modulated radiotherapy, which allows us to match a higher dose of radiation to the shape of the tumour."
But if Image Guided IMRT offers the prospect of better outcomes for men with advanced or aggressive prostate cancer, how much better might it be to get in at an earlier stage?
That - at least in part - was the motivation behind the Collaborative Oncological Gene/Environment Study, or COGES, which has announced the discovery of 80 new genetic markers for breast, ovarian and prostate cancer. In one of the largest research projects of its kind scientists from Cambridge University and the Institute of Cancer Research in London looked at samples from more than 200,000 people - half with, and half without, cancer.
The results include 23 new gene variants associated with prostate cancer and 16 with aggressive forms of the disease. Initially at least that should help with the development of a viable screening test for the disease. In the longer term it may present new targets for drug treatment and better diagnosis, and a greater understanding of the mechanisms and basic biology of prostate cancer.
"It's shocking, but we still don't have an adequate screening test for prostate cancer," says Ros Eeles, Professor of Oncogenetics at the Institute of Cancer Research and COGES study leader on prostate cancer. "That's because the Prostate Specific Antigen, or PSA test, just isn't accurate enough and you'd have to treat between 12 and 48 men unnecessarily to save a single life. With this new information we could have a viable test in five to eight years".
If that still seems a long way off, surgical techniques have advanced dramatically when it comes to prostate cancer. These days consultant urologist Professor David Neal uses the DaVinci surgical robot to perform prostate surgery.
Sitting at a computer console that looks like it would be more at home in an amusement arcade than an operating theatre, Prof Neal can perform a prostatectomy without ever touching his patient. And because the robotic arms of the device (which looks a little like a crab hovering over the operating table) are much thinner than the surgeon's, and the grappling and cutting tools at the sharp end are much smaller, what was once a major operation is now less invasive.
As with Image Guided Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy collateral damage to surrounding healthy tissue is kept to a minimum.
"The DaVinci robot has made a huge difference to prostate surgery" says Prof Neal. "It's still a major operation, but we can be very precise about what we remove and the function we're able to save. That's got to be good news for the patient".

Article: RIT Capital announced it will not make a formal bid, after confirming reports last week that it was in the early stages of informal talks about merger.
Alliance Trust invests nearly Â£3bn worth of shareholder assets.
It will continue to face a fundamental review of what it does during this summer.
That could still lead to a sale, or outsourcing investment to other asset management firms. And following the review, it is still possible that a deal could be done with RIT.
But the announcement on Tuesday takes Alliance Trust out of the stock market's formal takeover and mergers procedures and oversight by the Takeover Panel.
Activist investors last year forced a change of strategy, aimed at reducing the discount of company value to underlying assets, which involved replacement of board members and chief executive Katherine Garrett-Cox.
A statement from RIT Capital said: "Following careful analysis and constructive discussions with representatives of Alliance Trust, RIT has concluded that it would not be in the best interests of its shareholders to make an offer for Alliance Trust and accordingly announces that it does not intend to make an offer to acquire Alliance Trust.
"The board of RIT respects the process which Alliance Trust are going through and wishes them well with their strategic review."
In response, the Alliance Trust statement said: "The board of Alliance Trust is implementing a series of changes to enhance shareholder value. This process is well under way and has already started to make good progress, lowering costs, narrowing the discount and allowing for the creation of a fully independent board of directors.
"This process of development continues and includes a strategic review of the group, encompassing a broad range of potential courses of action."
Alliance Trust was buying shares on the stock exchange on a daily basis, as part of its strategy to increase shareholder value. Its announcement stated that practice is to be stopped until the review is complete.

Article: It was three tries apiece in the first half, Wade scoring either side of Will Rowlands' try, with Josh Adams going over twice after Bryce Heem's score.
After Heem saw red for a tackle on Willie le Roux, Wasps' Alapati Leiua, Josh Bassett and Brendan Macken scored.
However, Biyi Alo and Jackson Willison crossed as Warriors gained two points.
The hosts also finished the match with 14 men, as ex-Warriors man Matt Mullan was sent to the sin-bin.
Second-bottom Worcester led on two occasions in the first half and were good value for their two bonus points.
New Zealander Heem was dismissed on 45 minutes for a mistimed challenge on airborne Wasps full-back Le Roux, who was replaced by Bassett after receiving treatment on the pitch.
Dai Young's side are now guaranteed a place in the end-of-season play-offs, while Warriors are nine points clear of Bristol and only four adrift of 10th-placed Sale.
Wasps director of rugby Dai Young:
"It's a win and five points but there were very few areas of our game that pleased me.
"Worcester won nearly all the 50-50s and were first to react in terms of mind and our performance didn't match the five points.
"Christian was probably the difference, but I always thought that we could respond if we needed to as we probably had that extra bit of quality.
"It was a big message to us as we will have to be better against Leinster next week as they will match us for quality so we'll have to prove that we've got the belly for the fight."
Worcester director of rugby Gary Gold:
"We knew we had to put in an incredibly strong performance and we showed huge character in an absolutely outstanding effort.
"We are a good team and improving but we want to keep our feet on the ground, although I believe we've turned the corner.
"We defended very well but we conceded two tries to Wade, who is a world class finisher. If you don't get him first time, you end up chasing shadows."

The attack, claimed by Islamic State (IS), was the deadliest in Tunisia since the uprising which led to the overthrow of long-serving ruler  Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali in 2011.
Over 20 people have been arrested in connection with the attack, although just two gunmen are thought to have carried out the raid.

Article: It said in a report that cuts had not been applied equally since 2010, with local authorities in the poorest areas seeing the biggest reductions.
The MPs warned further cuts could undermine councils' financial stability and threaten statutory services.
Local authority funding has been cut as part of efforts to tackle the deficit.
Most local authority funding in England comes from central government, with about a quarter of it raised through council tax.
Public spending watchdog the National Audit Office has said that by 2016 local authority funding will have been cut in real terms by 37% since 2010.
In a report on the financial sustainability of local authorities, the Public Accounts Committee said that while local authorities had responded well to cuts "on the whole", there were concerns over whether some councils would continue to be financially sustainable.
"This is particularly the case for authorities responsible for adult social care and children's services," it said.
Committee chairwoman Margaret Hodge, a Labour MP, said: "These cuts have not hit all local authorities equally, with reductions ranging between 5% and 40%.
"Councils with the greatest spending needs - the most deprived authorities - have been receiving the largest reductions."
The report said the Department for Communities and Local Government - which has overall responsibility for council funding - did not fully understand the impact of funding cuts.
It said the department relied too much on spending data and had insufficient information on service levels, service quality and the financial sustainability of councils.
"Without at least an idea of the amount of funding required to maintain statutory services to a minimum standard, it is hard to see how the department could ensure that local authorities are able to fulfil their statutory duties," Mrs Hodge said.
The report also questioned whether the department was providing effective enough leadership to ensure councils could change the way they deliver their services to absorb future cuts and remain financially sustainable.
"Overall, as pressure from cuts grows, so do the risks to local authorities' finances and their provision of services.
"The depth and quality of the department's insight into these issues needs to keep pace with these changes, something it has struggled so far to achieve," the report said.
In December, ministers outlined an average funding cut of 1.8% in English councils' overall spending power, as part of the local government finance settlement for 2015-16.
Some councils will face cuts of up to 6.4% - which local authority bosses said would "push some authorities to breaking point".
The government says the funding grants settlement was "fair for all parts of the country".
Local Government Minister Kris Hopkins said at the time that the settlement still left councillors with "considerable total spending power", and that many councils were seeing growth in income from business rates.

Councils in the most deprived areas of England have been hardest hit by cuts to their funding, the Public Accounts Committee has said.

Article: The imagery, released by US geopolitical intelligence company Stratfor and taken on 31 October, shows how almost all the buildings at the airport, on the southern outskirts of Mosul, have been razed.
Runways have also been damaged, with wide trenches carved into them and rubble placed along their lengths, Stratfor's analysis says. Taxiways and aprons - where aircraft park - have also been sabotaged.
About 50,000 Iraqi security forces, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, Sunni Arab tribesmen and Shia militiamen, assisted by US-led coalition airstrikes, are currently involved in a military offensive to reclaim Mosul from IS militants.
Government forces have already retaken dozens of villages and towns surrounding the city and are currently consolidating gains made in Mosul's eastern outskirts.
The damage to the runways has rendered the airport worthless as an asset for attacking forces, says Stratfor. Airports or runways are typically a primary objective for assaults on cities, since control over them can deny or enable logistical capabilities, having a considerable impact on the outcome of battles.
However, IS militants have ensured there is little left for approaching forces to gain by taking the site, Stratfor says.
IS employed a similar tactic at Qayyarah air base, 70km (43 miles) south of Mosul. However, the trenches dug there only partially covered the main runway, Stratfor says, and it was restored to service within months of the Iraqi forces recapturing the base in July.
By comparison, Mosul airport's destruction could be much more difficult to repair.
Mirroring the demolition at Qayyarah, IS fighters have also levelled almost every structure at Mosul airport.
Stratfor says that as well as preventing Iraqi forces and their allies from using the facilities, the tactic also serves to clear the line of sight for IS defensive positions on the northern edge of the airport.
Along with restoring the runways, Iraqi forces would need to rebuild hangars, warehouses and other infrastructure in order to use it as a logistical base.
In contrast to the widespread destruction elsewhere in the area, the images show how the city's sugar factory remains relatively intact - testimony to its utility to IS.
After the jihadists captured Mosul in June 2014, they continued to operate the factory, says Stratfor, and more than a year later, executed the plant's manager when she refused to run it for them.
However, the images also show how coalition airstrikes, aimed at destroying key IS positions and assets, have caused some damage to the buildings.
Satellite imagery released last week, showed how IS had constructed multiple barricades across key routes into the northern Iraqi city.

Article: Many lizards can detach their tails when attacked, but fish-scale geckos have large scales that tear away with ease.
The new species is a master of this art, say scientists, having the largest scales of any known gecko.
The reptile, named Geckolepis megalepis, is described in PeerJ.
The skin of fish-scale geckos is specially adapted to tearing. The large scales are attached only by a relatively narrow region that tears with ease.
In addition, beneath the scales there is a pre-formed splitting zone within the skin itself.
Although several other geckos are able to lose their skin like this if they are grasped firmly, fish-scale geckos are able to do so actively - and at the slightest touch.
They can also grow them back scar-free in a matter of weeks, while other geckos might take a long time to regenerate their scales.
But Geckolepis megalepis is remarkable for the huge size of its scales. The researchers hypothesise that larger scales tear more easily than smaller ones, because of their greater surface area relative to the attachment area, and larger friction surface.
"What's really remarkable though is that these scales - which are really dense and may even be bony, and must be quite energetically costly to produce - and the skin beneath them tear away with such ease, and can be regenerated quickly and without a scar," said lead author Mark Scherz, from the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.
The new species was discovered in the Tsingy cave formations of northern Madagascar.

Article: An overrunning engineering project shut the line between Reading and London Paddington at the end of last year.
Major work, including extensive signalling improvements, is being carried out on the route from Good Friday to Easter Monday.
Network Rail said it had "hundreds of buses" ready in case it overruns.
Julian Burnell, from Network Rail, said the disruption was needed to allow for the last major stage of work on the Reading station redevelopment to be completed.
He added: "This is a very big project, dealing with one of the biggest bottlenecks anywhere in the country.
"I can't say there's absolutely no danger [of an overrun at Easter], but we have done everything in our power to get it finished in good time. There are hundreds of buses waiting if that happens."
On 27 December, King's Cross station was shut and Paddington was closed for part of the day after engineering works took longer than expected.

Article: The Ibrox club opened their Premiership account with a win at Motherwell and followed that up with a 6-0 thumping of Dunfermline in the League Cup.
"It is always important to build on winning. They are believing in themselves as a team," Caixinha said ahead of Hibs' visit on Saturday.
"I am a guy who chases perfection, but when I get it I want more."
Alfredo Morelos netted twice in the demolition of Dunfermline, with Bruno Alves and Daniel Candeias also scoring maiden Rangers goals in a one-sided contest.
"One of the major parts of football is enjoyment," added Caixinha. "I felt freedom from the team. The early second goal helped, but the players worked hard to get it.
"It's just a good start. We want more. We want to keep progressing.
"I believe you need to be focused at all times, with a strong mentality and team spirit.
"The boys are doing well but we still have a long journey in front of us."
Rangers and Hibs last met in the top flight in 2012, while the most recent contest came in the 2016 Scottish Cup final.
A stoppage-time header from David Gray gave Hibs a dramatic 3-2 win at Hampden but Caixinha insists he is not interested in using previous pain as a motivation.
"Football is a moment, there are no two games played the same way," he explained.
"The contest is different, what was to be fought for is totally different, so we just want to focus on the three points that we want to take, that's all.
"My concern is to prepare the team, recover the players and make them ready for a strong start at 3pm on Saturday."

Article: Plans were approved for Coastal Oil and Gas Limited to drill in a field at St Nicholas.
The permit does not allow the company to carry out fracking - hydraulic fracturing of the land - to extract any oil or gas.
Fracking is subject to a temporary ban in Wales until decision-making powers on the practice are devolved.
Natural Resources Wales said it had carried out a "thorough assessment" of the company's plans before approving them, with all work including reinstatement of the land to be completed within 12 months.
"It's important that any activity of this kind doesn't harm the environment, and this permit makes it clear what Coastal Oil and Gas Limited will need to do to comply with this," a spokesman said.
"Once the work begins, our officers will regulate and monitor the site to ensure it complies with the conditions of the permit, to protect people and the environment."
The permit for exploratory drilling comes despite a moratorium on fracking in Wales pending devolution of responsibility for such decisions.
In August, the UK government urged councils in England to speed up the process of approval for fracking projects.
However, Natural Resources Minister Carl Sargeant said fracking technology was "unproven", and that Welsh Labour ministers preferred to look at renewable energy.

Article: Tunisia had faced expulsion from the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations until apologising to Caf for complaints it lodged against the organisation during this year's Nations Cup.
Morocco, meanwhile, were only able to enter the 2017 Nations Cup qualifying draw after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) overturned a ban on its participation.
We are preparing for a future full of good things for both Africa and Morocco
"We are preparing for a future full of good things for both Africa and Morocco," said Moroccan FA chief Fouzi Lekjaa.
"We are back after a little break of a few months, but it has not had a big impact. The impact was minimal and we were, along with our Caf colleagues, able to make it pass."
Morocco were punished in February after being replaced as 2015 Nations Cup hosts last November, just two months before the competition began.
The North Africans refused to stage the tournament in January 2015, citing fears over importing the Ebola virus, and asked for a postponement of either six or twelve months instead.
Earlier this month, Cas overturned Caf's ruling and reduced a fine imposed on Morocco's FA from $1m (£675,000) to $50,000 (£34,000).
Equatorial Guinea stepped in to stage the 2015 finals, despite having just 64 days to prepare.
The host nation was also at the centre of the incident that led to Tunisia's row with Caf, which the local federation (FTF) says is now over.
"I am convinced that the page has been turned and that there will no longer by any problems," FTF vice-president Maher Snoussi told BBC Sport.
Seeking their first Nations Cup triumph since 2004, the Tunisians were leading 1-0 in the 90th minute of their quarter-final against the hosts when they were awarded a highly contentious penalty.
The spot-kick was converted and Equatorial Guinea went on to win 2-1 in extra-time, as the Tunisian players and bench largely lost their heads as tempers flared.
The Tunisians wrote a furious letter to Caf in response, which prompted African football's ruling body to demand an apology by 31 March 2015 or face disqualification from the next Nations Cup.
Contrary to media reports, the Tunisia Football Federation insists it never accused Caf nor Mauritian referee Rajindraparsad Seechurn of corruption.
"We never spoke of corruption because we had no evidence," said Snoussi.
"But we were strongly convinced that the referee sought out an unjustifiable penalty, and that perhaps he was influenced by the atmosphere inside the stadium."
"But we never accused either him or any Caf member of corruption. "We simply said the referee was very badly chosen and we contested that a 45-year-old, coming towards the end of his international career, should have been selected.
"In our famous letter, we said that the commission in charge of appointing referees had to assume responsibility for appointing a referee incapable of handling the match."
Tunisia's 2017 participation seemed in doubt until a meeting with Caf president Issa Hayatou and others in Senegal in mid-March led to a rapprochement.
"Luckily, with the strong pressure of Issa Hayatou, with whom I had a meeting in Dakar where we discussed our difference, we've managed to turn the page," said Snoussi.
"We are very happy to be playing the (2017) Nations Cup and I feel this difference has been now completely ironed out."
Following last week's draw in Cairo, Tunisia will face Togo, Liberia and Djibouti in Group A while Morocco will Cape Verde, Libya and Sao Tome in Group F.
Should the Tunisians reach the 2017 finals in Gabon, they will reach their thirteenth straight Nations Cup - which would be a record.

Sheffield Crown Court also heard how police lost tapes of an interview with defendant Sageer Hussain in 2003.
Eight men, including Mr Hussain, deny sexually abusing three girls between 1999 and 2003.
The mother of one of the alleged victims said in a statement: "Her character changed from a lovely girl to an animal. She became horrible."
She said at one stage she discovered a mobile phone in her daughter's bedroom and rang a number stored under the name 'Waleed'.
She said a man picked up the phone and said "I ain't done owt, I ain't touched her. It isn't me".
When she asked her daughter about the phone she said she burst into tears and said "They're raping me, they're raping me".
She told the court after her daughter went to the police in 2003 her family were repeatedly threatened.
"We were so distraught that we sold the business and the home and moved to Spain," she said.

Issues being disputed by the BMA and NHS include weekend pay.
"As a doctor, I can understand the anger and frustration felt by many junior doctors at this time," Dame Sally said.
"In part, this dispute is a symptom of frustration and low morale that has been building for decades and the strain that a career in medicine can place on your work-life balance.

Article: The victim, based in Hong Kong, paid the money into Lee's wife's bank account after Lee agreed to arrange for modifications to be made to the cue.
The money was transferred but the player, 39, continued using the cue.
Lee pleaded guilty to fraud at Swindon Magistrates' Court and was fined £110 and ordered to repay the £1,600.
'Drop the charges'
The court heard that when there was no sign of the snooker cue Marco Fai Pak Shek made a report to the police.
Prosecutor Michelle Hewitt told the court Lee had promised to send the cue along with letters of authenticity from himself and cue manufacturer John Parris but when the police carried out an investigation he was still using the cue as his own personal property.
Lee, who lives in Trowbridge, Wiltshire, was then arrested.
Ms Hewitt said Lee emailed Mr Shek saying he was going to personally deliver the cue.
The email read: "If you want the cue, you need to drop the charges and I will sign some pictures for you."
Mr Shek refused to drop the charges and the case continued.
Match-fixing
Mark Glendenning, for Lee, said his client had repeatedly apologised for failing to send the cue and had previously sold items to fans on his Facebook site without incident.
He said Lee had found himself embroiled in a number of difficulties which had taken up his time but "accepts in full he should have sent this cue".
Last month Lee's appeal against a 12-year ban for match-fixing was dismissed.
He was found guilty of seven charges in 2008 and 2009 including one concerning a World Championship match after a tribunal hearing in September last year.

The shares are equivalent to 5% of his total fortune, currently estimated to be $89.9bn.
Since 1994 Mr Gates, 61, and his wife Melinda have given away a total of $35bn in cash and stocks to a range of charitable causes.
The donation was made in June but became public on Monday following the filing of a document with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
Mr Gates' share in Microsoft is now just 1.3%. Prior to this, Mr Gates gave away $16bn in Microsoft shares in 1999 and $5.1bn in 2000.
The majority of all previous donations have been made to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which is primarily focused on reducing world poverty, combating infectious diseases and providing universal access to computers.
It is not known who the recipient of this latest donation is, however when federal documents are filed, it usually means new money is being given to a foundation, the Chronicle of Philanthropy reports.
In 2010, Mr and Mrs Gates and the well-known investor and philanthropist Warren Buffett created the Giving Pledge, and as of May 2017, 158 individuals or couples have agreed to contribute at least half of their wealth to charity.
This latest donation is the biggest charitable gift to have been made anywhere in the world so far this year.

The ex-West Bromwich Albion and England forward died in 2002.
A neurosurgeon said last month that he died from a brain condition linked to boxers rather than Alzheimer's disease as previously thought.
Dawn Astle said: "We want to stress the immediate message in dealing with head injuries and concussions, to discuss the FA's medical policies on this and work on player education.
"[The issue] has to be taken seriously because it's about lives.
"It's not like a back or knee injury, because once the brain is damaged it doesn't repair itself and Dad is proof of that."
Ms Astle said Dr Willie Stewart, who carried out a new examination of Mr Astle's brain, would also be at the meeting.
Astle's family have campaigned for the FA to carry out research into the risks of heading footballs and players suffering concussion.
The Justice for Jeff group has also held protests at West Brom games.
The FA previously apologised to the family for not keeping them informed about its work and said its rules on concussion were due to be changed ahead of the 2014/15 season.
A spokesman for the FA said Mr Dyke "had been keen to meet the Astle family for a long time" to hear their concerns.
It was initially believed Astle died from Alzheimer's disease, but the coroner at his inquest ruled his brain had been damaged by heading heavy leather balls.

Article: While $50m is the starting point for serious wealth, "in reality your spending power and investing power really gets to the next level when you get to around $100m", says Catherine Tillotson.
Ms Tillotson is joint managing partner of Scorpio Partnership, a London-based firm which advises the super-rich on how to manage their assets, and she says there is a reason for this dividing line between the wealthy elite and the rest of us.
"This is the point at which families will start to think about employing people purely to help them manage their financial affairs," she says.
There may now be more multi-millionaires and billionaires than ever before in the world, but since the 2008 global financial crisis the wealth gap between the world's top 1% and the rest of us has grown.
This increasingly stark division between haves and have-nots is leading to increasing rancour towards the very wealthy, say many social commentators.
Robert Kuhn is better placed than many to understand this hostility - a former investment banker and corporate strategist, he is himself among the world's wealthy elite.
The world is getting wealthier - we live longer, eat better, are better educated and fewer people live in extreme poverty.
But with the gap between rich and poor feeling bigger than ever, the BBC is investigating the winners and losers of this richer world in 2015.
A Richer World 2015
"I think much of it is justified," he says, perhaps surprisingly, "and I think we should describe why that's the case."
One of the main reasons for this, he says, is the web. "We have a very highly wired world with the internet, people are more aware of things - and I think that's a good thing."
Mr Kuhn is coy about his own net worth. When asked if it is "tens of millions" of dollars, he replies, "I would not like to be too specific, but I wouldn't contradict what you just said."
Trained as a neuroscientist, Mr Kuhn became an investment banker and then in the early 1990s sold his mergers and acquisitions firm "at the right time".
He says he worked hard, "but if I don't acknowledge there was a lot of luck involved I would be fooling myself".
He wants to encourage more and more people to become wealthy, but also to place limits on the amount of wealth that can be passed on to the next generation.
"That gives each generation a chance to have higher social mobility."
But given that the gap between rich and poor has reached its widest level for 30 years in most developed countries, according to says the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) group of developed nations - that social mobility is getting harder for many.
In the 1980s, the richest 10% had incomes seven times greater than the poorest 10% in the average industrialised country.
Now, in those same countries, the richest have incomes nine-and-a half times greater than the poorest, on average. The actual figures vary widely across the 34 OECD's member states.
In Denmark the top 10% earn about five times more than the bottom 10% - in Mexico they earn 30 times as much.
How much more do the top 10% earn than the bottom 10%?
Source: OECD (2011)
Other organisations, too, are highlighting this discrepancy between rich and poor. A report this month from the charity Oxfam says the world's wealthiest 1% will own more than 50% of the world's wealth by 2016.
"This is something that we should be very worried about," says Mark Pearson, the OECD's deputy director of employment, labour and social affairs.
If countries want to boost their economic growth, then they need to take steps to narrow this wealth gap, says the OECD.
This goes against the longstanding free market argument that rising wealth at the top will trickle down to everybody else.
But, the OECD research suggest that the reverse is true. "Our finding is that by reducing income inequality, you can boost economic growth," Mr Pearson told BBC World Service's Business Daily programme.
An increasing wealth gap hinders economic growth because it limits investment in a country's labour force, argues the OECD.
Poorer people cannot afford to spend as much as the rich can on their children's education.
And that lack of investment in education means a less educated and less flexible workforce in the long run, says the group in its research.
It is not just the super-rich that are doing well - those whose business is dealing with super-rich customers are profiting too.
Alex Cheatle is chief executive of Ten Group, a lifestyle concierge service that can helps its clients get that exclusive restaurant table, sell-out theatre ticket - or finds that vintage sports car in a particular colour.
Ten will even do your window-shopping for you, if you are too rich or famous to be able to do it yourself.
"Very often they will want us to take a picture of the window and get it to them, so they do their window shopping as and when they want to," says Mr Cheatle.
"There hasn't really been a crisis for many of our members. Business is booming for us, we've grown every year since 2008 - growing at an average rate of 25-30% a year."
When you consider how much the super-rich spend, that growth is perhaps not surprising.
Over the course of a year, it's reckoned the world's top 1% spend a staggering $45bn (£30bn) on travel and hospitality, $40bn (£26bn) on cars, and $25bn (£16bn) each on art, jewellery and watches.
Or course, the ultimate statement of wealth is to have your own super-yacht - complete with helicopter pad, speedboat tenders and even a submarine or two.
The world's biggest such boat is currently the Azzam, 180m (590ft) long, launched in 2013 at a reported cost of up to $600m (£400m) - and the sector has certainly weathered the global slowdown better than many others.

So with the wealth gap rising should the rich pay more tax, and if so would that help?
Robert Kuhn - now business and financial commentator - argues that countries that decide to increase taxes on the rich may not see any benefit.
He believes increasing income taxes to too high a level would "inhibit the creation of new wealth which is detrimental to society".
"I'm just worried about the behaviour and implications if you put too high a tax rate, what that will do to current generations in their energy and focus to create new wealth," says Mr Kuhn.
At Scipio Partnership, Catherine Tillotson says that focussing on tax misses out the contributions made by many rich patrons to philanthropic and charitable causes.
"The tax question is hugely complicated," she says.
"Most families that I've met will say that it is absolutely critical to them that they pay the right amount of tax according to the rules."
However, "in many ways those dollars spent on philanthropic passions may be doing more good than they would have done in the tax system", she says.
Yet ever since the financial crisis of 2008, and subsequent global economic slowdown, politicians have come under increasing pressure to increase tax contributions from the richest in their societies.
Protest movements such as Occupy Wall Street, which started in 2011 and has since spread to many other countries, have highlighted concern over social and economic inequality worldwide.
For his part, Robert Kuhn is not convinced that a widening wealth gap matters in economic terms, but "it matters in social stability for sure", he agrees.
"It matters in terms of social mobility of subsequent generations."
"To me that's the biggest problem, for any country," he says. "And many countries are facing that."

Article: Many lizards can detach their tails when attacked, but fish-scale geckos have large scales that tear away with ease.
The new species is a master of this art, say scientists, having the largest scales of any known gecko.
The reptile, named Geckolepis megalepis, is described in PeerJ.
The skin of fish-scale geckos is specially adapted to tearing. The large scales are attached only by a relatively narrow region that tears with ease.
In addition, beneath the scales there is a pre-formed splitting zone within the skin itself.
Although several other geckos are able to lose their skin like this if they are grasped firmly, fish-scale geckos are able to do so actively - and at the slightest touch.
They can also grow them back scar-free in a matter of weeks, while other geckos might take a long time to regenerate their scales.
But Geckolepis megalepis is remarkable for the huge size of its scales. The researchers hypothesise that larger scales tear more easily than smaller ones, because of their greater surface area relative to the attachment area, and larger friction surface.
"What's really remarkable though is that these scales - which are really dense and may even be bony, and must be quite energetically costly to produce - and the skin beneath them tear away with such ease, and can be regenerated quickly and without a scar," said lead author Mark Scherz, from the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.
The new species was discovered in the Tsingy cave formations of northern Madagascar.

Article: Last week, Seoul suspended its operations at Kaesong following the North's recent rocket and nuclear tests to cut off the money supply.
The North has called the shutdown "a declaration of war".
Kaesong was one of the last points of co-operation between the two Koreas.
The North reacted to the shutdown by expelling all South Koreans from the complex and freezing the assets of South Korean firms. It has also vowed to cut key communication hotlines with the South.
The privately-run manufacturing zone saw thousands of North Koreans working for South Korean businesses, making clothing, textiles, car parts and semi-conductors.
On Sunday, the South's unification ministry said in a statement the wages, in US dollars, had been paid to the government instead of directly to the workers.
"Any foreign currency earned in North Korea is transferred to the Workers' Party, where the money is used to develop nuclear weapons or missiles, or to purchase luxury goods," said Hong Yong-pyo, the unification minister, in a televised interview, referring to Pyongyang's ruling communist party.
He added that 70% of the money was kept by Pyongyang while workers were given tickets to buy food and essential items, and local currency. The government cited "multiple channels" as its sources for these claims but did not divulge how it had arrived at the percentage.
The South estimates about 616bn Korean won (Â£350m, $508m) had been paid to the North over the years.
Mr Hong was quoted by Yonhap news agency as saying that the South did not suspend operations earlier at Kaesong because "the international community recognised its significance", and it shut it down this time because "North Korea was only going to intensify its weapons development, and we needed to make a decisive move to alleviate our people's security concerns".
On 7 February, North Korea conducted a long-range rocket launch. It came after the country's fourth nuclear test in January.

Article: The Egypt-backed plan had envisaged a regional forum which analysts say might have forced Israel to reveal whether or not it has nuclear weapons.
The proposal was blocked by the US, the UK and Canada. The next review is set for  2020.
Israel neither confirms nor denies it has a stockpile of nuclear weapons.
Speaking after four weeks of negotiations, US Under-Secretary of State Rose Gottemoeller accused Egypt and other Arab countries of "not willing to let go of these unrealistic and unworkable conditions" for future talks.
She also said some participants tried to "cynically manipulate" the whole process.
But Egypt warned that the failure to reach a deal "will have consequences in front of the Arab world and public opinion", the Associated Press news agency reports.
Last month, Egypt had proposed to stage a regional conference - with or without Israel's participation and without an agreed agenda.
Some analysts suggested that this move might have forced Israel - which is not a party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) - to publicly clarify its position on nuclear weapons.
Decisions at NPT review conferences - held every five years - are made by consensus.
The failure of the current talks means the next gathering could only be held in 2020 at the earliest.

Article: His correspondents included David Lloyd George, William Gladstone, Rudyard Kipling, George Bernard Shaw and Arthur Conan Doyle.
And on his death 100 years ago, obituaries were effusive in their praise, calling him the last of the great Victorians.
You would be forgiven for the name Charles Darwin popping into your head - but you would be wrong.
The theory of evolution by natural selection was published jointly between Darwin and Monmouthshire-born Alfred Russel Wallace, whose interest in natural history developed when he moved to Neath and worked as a land surveyor with his brother.
But while today Darwin is a household name synonymous with the theory, Wallace struggles to gain anywhere near the recognition of his friend.
This is illustrated by an appeal this year to raise funds for a life-sized bronze statue to honour Wallace - it only reached half of its Â£50,000 target.
Wallace expert Dr George Beccaloni, who is a curator at the Natural History Museum where the statue would stand, said: "We have enough money to pay for a torso and arms at the moment.
"There are hundreds of Darwin statues and busts but there's not even a bust of Wallace.
"There's a side-profile roundel on the wall at Westminster Abbey - not far from Darwin's grave. There's not a lot else."
Interestingly, Wallace was not overlooked during his lifetime and was awarded the Order of Merit, the highest honour that could be given by the British monarch to a civilian.
His correspondents included some of the most significant politicians in recent British history, and celebrated authors and poets.
"He was extremely famous and possibly the most famous scientist and one of the most famous people in the world when he died (in 1913)," said Dr Beccaloni.
"There were very long, glowing obituaries in all the world's papers from Bombay to Boston saying he was the last of the great Victorians.
"One of the papers said only a great ruler would have had the sort of level of obituary recognition as Wallace."
He said Darwin was more famous but died many years before Wallace leaving Wallace to go on and become "the most famous living biologist in Britain".
So where did it go wrong for Wallace's reputation?
Prof Jim Costa, director of a biological research station in North Carolina, USA, and an expert on both men, says part of the problem appears to be that Wallace failed to promote his role in formulating the theory as effectively as Darwin.
While they had jointly published the theory of evolution by natural selection in a paper in August 1858, it was Darwin's On the Origin of Species the very next year that truly grabbed the public's imagination.
Even one of Wallace's own books appeared to pass on the credit for the discovery. It was called 'Darwinism: An Exposition of the Theory of Natural Selection with Some of Its Applications'!
Prof Costa said another factor was what became known as the "eclipse of Darwinism", when natural selection fell out of favour in the late 19th Century.
By the time it was revived in the 1930s, neither man was around and the world was a very different place.
"I think when this idea was resurrected in 1930 there was a new generation and they very much had Darwin on their minds," said Prof Costa.
"Wallace I think had a role in this - his book 'Darwinism' for example. He tended to downplay his role in public forums and that just didn't serve him well.
"When it [natural selection] was resurrected, it was always associated with Darwin."
He said when evolutionary biology really took off in the 1940s, the history of the discovery had been largely forgotten.
A Darwin "industry" developed and, said Prof Costa, it viewed Darwin as the "great visionary".
While little has changed since in terms of public acclaim, there are signs that Wallace's work is gaining more recognition in certain circles.
A series of events are being held around the world to commemorate the centenary of Wallace's death this year under the Wallace100 banner.
These include an exhibition in Swansea, a lecture in Berlin and a two-day conference in Malaysia.
Comedian Bill Bailey recently unveiled a restored portrait of Wallace at the Natural History Museum and has also filmed a two-part documentary for the BBC about Wallace.
Thousands of Wallace's letters have been put online for the first time, including correspondence with Darwin about evolution by natural selection.
There is even hope for the statue with renewed efforts being made to raise the rest of the money by August.
But gaining the same level of acclaim as Darwin is another matter.
"I think that in the popular imagination, it would be very, very difficult. It's indelibly Darwin and monkeys," said Prof Costa.
"I don't think there's much we can do about that but I do think he will emerge from relative eclipse by Darwin, certainly in the broad academic world and the world of naturalists.
"He contributed so much."

Article: The UK government has announced measures to speed up development.
Natural Resources Minister Carl Sargeant has written to councils reminding them of the temporary ban on fracking in Wales.
He said fracking technology was "unproven", saying Welsh ministers preferred to look at renewable energy.
Fracking is a process of using high pressure water to break up rocks deep underground to release gas and pipe it to the surface.
It is a major industry in the United States, but there are concerns about safety, the environment and underground water.
There have been protests against applications for test drilling for gas in both the Vale of Glamorgan and Wrexham, as well as sites in England.
Energy Secretary Amber Rudd has stressed the UK government's support for fracking, and frustration at delays in its development.
She has told councils in England to make decisions on applications within 16 weeks, to stop the process being "dragged out for months".
In his letter to Welsh councils, Mr Sargeant said the new guidance only applied to England and that the moratorium in Wales remained in place.
"The UK government's general support for oil and gas applications is contrary to the approach of the Welsh Government of promoting renewable and low carbon forms of energy through the planning system and other measures," he said.
"We still see renewable energy as a key element in ensuring that Wales achieves sustainable development for the benefit of future generations.
"Local planning authorities must ensure that planning applications for renewable energy projects are determined within statutory timescales."
Plans to devolve control over fracking were confirmed in the Queen's Speech in June following the Conservatives' general election victory.

Article: Media playback is not supported on this device
Since dethroning Wladimir Klitschko in Dusseldorf last November, the Briton has resembled a runaway lorry - smashing through road blocks and red lights, skittling well-meaning people frantically waving warning flags, and only slowing down to shout obscenities and honk his horn, the louder the better.
But that can happen when your mind is scrambled and you don't know what's what: you might be in the driver's seat but your hands aren't on the wheel, your feet are up on the dashboard and there's a brick on the accelerator pedal.
Another way of looking at it is that Fury's crash actually came on that fateful night in Germany and he has been spewing smoke ever since. The morning after the Englishman's stunning upset of Klitschko and his acquisition of the WBA, IBF and WBO belts, he admitted he might struggle to cope.
But not even those closest to him could have anticipated how true that would prove. Having beaten the various boxing authorities to the punch and relinquished the belts before being banned, stripped or both, it's anyone's guess as to when - if ever - he'll have his keys back and his engine revving again.
Fury has been speaking about his mental health struggles for years, with disarming and often alarming frankness. So his pronouncement immediately after his victory over Klitschko and the recent news that he was withdrawing from the scheduled rematch because of depression was not a shock.
When I interviewed him in 2013, he described himself as "an all-action man in anything I do. If I'm drinking, I'm drinking until I can't stand up. If I'm going out for Chinese, I'm going to an all-you-can-eat Chinese. If I'm eating cake, I'm eating the whole cake. I don't know what you'd call me. An idiot, maybe?"
Hardly surprising, then, that having fulfilled his dream of winning the world heavyweight crown, Fury would lose focus. Most people having fallen down drunk or eaten a whole cake would steer clear of booze and Battenbergs for a while. But Fury is not most people.
Fury is not the first boxer to lose motivation having reached the pinnacle of the sport, and he certainly won't be the last. Not many people climb Everest twice.
The repeated claims from Fury's camp that his victory was downplayed by the British media, and that they had an agenda against him from the outset, are delusional
After pulling off one of the greatest shocks in sporting history by beating the seemingly invincible Mike Tyson in 1990, Buster Douglas didn't train much, got fat and lost the world heavyweight crown to Evander Holyfield in his first defence. The American promptly retired, almost doubled in weight, then nearly died after falling into a diabetic coma before being struck down by depression. Same old, same old.
Jess Willard's victory over the great Jack Johnson in 1915 was almost as unbelievable as Douglas's upset of Tyson, and his reign even more shameful. Willard clearly didn't fancy fighting much, defending the world heavyweight crown once in four years before being bashed up by the great Jack Dempsey.
Sometimes depression can be triggered by a lack of motivation for the thing that defines you, sometimes that lack of motivation is triggered by depression. Either way, Fury claims he hasn't been near a gym for months and has been drinking like a fish and hoovering up cocaine instead, in a forlorn bid to mask the pain.

In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine this month, Fury accused the British media of conducting a "witch hunt" against him and the British public of racism. It is important to separate the different links in Fury's sometimes rambling trains of thought.
Before and after his victory over Klitschko, sports writers openly discussed whether Fury should be saved from himself. Different journalists operate under different editorial guidelines, but the view of most was that they had been sent to Germany to report on a fight, not Fury's controversial outbursts.
As such, the repeated claims from Fury's camp that his victory was downplayed by the British media, and that they had an agenda against him from the outset, are delusional. Almost every boxing writer proclaimed Fury's performance as one of the finest ever by a British fighter, and they were right.
But the problem with a siege mentality is that you forget what's happening beyond the castle walls, who your real friends are, and paranoia sets in.
When Fury threatened violence against a journalist and later took aim at bisexual, transsexual and Jewish people, it was internet vloggers - to whom he had granted intimate access - who provided the platform. The so-called mainstream media (newspapers and major broadcasters) had been frozen out, ironically because they had dared to report what he had told those same vloggers.
Fury's camp would do well to memorise a quote attributed to George Orwell: "Journalism is printing what someone else does not want printing. Everything else is public relations." How many times has Fury been saved by journalistic self-censorship?
In threatening that journalist, the Mail on Sunday's Oliver Holt, for reporting that he had compared homosexuality to paedophilia, Fury betrayed his sense of entitlement - not only because of his feats in the ring, but because of his religious convictions. If it's in the Bible, how dare anyone question his beliefs?
If you make questionable statements about gay people or Jews or women, the media will come down on you, whether you are a fine boxer, a deeply religious man, a nice bloke really, none of the above or all of them. Fury's Traveller heritage doesn't come into it, as least as far as most of the media is concerned.
"I know Tyson personally and he's a really nice guy," says Ricky Hatton, Fury's fellow Mancunian and another boxer who has struggled with depression. "But sometimes he puts his mouth into gear before his brain and when someone puts a camera in front of him he feels he has to say something outrageous."
Fury fans frequently claim that Anthony Joshua is given preferential treatment by the media, but this is because the IBF heavyweight champion - Fury was stripped of that belt shortly after winning it because he would not face the federation's mandatory challenger - largely conducts himself like a gentleman. As for Joshua's brushes with the law, they have been covered at length in the media and he has clearly learnt from them.
However, some of the racial abuse Fury receives on social media is despicable.
When you are called every name under the sun on a daily basis, it is likely to have an effect on your mental wellbeing. No wonder, as Fury also stated in his interview with Rolling Stone, that he feels like everyone is out to get him.
On Wednesday, the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC) met to discuss what should be done with Fury, and has suspended his licence, pending a meeting with him. It could hardly do otherwise. It did the same to Hatton in 2010, also following allegations of cocaine use, and, as the BBBofC's general secretary Robert Smith has pointed out, "cocaine is against the law of the land".
There was also Fury's alleged use of performance-enhancing drugs and a subsequent ban to consider (Fury has an appeal hearing scheduled in November), as well as the allegation that he refused to take a drugs test (a misdemeanour that can lead to a four-year ban) and the argument that a man with severe mental health issues shouldn't be anywhere near a boxing ring.
It should also be remembered that the BBBofC has already fined Fury twice for misconduct and that it has boxing's image to think about - as mad as that sounds.
Even if Fury hadn't voluntarily given up his belts, the WBA and WBO would have stripped him of them.
It might seem callous, but the sanctioning bodies are businesses, the heavyweight belts are their biggest money-spinners and it is only fair that other boxers should be allowed to fight for them. It makes no difference whether a boxer has meningitis, a broken leg or mental health issues, the sport must move on. As WBO chief Jose Izquierdo put it: "We can't have a belt held hostage."
One can only hope that, during his absence from the ring, Fury gets the help he so desperately needs and returns fitter and more focused.
"Being someone who lives by the seat of his pants and for the moment, this could be the end of him," was Hatton's grim assessment. "He doesn't like boxing and finds the training hard. It's not looking good.
"But I was in a dark place, didn't care if I lived or died. I did very well in boxing but near enough everything wrong in life. The only way I got out of it was by asking for help. I fought through it and I hope Tyson can do the same."
Fingers crossed that Fury will be remembered for that fine performance against Klitschko in Dusseldorf - and for many fine performances in the future - rather than as a wreck, spewing smoke on the side of the road as bright lights flash by.

Tyson Fury's recent withdrawal from his rematch with Wladimir Klitschko due to depression has raised concerns about his mental health and future in boxing, with some critics suggesting that his controversial statements and behavior may be a sign of a deeper

Article: The lowest is Knowsley which could fall to zero as the last school teaching A-levels is closing its sixth form.
In a further seven authorities there are less than 20% of students taking A-levels in schools in their boroughs.
Nick Timothy of New Schools Network, which carried out the research, said it was a "glass ceiling" on ambition.
But a Department for Education spokeswoman said the figures were "misleading", because pupils could be studying A-levels in schools in other local authorities.
The analysis shows the wide differences in the numbers of young people taking A-levels in state schools and colleges in their council areas and getting qualifications that would help them apply for university places.
Source: New Schools Network
In 27 authorities, fewer than a quarter of pupils in this age group are taking A-levels in their council area.
In contrast, Harrow has 74% of pupils studying for A-levels in schools in the borough, and it's 71% in Darlington.
Teenagers might be travelling to take A-levels in schools and colleges in neighbouring local authorities.
But the study found that the authorities neighbouring these areas of low A-level take up were themselves likely to have below-average provision, so that students would have to compete for limited numbers of places.
The study warns of a "deep-seated problem" in ensuring that young people in poorer areas are able to take A-levels, saying that "access to A-levels is closely linked to deprivation" - with consequences for higher education and jobs.
But it shows that there is nothing inevitable about poorer areas being linked to low A-level take up and lower levels of university entry.
It highlights St Helens and the London boroughs of Lewisham and Islington as examples of authorities with both higher levels of deprivation and higher levels of young people taking A-levels.
Highest proportion of students taking A-levels
Source: New Schools Network
The analysis has been produced by the New Schools Network, which supports the opening of free schools, and it argues that these cold spots in A-level provision show the need for more schools serving this age group.
"Gaps in A-level provision are creating a glass ceiling for the poorest pupils by limiting access to A-Levels - which still offer the best chance of access to higher education and good employment prospects," said the organisation's director, Nick Timothy.
Leon Riley, who will become head of New College Doncaster, says that it will support students who at present have to go elsewhere.
"Currently 1,200 students travel outside Doncaster to access post-16 education. This cannot be right: we want to make a difference by providing local young people with access to top quality post-16 education," he said.
The analysis by New Schools Network follows the decision by the last school in Knowsley to offer A-levels, Halewood Academy, to close its sixth form.
The authority, which already has the lowest rate of A-level students and one of the lowest university entry rates in the country, will have no one taking A-levels in schools in the borough from next year.
As an academy, Halewood can decide to stop teaching A-levels without the local authority having any powers of intervention.
Parents at the school had campaigned to keep the sixth form, but the academy said that it was not financially viable.
"This is letting down the children of this community. There are people who want to go to university, lots of kids who want to do well," parent Vanessa Pointon said about the closure plans.
Knowsley council says the loss of A-levels in the borough is "not a council decision".
The regional schools commissioner, appointed to oversee academies by the Department for Education, has so far not set out any response to the withdrawal of A-level provision in Knowsley.
The Department for Education has not commented on plans for A-levels in Knowsley, but a spokeswoman rejected the analysis by the New Schools Network.
"These figures are completely misleading - they do not reflect those young people who study A-levels in a neighbouring borough, the actual levels of participation are far higher because many will choose to study in other areas.
"The primary reason the uptake of A-levels differs from area to area is because demand varies across the country. Where there is demand, provision is always available."

The stark regional differences in the proportion of pupils studying A-levels in local state schools in England has been revealed - ranging from 2% to 74%.

Article: Dai Young, boss of Premiership leaders Wasps, expects a number of his in-form players to make the cut.
"I'd like to think, the way we've played, we'll have a few in there," Young told BBC Sport.
"I know [Jones has] had contact with some of the players on a regular basis - we have got a number in the mix."
Jones will also name a trimmed down party of approximately 35 for a training camp in Brighton next week.
The final squad before the autumn Tests will be named on 26 October, and with injuries to Wasps' James Haskell and Harlequins' Jack Clifford, England currently have a void at open-side flanker.
Northampton's Teimana Harrison started there in England's last match - against Australia in Sydney as Jones' men wrapped up a series whitewash - and is set to be named in Friday's squad.
But the Wasps' pair of Guy Thompson and Sam Jones have impressed so far this campaign.
"There has been a lot of talk about Guy with his form at the start of the season," added Young.
"And everyone knows what a big fan I am of Sam Jones - his work-rate is phenomenal."
Hooker Tommy Taylor has been "excellent" according to Young, while Wasps number eight Nathan Hughes is likely to be involved having qualified on residency in the summer.
Scrum-halves Joe Simpson and Dan Robson have also both stood out in partnership with fly-half Danny Cipriani.
Meanwhile, Leicester flanker Will Evans has been touted as a possible solution to England's number seven conundrum.
Evans starred for the Junior World Championship-winning Under-20s in the summer, and followed that by being named in an England training squad in August.
It is understood Evans is set be named in the EPS on Friday, but his director of rugby at the Tigers, Richard Cockerill, says the 19-year-old should not yet be thrust into the international arena.
"Will is not ready to play international rugby," Cockerill told BBC Sport.
"The reality is he has started one game for Leicester, and before that he was playing for Ampthill in National One.
"Eddie sees him as a project player and is keen to get the transfer from 20s to the senior group - and his potential is huge.
"He is a great young player, who is going to be very, very good. But at the moment but he is not ready yet [for Test rugby]."
However, Cockerill feels differently about Mike Williams, the Zimbabwe-born Tigers forward, who is a firm part of Jones' plans, and could even make his England debut come November.
"Mike Williams has a little bit more experience," Cockerill said of the 24-year-old.
"Given the opportunity he is ready to step up to Test match level today."

Prime Minister David Cameron previously said the plan was a "very good idea".
Royal Mail spokesman Simon Fellman said: "We're delighted to do it and we're pleased so many people are delighted about it."
The Royal Mail has painted more than 50 postboxes gold following Team GB's gold medal haul at London 2012.
Originally it said it was only painting them in "winners' home towns, or towns with which they are closely associated".
Town mayor Elizabeth Hodgkin said: "We are the home of rowing... I feel very excited about it.
"I think it's wonderful news, it's a great thing for the town."
Mr Fellman said: "It's almost like the torch has come again. It's a piece of the Olympics coming back to people's doorsteps.
"The support for the boxes, it's kind of like the new tourist attraction. It's fantastic and I think people have really taken it to their hearts."

Article: The exhibition, From Dark to Light, explores the work of artist Victor Noble Rainbird, who was born in North Shields in 1887.
The largest collection to have been staged since the 1930s, his favourite subjects were the North Sea and the streets and people of his hometown.
Curator Dave Young said there was a lot of affection for him in the town.
Many of the pieces on display at The Old Low Light Heritage Centre in North Shields have never been seen in public before.
Mr Young, said: "We hope that this exhibition will shed new light on the life and work of a remarkable man and also a much misunderstood artist.
"This is the first major exhibition of his paintings to be held in his hometown of North Shields since the artist's lifetime and it is being held in a building that he would have known well and often painted.
"Victor Noble Rainbird's paintings are a fascinating legacy of life in the North East before and after the Great War, while his own remarkable war record is only now being unravelled."
Mr Rainbird joined the Northumberland Fusiliers in 1914 when he was 26-years-old and served on the Western Front at Ypres, Passchendaele, Vimy Ridge and Armentieres.
Some of the drawings he produced while on active service have survived and are included in the exhibition.
Mr Young said they were a "poignant, important and sombre record of the horrors of war".
After the war, Rainbird made several return trips to France, Belgium and the Netherlands, producing some of his most impressive works.
He died aged 47 in 1936.
From Dark to Light: exploring the life and art of Victor Noble Rainbird is on display at The Old Low Light Heritage Centre from 10 July to 6 September.

Article: Beji Caid Essebsi, who won the first round with 39% of the vote, is challenging interim leader Moncef Marzouki.
Mr Essebsi represents the secular-leaning Nidaa Tounes party.
Tunisia was the first country to depose its leader in the Arab Spring and inspired other uprisings in the region.
Polls closed at 18:00 local time (17:00 GMT). Voter turnout had reached 36.8% after four and a half hours of voting, Tunisia's election authority said.
Shortly after polls closed, Mr Essebsi's office said that there were "indications" that he had won.
However, a spokesman for Mr Marzouki said the claims were "without foundation".
Mr Essebsi, who turned 88 this week, held office under both deposed President  Zine el-Abedine Ben Ali and Tunisia's first post-independence leader, Habib Bourguiba.
He is popular in the wealthy, coastal regions, and based his appeal to voters on stability and experience.
His opponent, Moncef Marzouki, is a 67-year-old human rights activists forced into exile by the Ben Ali government.
He has been interim president since 2011 and is more popular in the conservative, poorer south.
After casting his ballot, Mr Marzouki said Tusinians "should be proud" of themselves "because the interim period has come to a peaceful end".
Mr Marzouki was thought likely to attract support from the moderate Islamist Ennahda party, which has played a key role in Tunisian politics since the Arab Spring but did not field a candidate.
Whoever wins faces restricted powers under a constitution passed earlier this year.
The president will be commander-in-chief of the armed forces but can appoint or sack senior officers only in consultation with the prime minister.
The president will also set foreign policy in consultation with the prime minister, represent the state and ratify treaties.
Tunisia boosted security for the elections and closed border posts with Libya, which has been plagued by unrest.
A group of at least three attackers targeted a polling station near the city of Kairouan on Sunday morning. Security forces say they killed one attacker and arrested three.
In the build-up to the vote, a video emerged of Islamic State militants claiming responsibility for the 2013 killings of two Tunisian politicians.
The men in the video also condemned the election and threatened more killings.
An interior ministry spokesman dismissed the video, saying the group "mean nothing to us".
About 5.2 million Tunisians were eligible to vote in the run-off poll. At least 88,000 observers oversaw the election, according to Tunisian state media.

Voters in Tunisia have been choosing their first freely elected president in a run-off election seen as a landmark in the country's move to democracy.

Article: Lennon, who managed Brown, now 31, in his four years as Celtic boss, says the midfielder's decision would boost Gordon Strachan's Scotland squad.
"It is not a surprise because I thought he retired too early," said Lennon.
"Sometimes you can make these decisions and then think you have still got plenty to offer."
Brown's return to the fold means that on Wednesday he is almost certain to be included in Strachan's squad for the World Cup qualifier against England at Wembley on 11 November.
Lennon told BBC Scotland: "I think last season his injuries took a toll on him and we didn't see the best of him but certainly this season he is looking far more like himself again and playing very well, which will be an asset to Scotland.
"I think his presence around the dressing room and training ground and certainly on the pitch will be felt if he is not there.
"He is only 31 and there is plenty more to come from him. I thought his decision was premature anyway."
Lennon does not envisage any issues with Brown returning to the squad for a game he believes Scotland can win.
"I don't know how it would affect the dynamic of the group but certainly I think it would pep it up," he added.
"It was a poor performance and result in Slovakia and it might just give them the wee jag they need, having a player of that quality back.
"The England game is one I think they can win. It will be a British style of game and there won't be anything the Scottish players will be surprised about."
Scotland assistant manager Mark McGhee, meanwhile, looked forward to the team benefiting from Brown's leadership, saying "by example and his voice and influence, (he) makes other people better".
McGhee added: "Scott Brown is someone who I would imagine, when England are looking at our squad and our team, would prefer him not to be playing.
"He looks as if he has coped better with combining the European and league campaigns. He feels good about himself and he can do both at this stage.
"I would imagine he has been revitalised by Brendan (Rodgers, the Celtic manager). I think the manager has given him a new lease of life.
"He would have made his [original] decision in an honest way. But now he has looked at it and decided it was clearly the wrong decision.
"If the other players feel that Scott Brown gives us a better chance of winning the game, they will be delighted to have him back."

Peaty, 22, who also retained his 100m title on Monday, finished in 25.99 seconds - just short of the world record 25.95 he set in the semi-final.
Brazil's Joao Gomes Junior took silver and South African Cameron van der Burgh was third.
"I'm feeling very good. I'm so, so happy with my displays," Peaty said.
He was speaking to the BBC after taking part in the 4x100m mixed medley relay final, in which defending champions Britain finished fifth. USA won in a world record time of three minutes 38.56 seconds. Australia took silver, with China and Canada in joint third.
It was a different story in his individual race, earlier. Peaty was level with his rivals in the first few strokes before he pulled away after 30 metres. The City of Derby swimmer appeared set to break the world record for a third time in two days, but narrowly fell short.
The Briton suggested "equilibrium" was key to his successes.
"I'm a massive believer that all areas of your life need to be equal for you to perform at your best," he added. "Lifestyle, family and friendships. If one is out then you are not going to be at that level."

Van der Burgh, the 2009 and 2013 world champion in the 50m breaststroke, paid tribute to Peaty's powerful performances.
"I think I have to retire and give it a few years and come back when he's older," joked the 29-year-old.
"It's really impressive. It's not even breaststroke anymore, he's swimming like a new kind of stroke, like a metamorphosis between [butter]fly and breast.
Former British swimmer Mark Foster told BBC Sport that Peaty's display was "immense".
"There not enough words to describe how good he is," he said.
"Under 26 seconds for the second time - only four hundredths of a second off his best time. It was, again, an immense swim."
Karen Pickering, British 2001 world 4x200m freestyle gold medallist
We all know how strong Peaty is.
In his semi-final he was a little bit lower in the water as he set his world record. Because he's not quite as high as he is in the 100m, he has a quicker turnover. He can keep that up for 50m, but not for a 100m - that's why he went to 25.95 seconds.
You couldn't do that in the 100m because of the build-up of lactic acid. But because it's Adam Peaty, he might be able to manage that in a year.

"We're always in the mix - it'll be a tough race," Litchfield told BBC Sport. "It'll be nice to get a little bit of revenge after finishing fourth in the 400m IM at Rio 2016."
South Africa's Chad le Clos stormed to victory in the 200m butterfly final in one minute 53.33 seconds. Home favourite Laszlo Cseh closed the gap to the London 2012 champion in the final few metres, but had to settle for silver.
Le Clos was in tears during the medal ceremony. His father Bert, who became a celebrity because of his interviews during London 2012, and mother Geraldine were present in the Budapest arena. The pair had been receiving treatment for cancer.
"Last year, my family's health is more important than gold medals," said the 25-year-old swimmer, who finished fourth in the event at Rio 2016.

Article: No pope had resigned for 600 years.
A second surprise was that after spending a short period of rest at the papal summer villa at Castelgandolfo, near Rome, he decided to take up residence again inside the walls of Vatican City where a former convent had been converted for his personal use.
How would the ex-pontiff and the new reigning Pope manage to co-habit?
When rival popes were elected for political reasons in different parts of Europe during the late Middle Ages, it caused confusion and conflict within the church.
But in this case there has been an exceptionally smooth transition from one papacy to the next.
Pope Benedict, or rather Emeritus Pope Benedict to give him his new official title, lives only a few hundred metres away from his successor Pope Francis.
The two popes visit each other occasionally and communicate fairly frequently by telephone and letter.
Pope Benedict, who for the previous eight years was one of the world's highest profile public figures, now keeps deliberately out of the limelight.
"He lives discreetly without a public life, but that doesn't mean he is isolated," says Father Federico Lombardi, the Vatican's official spokesman.
The 86-year-old former pope spends his time very quietly: reading, praying, studying, handling correspondence, receiving occasional visitors.
He also plays Mozart and Beethoven on the baby grand piano that he brought with him when he left the spacious papal apartments in the Apostolic Palace.
The same four consecrated laywomen - who kept house for him when he was pope - continue to run his more modest new household.
They have been photographed with him, taking his daily walk with the aid of a black cane in the well manicured Vatican gardens behind St Peter's Basilica, an oasis of tranquillity., situated in the heart of Rome, yet sheltered from the din and traffic chaos of the Italian capital.
Benedict was guest of honour at a luncheon party given by Pope Francis at the Casa Santa Marta - the Vatican guest house where he has chosen to live - to celebrate his own 77th birthday just before Christmas.
Writing a few days later to the dissident Swiss theologian Hans Kueng - with whom he had had a serious falling out years ago, banning him from teaching at a Catholic university - the former Cardinal Ratzinger showed a much more conciliatory attitude than he had shown during his years in positions of power inside the Vatican.
"I am grateful  to be bound by a great identity of views and by a deep friendship with Pope Francis," he wrote to Prof Kueng. "My only final task is to support his papacy in my prayers."
Superficially, nothing much has changed inside the Vatican during the year of two popes.
Some key new appointments - such as that of the pope's deputy, or secretary of state, have been made by Pope Francis - but the weekly rhythm of business inside the world's smallest sovereign state continues as before.
Bishops from around the world are beginning to arrive again in national groups to make their annual five-yearly report to Rome on what is going on in their dioceses.
Heads of state and government are received in private audience by Pope Francis.
Attendance at the Pope's Wednesday General Audience and his regular Sunday blessing of the faithful in St Peter's Square has more than doubled since Pope Benedict's resignation.
This reflects the growing international popularity of his successor, the first Pope from the Americas, who has not surprisingly been declared person of the year by Time Magazine and been celebrated by cover stories in the New Yorker and even the pop music magazine Rolling Stone.
Archbishop Georg Gaenswein has been Pope Benedict's private secretary for nearly a decade and continues to live in the convent with the former pontiff.
He is one of the few people who see both popes on a daily basis, as he is also responsible for arranging the diary and engagements of Pope Francis as Head of the Papal Household.
"I try to be a bridge between both popes, and so far it has worked very well. I hope the two bosses are happy," the archbishop told Reuters news agency.

When Pope Benedict XVI suddenly announced exactly one year ago that he was resigning for health reasons, he sent shock waves around the world.

Article: The Communication Workers Union said the walkout would start on Monday 19 December and include Christmas Eve.
It will involve thousands of workers from the Crown Post Offices.
The Post Office said despite the walkout it would be "business as usual" with "at least" 97% of its 11,600 branches not involved.
Crown Post Offices are the larger branches that are usually located in High Streets.
In April 2016, the Post Office announced plans to transfer up to 61 branches into WH Smith stores over the following year.
It said the move was part of a 10-year plan to cut costs and save cash, and would act as a way of "safeguarding the future of the network."
"Our members want the Post Office management to pause its closure and privatisation programme, hold off on its planned pensions changes, and commit to sitting down with us and with the other key stakeholders of this Great British institution and, together, construct a lasting vision," said CWU assistant secretary Andy Furey.
The Post Office said it was "extremely disappointed" by the CWU's action.
"Just today, we agreed with the CWU that we would resume talks, which have been ongoing throughout the summer, on Wednesday," added Kevin Gilliland, the Post Office's network and sales director.

Article: At the end of his speech launching the party's manifesto, Mike Nesbitt said: "Domination doesn't work, partnership does."
Ulster Unionists want the election to be a referendum on how the Renewable Heat Incentive debacle was handled.
But the focus has now turned on them following Mr Nesbitt's comments.
Mr Nesbitt was asked about the decision of his senior party colleague Danny Kennedy to publicly distance himself from the remarks.
He turned to Mr Kennedy, who was sitting behind him on the platform, and said: "It wasn't disappointing, it was actually quite reaffirming to know Danny was listening."
The line brought laughter from other candidates and party members.
Under questioning from journalists, Mr Nesbitt denied that he had any regrets or that he had made a mistake.
"What I have said consistently is vote Ulster Unionists and then for any candidate that you believe will do the right thing within your community, within your constituency and within the country," he said.
He added that he "wouldn't withdraw a word" of what he had said and was thinking only of what what would happen after the election.
"The fact is, if we are going into [Stormont] Castle, it will be with a nationalist party," he said.
"Now, would I rather go in with Sinn FÃ©in or the SDLP? I would rather go in with the SDLP."
Mr Nesbitt went on to say that, on Monday, he spent a lot of time time knocking doors in heavily unionist areas with "very little criticism and a lot of support for what I was talking about".
"I am confident in my position and I'm very confident and relaxed that [candidates] behind me are taking different positions in terms of vote transfer," he said.
"But people will come back on 2 March to thinking about the Â£85,000 a day that is going up in smoke, the 10 years of the DUP and Sin FÃ©in in that castle and the impossibility, no matter what anybody writes in a platform piece for the newspaper, of leopards changing their spots."
The manifesto, entitled 'Real Partnership', includes calls for action in tackling waiting lists, increasing PSNI numbers to 7,500, prioritising the York Street interchange, standing up for the LGBT community and "guaranteeing" that no group is worse off because of Brexit.

Article: For Volkswagen, the reaction to the revelations that it deliberately tried to game tests supposed to reduce pollution will be as vital in determining the long term damage to the company as the fact of the original offence.
Today's review of how Thomas Cook dealt with the deaths of Bobbi and Christi Shepherd in 2006 shows how the tragedy was then compounded by the company's reaction - a company, it should be noted, which says it tries to "consistently meet and exceed the expectations of its customers".
Take one small example - Thomas Cook's response to a request from the family for legal support during the inquest.
In 2014, the company turned down the request, only reversing their position after Peter Fankhauser, Thomas Cook's chief executive, met Sharon Wood and Neil Shepherd, Bobbi and Christi's parents, this year.
"The fact that this tragic situation spanned almost 9 years is testimony to how much the legal rather than human considerations dominated the landscape," Justin King writes in his report.
Earlier attempts by the family to meet previous chief executives were rebuffed or ignored, Mr King reveals.
He makes it clear that at the time of the tragedy the company was focused on "financial, contracting, the airlines and destination" and has only recently been "moving to create a real customer focus".
The report says that the "destination management" process - which encompasses the famous "holiday rep" that is often the first point of call for holidaymakers - saw its role as the "maximisation of revenue for the minimum of cost".
That can lead to tensions and a "misalignment of goals", with cost cutting leading to less time spent with holidaymakers and failing online systems.
In one instance, Mr King reveals, IT systems are so poor, staff in holiday destinations cannot access the Thomas Cook website.
In such an environment health and safety - often the general butt of jokes about officialdom gone mad - can appear a Cinderella service, under-resourced and under-powered.
Indeed Mr King says that Thomas Cook's Health and Safety Management System, despite being an "excellent framework", suffered from "a number of significant shortcomings in [its] implementation and operation".
How many businesses could confidently say that was not the same in their company?
Even now, Mr King believes that, the new contract Thomas Cook has signed for the provision of health and safety auditing within the company is "at the lower end of the scale, reflecting budgetary constraints".
"Adequate" is the best Mr King can say of the present approach, and information on customer complaints - often an early warning of problems - is "not collected with sufficient robustness", he says.
Different parts of the business operate in silos, and the sharing of information is not what it should be.
Every company chief executive should read Mr King's report. And reflect on now many of the problems he has identified are also true of the businesses they run.

In an era when there is considerable suspicion about the motivation of businesses, the ability of a company to react to a crisis in a way that reveals it to be run by human beings rather than faceless chief executives is of paramount importance.

Article: He welcomed Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Enda Kenny's comments on a possible referendum on Irish unity.
DUP MP Ian Paisley said Mr Kenny was "being mischievous".
The taoiseach said Brexit talks should consider that a clause in the Good Friday Agreement could result in the calling of a referendum.
In his remarks to reporters on Monday at the annual MacGill Summer School in Glenties, County Donegal, Mr Kenny said the triggering of a border poll required "clear evidence of a majority of people wishing to leave the UK and join the Republic".
He added: "It may be, in the eyes of some, a fanciful theory but who knows what happens in 10, 20 years time?"
Adams responded by calling for all parties supporting a united Ireland "to discuss how best this can be achieved."
"In the context of the north being dragged out of the EU by England, there is now a greater opportunity to achieve this," he said.
North Antrim MP Mr Paisley said Secretary of State James Brokenshire and his predecessor, Theresa Villiers, had both ruled out holding a referendum.
"It's not going to happen," he said.
"We all know in the next nine months Enda Kenny is not going to be taoiseach. So, he's really just being mischievous.," Mr Paisley added.
Ulster Unionist MLA Jenny Palmer described Mr Kenny's comments as "much ado about nothing".
She said that, in the wake of the EU referendum, the Stormont executive's priority should be "to convince the people of Northern Ireland that they have a plan for the way forward for our economy, our farmers, our voluntary and community groups, our universities and everyone else who depends heavily on EU funding and support."

Article: Thermal cameras detected higher temperatures in three adjacent stones at the bottom of the Great Pyramid.
Officials said possible causes included the existence of empty areas inside the pyramid, internal air currents, or the use of different building materials.
It comes as experts search for hidden chambers within the pyramids.
The tombs of the pharaohs Khufu (Kheops), Khafre (Khephren) and Menkaure (Mycerinus) were built in the Fourth Dynasty, about 2613-2494BC.
A team of architects and scientists from Egypt, France, Canada and Japan used infrared thermography to survey the pyramids during sunrise, as the sun heats the limestone structures from the outside, as well as at sunset when they cool down.
In a statement, the Egyptian antiquities ministry said the experts had "concluded the existence of several thermal anomalies that were observed on all monuments during the heating-up or the cooling-down phases".
"To explain such anomalies, a lot of hypotheses and possibilities could be drawn up: presence of voids behind the surface, internal air currents," it added.
An "particularly impressive" anomaly was found at ground level on the eastern side of the Great Pyramid, also known as the Pyramid of Khufu, the statement said.
"The first row of the pyramid's stones are all uniform, then we come here and find that there's a difference in the formation," Antiquities Minister Mamdouh al-Damati said as he showed reporters the three stones showing higher temperatures.
Other thermal anomalies were detected in the upper half of the Great Pyramid.
The structure will be the subject of further investigation during the Operation Scan Pyramids project, which began on 25 October and is expected to last until the end of 2016.

Article: However, Mr Tillerson said the proposals provided a basis for dialogue leading to a solution of the crisis.
On Saturday, Qatar's foreign minister rejected the list of 13 conditions imposed by Saudi Arabia and its allies, Egypt, the UAE and Bahrain.
They accuse Qatar of backing terrorism - a charge it denies.
Qatar has been under unprecedented diplomatic and economic sanctions for more than two weeks, with Iran and Turkey increasingly supplying it with food and other goods.
The four countries also want Qatar to reduce its ties with Iran and close a Turkish military base, setting a deadline on Friday of 10 days.
Among other things, the fellow Gulf states have demanded the closure of Al Jazeera TV, which is funded by the Qatari government.
Mr Tillerson said Qatar was assessing the demands and stressed there were "significant areas which provide a basis for ongoing dialogue leading to resolution".
He urged the countries to sit together to stop terrorism and counter extremism.
"A lowering of rhetoric would also help ease the tension," Mr Tillerson said.
After the demands were made on Friday, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the dispute was "a family issue" that the countries should work out together.
On Saturday, Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, quoted by Al Jazeera, said: "The US secretary of state recently called upon the blockading nations to produce a list of grievances that was'reasonable and actionable'.
"The British foreign secretary asked that the demands be'measured and realistic.' This list does not satisfy that [sic] criteria."
He said the demands were proof that the sanctions had "nothing to do with combating terrorism... [but] limiting Qatar's sovereignty, and outsourcing our foreign policy".
Al Jazeera accused them of trying to silence freedom of expression, adding: "We assert our right to practise our journalism professionally without bowing to pressure from any government or authority."
Qatar's main import routes - by land from Saudi Arabia and by sea from container ships docked in the UAE - have been disrupted, and much of the surrounding airspace has been closed to its air traffic.
However, the small but wealthy country has so far avoided economic collapse by finding alternative routes.
Qatari citizens living in neighbouring countries or with family living there have been hit harder, Reuters news agency notes, because of ultimatums issued for them to leave.
The United Arab Emirates has been trying to mediate in the crisis.
UAE's foreign minister said on Saturday there would be a "parting of ways" with Qatar if it failed to meet the demands.
"The alternative is not escalation," he said. "The alternative is parting of ways. It's very difficult for us to maintain a collective grouping with one of the partners... actively promoting what is an extremist and terrorist agenda."
US President Donald Trump has taken a hard line towards Qatar, accusing it of being a "high-level" sponsor of terrorism.

Article: An "environmentally friendly" building with a cafe, gallery and shop is planned for the park near Wakefield.
Peter Murray, executive of the YSP, said it would provide an "important new element" of the park's infrastructure and increase its income.
Arts Council England has given £1.7m to the park and the remainder is to come from fundraising.
A planning application for a second visitor centre has been submitted to Wakefield Council and it is due for completion in late 2017.
The new building has been designed to make the minimum impact on the site, YSP said.
The latest project on the 500-acre estate follows the development of the main visitor centre in 2002, the underground gallery in 2006 and refurbishment of the estate chapel in 2011.
The park attracted more than 400,000 visitors in 2014 the highest number since it opened in 1977, it said.
The development plans were revealed as the park's latest sculpture Wave is being installed.
It is part of the installation Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red that was seen at the Tower of London in 2014 where 888,246 poppies honoured every death in the British and Colonial forces of World War One.

Article: Ms Evans, who is currently suspended from UKIP, said she would "very much like" to run but a "handful of people at the top" had ensured she could not.
Ms Evans' six-month ban for bringing the party into disrepute - claims she has dismissed - means she cannot stand.
She said she would back councillor Lisa Duffy to succeed Nigel Farage.
Ms Evans said UKIP needed to "break free of its hard-right image and set itself firmly in the common sense centre-ground" and also conduct some "internal reform".
The leadership contest has been prompted by Mr Farage's decision to stand down following the UK's vote to leave the European Union, saying his "political ambition has been achieved".
In a statement in Westminster, Ms Evans, who had been touted as a possible successor, said: "I'd very much like to run in that election.
"Unfortunately there are a handful of people at the top of UKIP who, for whatever personal reasons of their own, have made quite sure I can't."
She claimed the party rulebook had been "abused" to suspend her to prevent her from representing the party in May's London Assembly elections and the upcoming leadership contest.
Her six-month suspension handed down in March came after an internal disciplinary meeting found she had publicly criticised a fellow candidate and held herself out as a party spokeswoman without authority.
Ms Evans - who has always rejected the claims against her - lost a High Court bid to overturn the decision.
In the statement, she said: "I have to face up to reality, there's no way they're going to allow me to put my name on the ballot paper... I've now given up hope of becoming the next leader of UKIP."
Ms Evans said she had questioned whether to stay on in a party that "allows, and arguably encourages senior figures to behave like this", but she said the support from members had made her "more determined ever not to give up on UKIP".
She also said that with the right leader, the "sky was the limit for the party".
Endorsing Lisa Duffy, a district councillor for Ramsey in Cambridgeshire, Ms Evans said she was "the best chance" UKIP had to "change, to grow and to thrive".
She said UKIP needed "a clean break from the past" to become more like a political party than "just a rugby club on tour".
Under Ms Duffy's leadership, she argued, the party would be "more united and consensual".
Prior to her suspension Ms Evans wrote UKIP's 2015 general election manifesto. She was axed from her policy role in the party in-fighting which followed Mr Farage's "unresignation" after the general election.
Mr Farage has denied her ban was due to criticism of him.

Article: This was the end of the road for Wales in France but the 'Red Wall' - as Wales' players have dubbed their supporters - was still roaring its encouragement at full volume.
Wales' momentous campaign was halted by a clinical Portugal side but, watching their team play their first semi-final at a major tournament, this was no occasion for fans to feel deflated.
This was a moment of mutual adoration between a team who have established themselves as Wales' greatest, and their unwavering supporters.
The bond between Wales' players and fans has been one of the defining features of Euro 2016, a symbiotic relationship that has propelled the country's football to new heights.
As well as the anthem, 'Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau', and a repertoire of hymns, the Welsh chant of choice during this tournament has been 'Don't Take Me Home'.
There was a poignancy to its airing in Lyon, for it has been a dreamlike existence for Wales fans in France. With their team absent from major tournaments for 58 years, generations in Wales have grown up to expect failure and look on longingly as others contest World Cups and European Championships.
But Chris Coleman's men have changed that. The beaming smiles on Welsh fans' faces before their opening match in Bordeaux spoke of a disbelief at seeing their team finally claiming their place among international football's elite.
"There was a psychological barrier we needed to go through for the first one, given it had been so long," said Coleman.
"We've now sampled tournament football - such an experience, such a healthy vibe from people of all nations. We want some more of that. We need some more of that."
Wales' players would have been forgiven for feeling as if they were living in a bubble at their training base in the idyllic Brittany coastal town of Dinard, where a small population and a gentle pace of life meant they could take a stroll on the beach and go unnoticed.
It is a far cry from the frenzy their success has caused back home.
With every victory in France, a new fan zone seemed to spring up in Wales, from Rhyl to Aberystwyth, from Swansea to Cardiff's Principality Stadium.
He saw us grow up. He's always in the back of our minds. When we achieve something, we think about him
The messages of support were many and varied, from David Hasselhoff to the Prince of Wales, while songs by Welsh bands the Manic Street Preachers and the Super Furry Animals gave the campaign a unique soundtrack.
Despite their serene and remote surroundings, however, the players were aware of the impression they were making.
In the age of social media, athletes and their followers are closer than ever, and Wales' squad members have relished that connection.
Hal Robson-Kanu's spectacular goal against Belgium made the unattached forward one of the unlikeliest stars of Euro 2016 and, speaking a couple of days later, he laughed when told about the global reaction to his goal - including a tweet from the former Nigeria and Arsenal striker Kanu.
There was a similar response from Joe Allen, who laughed when this reporter informed him of a fans' banner that read: "When God made Joe Allen, he was showing off."
From a journalist's perspective, covering this Wales side has been a privilege, given regular and revealing access to the coaches and players.
Gareth Bale, the world's most expensive footballer, was a picture of charm and affability as he conducted his media conferences and subsequent interviews before every match. The Real Madrid forward was as comfortable talking about the Wales squad's quiz nights and their occasional treats of burgers and chips as he was about the actual football.
For all the lustre the likes of Bale and Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey add to this Wales side, it is the unbreakable team spirit that has been the foundation of their success.
The vast majority of the squad have played youth football together, grown up together and become close friends.
Even when Bale is injured, he will join up with the squad in order to see those he misses while on club duty in Spain - Joe Ledley and Wayne Hennessey are among those he gets on with best.
These genuine friendships have bound the team together, as has a tragedy that cast a shadow over football.
The death of Coleman's predecessor Gary Speed in 2011 shocked the entire sport, with the grief particularly profound for his young Wales players, many of whom are in the current side.
Captain Ashley Williams was clearly moved as he spoke about Speed on the eve of the match against Portugal.
"My thought coming in was I hope he'd be proud of us. He saw us grow up, and what we've achieved today," he said. "He's always in the back of our minds. When we achieve something, we think about him."
Speed was on the supporters' minds as well, with cries of "There's only one Speedo" heard at every game.
A friend of Speed's since childhood, Coleman says he thinks about his former team-mate every day, whether there is a fixture or not.
Succeeding his friend as Wales manager was a wrench for Coleman but there can be no doubt he and his players have done Speed proud.
Coleman said before the match against Portugal that this run to the semi-finals would not represent the end of his team's journey.
Absent from major tournaments for 58 years before Euro 2016, Wales are unwilling to endure another long wait.
The current crop of players is ripe for an era of regular qualifying, with Ashley Williams and James Collins the only players over 30 to start the match against Portugal. An average age of just over 27 means Wales' squad was the seventh youngest of the 24 teams at Euro 2016, and Coleman believes this tournament could be a springboard for further success.
"The one thing that will stop us from doing it again is ourselves," he said.
"We're good enough. We have to have the same hunger and desire, and we'll give the World Cup campaign a hell of a crack."
Wales will be back in action in September when they host Moldova in their opening qualifier for the 2018 World Cup.
Planning for that campaign can wait for now, though. With a homecoming parade taking place in Cardiff on Friday, Wales will take this opportunity to reflect on and revel in the magnitude of their achievement.
Just as they were at the final whistle in Lyon, Wales' players will be greeted by the great 'Red Wall' in Cardiff.
Returning home will feel like the end of the journey but, where Coleman and his players are concerned, this is not the final act.

Article: A heavy shower on Friday afternoon brought out the wellies, ponchos and umbrellas and created puddles on site.
Friday's acts include Florence and the Machine, Motorhead, Mark Ronson and an unconfirmed band, rumoured to be The Libertines, on the Pyramid Stage.
However, Professor Stephen Hawking is unlikely to attend the event for an appearance in the Kidz Field.
A spokesperson for the physicist told The Telegraph he had pulled out "for personal reasons".
In other Glastonbury news:
Organisers have not confirmed the identity of the act who will fill the Pyramid Stage slot on Friday that was left vacant when Florence Welch was promoted to the headline slot.
Rumours about Pete Doherty and Carl Barat's band The Libertines circulated after the name "Albion" was pictured on a backstage running order. The Libertines have used the word Albion frequently during their careers.
Florence has replaced Foo Fighters, who pulled out when frontman Dave Grohl broke his leg.
The decision to promote Florence and the Machine to headline status was criticised by some fans, but organiser Emily Eavis said she made the decision "straight away".
"This is her moment," Eavis said. "She's had a number one record in America, a number one record here, and she's on fire."
'Culture of rebellion'
Meanwhile, feminist punk band Pussy Riot made an appearance in front of the Park Stage, using a theatrical protest to convey their anti-government message.
The appearance began with an actor posing as a Russian soldier standing atop a military van and declaring Glastonbury a pro-Russian republic.
Pussy Riot's Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Maria Alyokhina, who were imprisoned in Russia for almost two years for their protests, then climbed up, tied him up and put one of their trademark multi-coloured balaclavas on him.
Tolokonnikova told the crowd to "develop a culture of rebellion" and, in a remark possibly aimed at other bands, said they could not just "sit on a comfy coach and drink some beer".
They were then interviewed on top of the van by singer Charlotte Church, who described them as "one of the most important movements this century".
A total of 177,000 people are due on site. The weather is expected to brighten up later, with Saturday expected to be sunny but more rain likely on Sunday.

Article: It is the second successive time the area has been at the bottom of the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD), which is published every four years.
Statisticians rate almost 7,000 areas in Scotland by standards including income, employability and health.
Lower Whitecraigs in East Renfrewshire is classed as the least deprived.
Glasgow has 56 of the 100 most deprived areas, down five on 2012.
Edinburgh has six, up two on four years ago.
The 10 most deprived areas in Scotland:
The 10 least deprived areas in Scotland:
Renfrewshire Council, which covers the area including Ferguslie Park, said a long-term plan to change the area's fortunes was already under way.
Council leader Mark Macmillan said: "The council has adopted an innovative approach to tackling poverty, recognised as leading the way in Scotland - and the SIMD stats are based on data from last year which does not fully capture the impact of that.
"The figures show the overall picture for Renfrewshire has improved and we believe we are making a difference on the ground.
"In the four years since the last SIMD figures were released, Renfrewshire has seen a 10% real-terms drop in the cash coming our way from Holyrood.
"The deprivation issues affecting Ferguslie and similar areas are long-term and deep-rooted - there are no easy solutions but through our unique approach, we believe we are on the right track."
The Scottish government said the figures showed "why Scotland needs a government committed to tackling deep-seated deprivation, poverty and inequalities".
Communities Secretary Angela Constance said: "This will not be an easy job while we do not have the full levers of power, but I am determined we take on the challenge of making a generational change for those areas that have been in poverty for too long.
"In the face of continuing UK government welfare cuts, an austerity agenda and attempts to take Scotland out of Europe, this will continue to be a long-term challenge."
She added: "We are spending Â£100m protecting people against the worst effects of welfare reform and every pound spent on mitigation measures is a pound less that can be spent on lifting people out of poverty."
The Scottish Conservatives said the figures should be a "wake-up call" to the SNP government.
Equalities spokeswoman Annie Wells said: "There are many causes of deprivation - poverty, family breakdown, drug and alcohol abuse, low educational standards and poor health and we now need a new approach.
"Powers need to be devolved from the Scottish government to enable cities and city-regions to work more closely together to regenerate and redevelop their local economies."
Scottish Labour's deputy leader Alex Rowley said: "If we are serious about cutting the gap between the richest and the rest we need to fully understand the picture of poverty in Scotland.
"These numbers are an important start - and they show a Scotland which remains too unequal, and further SNP cuts will only make it worse.
"The most deprived communities in Scotland will suffer more because of hundreds of millions of pounds of cuts to schools and local services, whilst our health boards are faced with millions of pounds of cuts because the SNP aren't giving our NHS the resources it needs."
Scottish Greens spokeswoman Alison Johnstone MSP said: "If we're to boost incomes, employment chances and health, we need to see greater ambition from Scottish ministers and local authorities. Yes, the Westminster government's continuing agenda of cuts plays a part, but we cannot let that stop us.
"We can push further on a real Living Wage across our economy, and we can boost people's health by committing to a major programme of housebuilding and energy efficiency measures, along with better public transport and cycling and walking infrastructure."
Analysis by Reevel Alderson, BBC Scotland Home affairs correspondent
The Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) is published every four years.
It provides the government and local authorities with a considerable amount of information aimed at helping them tackle the problem.
The index breaks Scotland down into 6,976 "datazones", effectively small postcode areas, and ranks levels of deprivation there on seven criteria.
These are: income, employment, health, education, housing, access to services and crime.
Overall scores are then provided for each datazone.
But that is not the full picture.
The statisticians say "deprived" does not just mean "poor" or "low income".
It can also mean people have fewer resources and opportunities, for example in health and education.
One area may score well on educational outcomes for example, but have poor health and access to services.
The Scottish government says this "allows effective analysis for targeting of policies and funding where the aim is to wholly or partly tackle or take account of area concentrations of multiple deprivation."

Ali, from the city's Barnes area, was found guilty after a trial at Newcastle Crown Court.
Det Insp Phil Bond said Ali had "preyed on his victim, befriending her and quickly gaining her trust before subjecting her to a horrific attack".
He said: "I hope the victim and her family can now move on from what has been an incredibly distressing time and can come to terms with what has happened and rebuild their lives.

Article: The move comes a day after the Cincinnati Zoo said it was "not amused" by enduring memes over the gorilla's death.
Staff members fatally shot Harambe in May after a three-year-old boy climbed into his enclosure.
The death was subject to controversy, prompting angry tweets and petitions.
Zoo 'not amused' by Harambe memes
Cincinnati Zoo director Thane Maynard said on Monday the staff was "still healing" from the incident and the outpour of online memes and satire was making it difficult to move on from Harambe's loss.
The 17-year-old gorilla's death sparked international outrage and the boy's mother faced online scrutiny regarding her parenting skills.
Prosecutors decided not to press charges against the mother.
The zoo reopened its Gorilla World exhibit in June. The exhibit included reinforced barrier designed to prevent further accidents.
But online, numerous memes, petitions and hashtags such as #JusticeForHarambe cropped up in the gorilla's honour. Over time, Harembe became popular shorthand in social media humour.
Some pranksters called for the animal to be put on the dollar bill, while a poll in Texas suggested he would receive 2% of the popular vote in the US presidential election.
The memes took a racist turn in June when retired Australian football player Adam Goodes and Ghostbusters actress Leslie Jones were compared to an image of Harambe.
Mr Maynard's Twitter account was also hacked over the weekend.
The zoo's Twitter account was continuously flooded with references to Harambe before it was erased on Tuesday. For every Tweet they posted, no matter the subject, the zoo received dozens of replies referencing the gorilla.

Article: Both teams remain in the bottom three after drawing 1-1 in the Tyne-Wear derby, with Aleksandar Mitrovic's late header earning Newcastle a point.
An increase in TV money means Premier League relegation could cost £100m.
"I think we will have to fight until the last game and the last minute, so we have to do it," said Benitez.
After spurning a one-goal lead for a second successive game, Allardyce said: "Put those four points on the board now and we are feeling like we are going to be surviving and we are going to stay safe.
"Now we are going to go right to the wire to try to stay safe, and that's the bottom line."
Mitrovic's 83rd-minute goal ended a run of six defeats against Sunderland and left the Magpies three points adrift of safety with eight games remaining.
Sunderland, who took the lead through Jermain Defoe's 15th goal of the season, are a point better off in 18th place, two points behind Norwich.
Newcastle travel to the Canaries after the international break with Sunderland also facing them at Carrow Road on 16 April.

After losing his first game at leaders Leicester, the result earned Benitez a first point since becoming Newcastle manager just over a week ago.
Asked if his team were now in a scary position, the former Real Madrid boss replied: "It was scary before. I am here because I have to give the team confidence and we have to improve things.
"We are creating chances, we are attacking, so we have to improve this part of the game and create more chances and Mitrovic or Papiss Cisse or the other strikers will score more goals and we will be fine."

Allardyce, whose team have not kept a clean sheet in 18 consecutive games in all competitions, said his team need four wins from their eight remaining games.
"If we don't start getting these clean sheets it's going to be a massive problem," he added.
"We are a team that has to score twice to win. Sadly we didn't get the second goal and we conceded late on again.
"In the second half, I don't know why we sat in and let Newcastle come at us. Maybe that was the size of the game, but in the end we haven't done that and it's two points dropped.
"We need four wins from the last eight, so it's now must-win rather than draw."

Article: Leroy Fer gave the hosts a first-half lead when he steered the ball home from close range at the back post after Baston Borja's knockdown from a corner.
Roberto Firmino levelled shortly after half-time when he headed in from Jordan Henderson's cross.
Milner netted the winner six minutes from time after Firmino was fouled.
The Liverpool midfielder's goal was just reward a dominant second half from his team, who have now won four Premier League games in a row.
It was, however, a little cruel on Swansea, whose spirited performance has probably bought Guidolin a little more time to turn things around.
The Swans are above the relegation zone on goal difference and have not won in the league since the opening day of the season.
But the club's owners had indicated before the game that the manner of performances would have as much of a bearing on Guidolin's future as the results.
Liverpool arrived in south Wales on a high, winning their past three league games and scoring 11 goals in the process.
Despite his side's fluency in attack, manager Jurgen Klopp had expressed concerns about the Reds' fragility from set-pieces, and his fears proved well founded as they fell behind in scrappy circumstances.
Rattled by their opponents' energetic pressing, Liverpool conceded a corner and, from it, Swansea's £15m record signing Borja headed across goal for Fer to turn the ball in from a yard out.
The ragged visitors could have conceded another had Borja not been so wayward with a free header - and Liverpool fans may have feared another hard lucky story, akin to their only defeat of the season at Burnley, on 20 August.
However, the visitors were vastly improved in the second half as they recaptured their recent impressive form and equalised thanks to more unsteady set-piece defending, as Firmino headed in from close range.
Klopp's side dominated from that point and, after they were initially thwarted by dogged Swansea defending, they eventually struck when Angel Rangel pushed Firmino in the back and Milner calmly converted the penalty.
In stark contrast to their high-flying opponents, Swansea entered the game in the midst of a torrid spell chairman Huw Jenkins described in the match programme as the hardest of his 12 years at the helm.
Guidolin's future remains in the balance, with his side just one point above the relegation zone and without a league win since beating Burnley on 13 August.
His players responded to his plight superbly, harassing Liverpool with a high-octane first-half display.
However, they were overwhelmed after the interval and were powerless to stop Guidolin suffering a third successive league defeat for the first time in his tenure.
His position is now as uncertain as ever.
Although Swansea's owners have started compiling a shortlist of potential successors in the event of Guidolin's sacking, they indicated beforehand that the Italian would be given time to turn the club's fortunes around.

After yet another game without a win, though, that time may be running out for Guidolin.
Swansea boss Francesco Guidolin:
"The players gave me a good answer. Our relationship is good. There is no problem between me and my players.
"I don't know [about the future]. It's not my decision. It's just for me to prepare for the game and the team. I know the situation. It's a possibility. The important thing is to prepare with patience.

"Before the game I saw the new owners Jason [Levien] and Steve [Kaplan] just to say 'hello'. I don't know if in the next day there's meeting."
Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp:
"I thought we could have done better in the first half. Our body language was not good, we were static and it was easy to defend against us. We are not as good as we should have been.
"You have to show why we are here. We showed a reaction, were more organised, clear in all situations and we deserved to win.  Of course I am happy we have had two or three brilliant games in a row.
"If Milner is our top scorer at end of the season with penalties, I have no problem with it. All is good. The performance was not perfect but it was good enough."

Article: Those banned are believed to include general secretary of the EU council Uwe Corsepius, and former British deputy prime minister Nick Clegg.
Russia shared the list after several requests by diplomats, the EU said.
The EU called the ban "totally arbitrary and unjustified" and said no explanation had been provided.
Many of those on the list are outspoken critics of the Kremlin, and some have been turned away from Russia in recent months.
The EU said that it had asked repeatedly for the list of those banned, but nothing had been provided until now.
"The list with 89 names has now been shared by the Russian authorities. We don't have any other information on legal basis, criteria and process of this decision," an EU spokesman said on Saturday.
"We consider this measure as totally arbitrary and unjustified, especially in the absence of any further clarification and transparency," he added.
A Russian foreign ministry official said that the ban was a result of EU sanctions against Russia.
"Why it was precisely these people who entered into the list... is simple - it was done in answer to the sanctions campaign which has been waged in relation to Russia by several states of the European Union," the official, who was not named, told Russian news agency Tass.
EU sanctions were imposed after Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea region in March 2014, and they have been extended amid ongoing fighting between government troops and pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine.
Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told journalists on Friday that the list had been shared with EU diplomats and that three Dutch politicians were on it. He said that the Netherlands would not abide by the ban as it was "not based on international law".
British intelligence chiefs appear to have been targeted, with a leaked version of the list (in German)naming MI5 director general Andrew Parker and the former MI6 chief Sir John Sawers.
Former British foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind told the AFP news agency that he had "read the reports in the media [of his ban] but not a word from the Russians".
Britain's foreign office said: "The Russian authorities have not provided any legal basis for the list or for the names on it.
"If Russia thinks this action will cause the EU to change its position on sanctions, it is wrong."
Also on the list are the French philosopher Bernard-Henri Levy, former Belgian prime minister Guy Verhofstadt and the EU's former enlargement chief Stefan Fule.
'A decent club'
Sweden's foreign minister, Margot Wallstrom said that her country has asked for an explanation from Russia.
Eight Swedes are on the list, including Swedish MEP Anna Maria Corazza Bildt.
"I'm more proud than scared and this gives me more determination to continue... If the Kremlin takes me and my colleagues seriously it means we're doing a good job," she told AFP.
The former Czech foreign minister, Karel Schwarzenberg, also said he was pleased to have made the list.
"When I saw the other names (on the list), I found out I was in a very decent club. I consider this a reward," he was quoted as saying by the CTK news agency.
Other countries with names on the list reportedly include Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Czech Republic, Romania, Bulgaria and Spain.

Article: It's hard to tell which blow took us more by surprise, the first ever positive steroids test in the history of Scottish rugby, or the fact that  and think it's unfair that so many Scottish, Welsh and Irish teams qualify for the Heineken Cup from a league without relegation.
But let's start with  to bulk up and get on in rugby, and leave the Heineken Cup for another day.
The public statement made by Sam Chalmers, son of one of our finest ever players Craig, is that he is sorry and that he got the stuff off the internet. It has shades of the convenient "lone wolf" theory about it. Was he the only player to get this stuff? Did he talk to other players about it?
Coaches involved in age-group rugby tell me that weight training and supplements appear to be going hand in hand
Here is my thinking: I buy the argument that players are under pressure to get big. I buy the argument that players are under pressure to get heavier too. The rugby pitch has stayed the same size for 150 years while humans have changed. Rugby is more about going through people than round them now.
What I don't buy is that players are under pressure to buy steroids. It's cheating. The moment you buy the things you are cheating. You know it's not allowed. You are hoping the drug testers never get to you.
Some players may have contemplated taking steroids but chosen not to do so. If you're not big enough then choose another profession. It's not a game for all shapes and sizes any more.
Coaches involved in age-group rugby tell me that weight training and supplements appear to be going hand in hand. Young players go to the gym after taking supplements, they drink supplements during their training, and immediately afterwards.
Perhaps they are being indoctrinated into thinking that there is no way to do this consuming food alone. Maybe, just maybe, the logical next step from that is that artificial aids help, and the last resort - and illegal - artificial aid is your steroid of choice.
So is it possible to get big enough taking food alone?
The IRB has its latest drug test figures on its website. It states: "The IRB carried out 1,542 tests both in and out of competition in 2012, across all IRB tournaments and events, including the HSBC Sevens World Series, Rugby World Cup 2015 qualifiers, men's and women's Tests and Age Grade Rugby.
"The programme saw a total of 21 anti-doping rule violation cases, equating to 1.36% of the IRB's entire programme."
That means around 1.4% of elite level players take drugs and try to get away with it. Some of them, you can see from the website, were caught taking the steroid favoured by both Sam Chalmers and disgraced Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson, stanozolol.
The 2011 Word Anti-Doping Agency figures, also available on the IRB website, show there were 5,553 drug tests globally in rugby in 2011, and 61 violations within them - just over 1%.
My guess is that there are more chancing it lower down the leagues, or in that scramble to get into the system - but I don't know.
When I was in South Africa covering the 1995 Rugby World Cup I wrote then what I repeat now - that the biggest growth in requests at GPs in Capetown nearly 20 years ago was from schoolboys wanting prescriptions for steroids. They were often accompanied by parents.
Could this happen here?
Sam Chalmers was in the most susceptible group, which is young lads who want to get into professional, or at least top-level, rugby.
It's going to be tough on him. But life's not easy. It wasn't easy for the players and coaches in the "Bloodgate" affair, or in the various eye-gouging allegations, nor for the other 60-odd rugby players caught by the IRB taking drugs or tampering with their samples.
This is a test. He does his time and then he gets back in the game.
I will leave you with this thought: I bet you he wasn't alone in this. And I bet there are younger players than Sam Chalmers who haven't been caught.
What do you think? Are there pressures on players to take steroids?

Article: Doors to the event at Glasgow Green will open at 14:00.
TRNSMT is being held on what was traditionally the weekend of the T in the Park festival, which is not taking place this year.
Other bands appearing over the weekend include include Kasabian, Biffy Clyro and The Kooks.
The acts will play across three stages at Scotland's newest music festival, with highlights being broadcast every evening on a BBC Scotland programme presented by Edith Bowman.
Radiohead will headline the opening night, with Kasabian headlining on Saturday and Biffy Clyro closing the festival on Sunday.
Organisers DF Concerts announced TRNSMT in January, two months after saying it was suspending T in the Park to "take stock" of a challenging two years since the festival moved to Strathallan from Balado.
The promoter said "continued restrictions" had had a "negative impact" on festival-goers.
T in the Park's first year at Strathallan in 2015 was plagued by traffic problems.
Two teenagers died at the 2016 festival in separate incidents, while witnesses reported fights and illicit drug use in the campsite area.
Police Scotland said on Wednesday that security would be tight at TRNSMT following the recent terror attacks in Manchester and London, with armed police patrolling near the venue and bag searchers being carried out on festival-goers.
Officers also warned there would be a zero-tolerance approach to drug-taking and anyone found with illegal substances would be arrested.
Flares, smoke devices and other pyrotechnics are banned from the festival area and anyone who is drunk will not be allowed entry.

Article: The reactor at Yongbyon has been the source of plutonium for North Korea's nuclear weapons programme.
The White House said North Korea should "focus instead on fulfilling its international obligations".
The reactor was shut down in 2007 as part of a disarmament-for-aid deal.
But Pyongyang vowed to restart it in 2013, following its third nuclear test and amid high regional tensions.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the international community would not accept North Korea as a nuclear state.
"We will work with our partners in the context of the six-party talks to try to return North Korea to a posture of fulfilling those commitments that they have made," he said.
"We will repeat our call that North Korea should refrain from the irresponsible provocations that aggravate regional tension and should focus instead on fulfilling its international obligations and commitments."
Six-nation talks involving South Korea, the US, China, Japan and Russia aimed at ending the North's nuclear programme have been stalled since 2009.
Experts believe that, when fully operational, the Yongbyon reactor can make one nuclear bomb's worth of plutonium per year.
A US think-tank said this year that satellite images suggested work had started at the Yongbyon complex.
But Tuesday's announcement was the first official confirmation from North Korea that it had restarted operations there.
The state-run news agency KCNA said North Korea was improving its nuclear weapons "in quality and quantity".
It said that the North was ready to face US hostility with "nuclear weapons any time".
However, experts say North Korea's nuclear capabilities are unclear.
Pyongyang claims it has made a device small enough to fit a nuclear warhead on to a missile, which it could launch at its enemies. But US officials have cast doubt on the claim.
North Korea has made bellicose threats against its neighbours and the US before, often to coincide with annual joint military exercises held by South Korea and US forces.
The two Koreas remain technically at war, because the 1950-1953 war ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.

He said: "I hope the victim and her family can now move on from what has been an incredibly distressing time and can come to terms with what has happened and rebuild their lives.

Article: Andrew Bedford, 27, from Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire, was last seen in September 1990.
Officers reopened the investigation in April, and discovered human bones on land off Stocking Fen Road in Ramsey.
A 64-year-old man from Ramsey has been arrested.
Mr Bedford was last seen on the evening of 28 September at Factory Bank, off Great Whyte, Ramsey.
Three people were arrested in connection with his disappearance but no-one was charged.
In April, Cambridgeshire Police reopened the investigation as a murder inquiry, saying they believed he had been shot.
Detectives think Mr Bedford was killed with a shotgun sometime during the evening of 28 September at a garage called Mongrel Cars, which no longer exists, in Ramsey.
They began searching land in the town in April.
Bones "consistent with being human" were found by scenes of crime officers, forensic scientists and detectives during the 13-day operation.
Det Ch Insp Martin Brunning, who is leading the murder inquiry, said: "The bones were discovered during a painstaking search of the area we had identified as being of interest.
"An expert in forensic anthropology has assisted the investigation and the bones will now be subject to DNA testing and much more intrusive forensic analysis."
Mr Bedford was last seen eating a takeaway in a light blue Ford Cortina car.
He was wearing overalls, a khaki jumper, jeans and trainers. He was described as 5ft 8in (1.72m), medium build with mousey blond, curly, shoulder-length hair and had a number of tattoos.
Mr Brunning said he was "confident" local people held additional information that would help "bring resolution to Andrew's family".

Article: "Did you set this up?" Salford City Reds owner Dr Marwan Koukash asked, at the start of the station's rugby league hour this week.
The extravagant millionaire has grabbed the ailing Reds by the scruff of the neck and set about building a dream in arguably the sport's most crucial year.
Having ruffled feathers with his breathtakingly bold bids to sign Sam Tomkins and Adrian Morley, Koukash has promised to make the Super League strugglers the biggest rugby club in the country within three to four years. What he has definitely done is make people talk about Salford again.
Far from being a prickly atmosphere in the studio, there appeared to be real warmth between the extrovert racehorse owner, the man he wants to coach his club - Brian Noble, and the rugby league legend he wants to sign from Warrington - Adrian Morley.
"The more Marwan's the merrier, the better," said Noble, the former Great Britain and Bradford Bulls coach still waiting for the right opportunity to return to the sport. "You just need passionate people with some substance behind them to push the game forward. His passion fills you with enthusiasm, you want to get going and get cracking."
Those comments will have been music to the ears of the fiercely ambitious Koukash, who learned the art of hard work during three years in a refugee camp in Jordan.
He admits he would be honoured for Noble to coach the team he is attempting to assemble at Salford. Another Brian - the Australian Brian Smith - is the other frontrunner.
I understand Noble is keen to work with Koukash, but only if he is convinced the dream of this businessman, tempted into the sport by the RFL's chief executive Nigel Wood, can become a reality.
A similar discussion about ambition and available funds saw Noble drop out of the running for the Castleford Tigers job before the appointment of Ian Millward, so Salford fans should not expect this to be a done deal.
Key to the 'Good Doctor's' dream - he was labelled the 'Mad Doctor' during his outlandish early claims of racehorse success - is his campaign to raise the sport's £1.8m salary cap. Koukash has, for the past few weeks, been lobbying to lift the limit that a club can spend on players to something nearer £2.5m.
His argument is that this will not only make the rugby league a more attractive proposition for the best players in Australia and halt a talent drain to rugby union, but even reverse the process and tempt union players to league.
Noble agrees that the cap may need a rethink - it was introduced to stop clubs overspending. But the only man to coach a club to three Super League Grand Final victories believes we might now need a carrot to bring in the bigger names to raise the sport's profile.
How much of a financial risk would this be?
This is a time the sport cannot even attract a title sponsor for Super League - a situation branded unacceptable by the St Helens chairman Eamonn McManus, who cites his own club's deal with tea-makers Typhoo as proof that the sport can pull in the blue-chip brands.
Media playback is not supported on this device
Koukash clearly has cash and he wants to be able to spend it. But not every club is in a position to chase success in this way.
Morley suggests there should be a loophole introduced to have two or three "star name" players paid as much as you like outside of the salary cap.
Koukash added: "There should be a mechanism in the sport to allow certain scenarios, clubs or situations to go and spend above the cap."
The man who made his millions from racehorses clearly feels he will be unable to attract rugby league's thoroughbreds to Salford under the current guidelines.
Such an argument is unlikely to be met with a huge nod of approval from the likes of Leeds chief executive Gary Hetherington who has built his own successful business model on a strict sliding salary scale at the Super League champions.
The bigger question of course is that of the sport's profile in World Cup year. McManus says this is rugby league's "biggest single financial weakness".
This is not a question about allowing Salford to sign as many players as they want. It is about maximising the exposure of the sport to the world and reaping the financial rewards of that.
McManus says the game's governing body needs to take responsibility. "No sponsor is not acceptable. Either from the club's perspective or from that of the governing body," he said.
"Someone has to be answerable for that. It is something none of us are happy with and someone needs to be accountable."
McManus feels that if these weaknesses in the way the game is marketed are "readily identified and dealt with" then the game has never been in a stronger position to prosper and grow. Koukash will expect to be at the forefront of that.

Article: Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj said Kulbhushan Jadhav was "kidnapped" and tried on "concocted charges".
Mr Jadhav was arrested last year and convicted on Monday of "espionage and sabotage activities against Pakistan".
Shortly after his arrest, Islamabad released a video in which he was shown admitting involvement in spying.
India has always questioned the alleged confession, saying that it was extracted under duress.
There are differing accounts of how and where Kulbhushan Jadhav was detained.
Pakistan says he was detained on 3 March 2016 in the restive Balochistan province, which has been hit by a separatist insurgency that Islamabad accuses India of backing. India says he was kidnapped by Pakistan while he was in Iran.
Speaking in the Indian parliament on Tuesday, Ms Swaraj described the death sentence as "an indefensible verdict" and warned Pakistan to "consider the consequences".
Home Minister Rajnath Singh promised that the government would do "whatever it takes to make sure Mr Jadhav gets justice".
On Monday, Pakistan said he had been tried by a military court and sentenced to death.
Pakistan said he told the court he had been ordered to "plan, coordinate, and organise espionage/sabotage activities aiming to destabilise and wage war against Pakistan".
He has 40 days to appeal to the court, Pakistani media report. No date was given for his execution.
The nuclear-armed neighbours have a long history of diplomatic spats and Delhi and Islamabad often accuse each other of sending spies into their territories.
In November, Pakistan withdrew six officials from its mission in Delhi after they were outed as suspected spies by India.
It later leaked to the press the names and photos of eight alleged Indian spies working from India's mission in Islamabad.
But executions for spying are rare. In 1999, Pakistan hanged Sheikh Shamim 10 years after his conviction for spying.
Sarabjit Singh, an Indian man sentenced to death for spying in 1991, died in prison in 2013 while on death row after an attack by other prisoners.

Article: St Davids in Pembrokeshire and Swansea both hope to inherit the title from Hull in 2021.
The Swansea bid team said it wanted to match the £33m spent by Hull, while St Davids has a £20m programme in place.
City of Culture is awarded by the UK government every four years - providing the winner with an opportunity to raise its profile and draw investment.
In Hull's case, the council put in about £3.5m with the rest coming from local and central government, the Arts Council, Lottery funding and businesses in the city.
The winning city also gets to host high-profile national events such as the Turner Prize for contemporary art and Radio 1's Big Weekend.
The Department of Culture Media and Sport is considering 11 bids for 2021 and the shortlist of four is due to be announced in July.
An independent panel, chaired by Brookside creator Phil Redmond, will then assess the final bids before a winner is chosen at the end of the year.
St Davids' bid is being led by Pembrokeshire council.
Chief executive Tegryn Jones told the Eye on Wales programme: "I think we've got a number of themes. The background of pilgrimage is very strong amongst those.  Another obvious aspect is the coastline and the natural environment.
"There are fantastic opportunities to put art in the landscape. One of the ideas is to have a cycling cinema, where people turn up on their bikes and power the film by using their bicycles."
Swansea made the final shortlist before losing out to Hull in the 2017 competition.
The council's head of cultural services, Tracey McNulty, said: "We have a bit of a history of people who took risks and lead to world-first innovation. Also we have this stunning landscape but we've also got areas which are facing deprivation.
"We're really playing with that 'lovely, ugly' Swansea that Dylan Thomas describes."
Hull estimates being UK Capital of Culture helped unlock £3bn of capital investment in the city.
The £33m was spent on such things as education, volunteering and legacy as well as a 365-day programme of events.
Martin Green, director of Hull City of Culture 2017, said: "One of the things that we've clearly seen in this city is that pride has hit the roof.
"Proud cities are confident cities. And confident cities can do anything they like."

Article: Colchester Hospital was rated as inadequate after a recent Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspection found it was relying on "unsuitable" agency staff.
Norman Betchley died in 2009 after he was mistakenly fed a pill by an agency nurse.
The hospital said the CQC report did not reflect improvements it has made.
Inspectors said the hospital demonstrated "poor leadership" and "only a limited capacity to improve".
Staff were let down by agency workers, who were not as committed and were "unsuitable in terms of their skills and knowledge".
Mr Betchley's daughter Linda said she feels angry that "nothing has changed" since he died.
More on this story on BBC Local Live in Essex
She added: "At the time they said there was a deficit in trained staff and there was a breakdown in management and the girl was thrown in at the deep end.
"Many of the items raised in this most recent report were raised back then. I don't see them being addressed soon.
"There is no leadership, there is no support for the actual nurses on the wards."
Chief executive Frank Sims, who started in the role last month, admitted its biggest challenge is "reducing our dependency on agency staff."
"We have got more staff employed now than we have ever had, and since September we have recruited 75 more qualified nurses but we have still got a long way to go."
The trust which runs the hospital has been in special measures since 2013.
The CQC has recommended it remains in special measures for the next three months, during which time it must submit a weekly improvement plan.
Mr Sims said his intention is to "focus entirely on getting out of special measures this year".

Article: Philippe Bianchi told France Info radio his son, who remains in a coma, had shown "no significant progress" since crashing into a recovery vehicle last October at Suzuka.
"In general, progress needs to be made in the first six months," Bianchi said.
"It has been nine months now and Jules has still not woken up."
Frenchman Jules Bianchi, 25, continues to receive treatment for his severe injuries in hospital in his home city of Nice.
Philippe Bianchi added: "As time goes by, I am less optimistic than I might have been two or three months after the accident when we could have hoped for better progress."
Bianchi admitted that if Jules did awake from his coma, it could lead to added difficulties.
He revealed that, prior to his son's accident, the two had spoken about the condition of seven-time Formula 1 world champion Michael Schumacher, who suffered severe head injuries in a skiing accident in December 2013 and faces a long road to recovery.
Philippe Bianchi said: "If he had a severe handicap, we are convinced that is not what Jules would want.
"We talked about it. He discussed with us that if one day he had an accident like that of Michael Schumacher, that even if his only handicap was not being able to drive, he would have a lot of difficulty living. Because it was his life."
Jules Bianchi joined Marussia in 2013 and raced in 34 grands prix, scoring two championship points in last year's Monaco Grand Prix.
Marussia came close to collapse over the winter but were rescued and are racing as Manor in 2015.

Cavendish, who has won 30 stages at the Tour de France, came sixth in the first of six events - the scratch race.
He was second fastest in the individual pursuit and seventh in the elimination race with three more events on Monday.
Becky James broke the women's sprint Olympic record in qualification and is in Monday's quarter-finals along with fellow Briton Katy Marchant.
Cavendish, 31, began his campaign with a hard-fought sixth-placed finish in the scratch race, after Denmark's Lasse Norman Hansen, the London 2012 Olympic champion and Roger Kluge took the top two spots by gaining a lap on the field.
In the individual pursuit, Cavendish recorded a time of four minutes 16.878 seconds and caught reigning world champion Colombian Fernando Gaviria Rendon in the process.
That temporarily gave the Manxman the outright lead, before Hansen set a new Olympic record of 4:14:982, beating Sir Bradley Wiggins' time set in 2008, to win his second event in a row.
However, Hansen dropped from first to sixth overall after he was the first rider to fall out of the elimination race which sees the rider in last position at the end of every second lap ejected from the race.
Cavendish was looking comfortable as other riders dropped out but he was ejected, despite not being the last rider over the line, when he overtook a rider while off the inside of the track, and was awarded seventh place.
France's Thomas Boudat, the 2014 world champion, leads on 106 points, two more than Italy's Elia Viviani who won the elimination race, with Cavendish third on 96 points.
The fourth event - the time trial - starts at 14:21 BST on Monday, before the flying lap and points race events.
Wales' James won a silver medal in the keirin on Saturday and maintained her good form on Sunday as she set a new Olympic record during the sprint qualification.
James recorded a time of 10.721 seconds to beat the 10.724 set by fellow Briton Victoria Pendleton at the 2012 Olympics in London.
That saw James become the fastest qualifier and she comfortably beat Olga Ismayilova of Azerbaijan by a margin of 0.165 secs to move into the quarter-finals, which take place from 14:00 BST on Monday.
Marchant also advanced in style as she defeated Canada's Monique Sullivan after posting the second fastest qualification time.

Article: Finance Minister Máirtín Ó Muilleoir made the announcement as part of a reallocation of funds known as a monitoring round.
He said that when added to the last monitoring round it means the executive has allocated an additional £200m to health in 2016/17.
Health accounts for about half of Stormont's departmental spending.
Last week, Health Minister Michelle O'Neill said her department needed "significant additional funding" to meet growing demand.
When asked on Tuesday if any of the money would be allocated to waiting lists, Ms O'Neill said she "would make her decisions on the allocations of the additional resources as soon as possible within the next few days".
So how will the money be spent?
At this stage there is little detail. However, from the health minister's statement it seems that the money will go directly to unscheduled care which includes emergency departments.
It will also be directed to those areas within hospitals which often experience bed blocking - when patients cannot be discharged as there is nowhere for them to be cared for in the community, including in their own homes.
Read more.
Other reallocations include £30m to schools with £5m of that for special educational needs.
There is also £25m for roads maintenance and building schemes and £20m for further education.
Mr Ó Muilleoir said there have been no new spending cuts despite pressure on budgets "as a result of the Westminster austerity agenda".
A large slice of the money which has been reallocated is £30m which had been set aside to mitigate cuts to tax credits.
However, the money is no longer needed for that purpose after the chancellor reversed his plan to cut tax credits.

Article: A government spokesman said the bodies were found near the city of Al Bayda, close to the site of the kidnapping.
The crew was taken in August while travelling through territory largely controlled by extremist militants.
Libya has been in turmoil since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and now has two competing governments and numerous militia groups.
Faraj al-Barassi, a district army commander in eastern Libya, told Reuters that militants loyal to Islamic State (IS) were responsible for the killings.
IS-affiliated militants have established a strong presence in parts of Libya, including Derna where the kidnapping is believed to have taken place.
Parts of Libya have descended into lawless chaos following the overthrow of Gaddafi, allowing extremists to gain ground.
A February report by Human Rights Watch said there was a "climate of impunity" in the country that "allowed militias to assault, threaten, kidnap, or even kill journalists".
Libya's internationally recognised government has fled from the capital Tripoli to the eastern city of Tobruk, while a rival parliament has been established in Tripoli itself.

Article: Just days after dropping a supreme court action, the twins filed a fresh lawsuit against the company.
It claims that Facebook "intentionally or inadvertently suppressed evidence" during their previous litigation.
Originally, Tyler and Cameron accused Mr Zuckerberg of stealing their idea to create the site.
The story of the feud formed the core of the 2010 film "The Social Network".
The row dates from 2003 when the Winklevosses hired Mr Zuckerberg to write code for their ConnectU site while at Harvard.
He never did, but instead set up Facebook, which quickly became a success around the world.
A court case over who did what was resolved in 2008 when the parties agreed on a financial settlement, reportedly worth around $65m (Â£41m).
In January 2011 the Winklevosses tried to reopen the case, seeking more money. However, a US appeals court ruled in April that they would have to accept the settlement.
The twins initially said they would appeal against the settlement, but decided this week not to pursue that legal avenue.
In the most recent suit filed on Thursday with the US District Court of Massachusetts, the Winklevosses and their business partner Divya Narendra said that Facebook hid some crucial information from them during settlement proceedings.
The twins said that Mr Zuckerberg did not disclose some important documents in regards to the relationship between him and the brothers while they were at Harvard.
Facebook's outside counsel Neel Chatterjee said in a statement: "These are old and baseless allegations that have been considered and rejected previously by the courts."

Article: The Gold Hill Cheese Run sees entrants run up the cobbled Shaftesbury street with a 55lb (25kg) cheese.
The event, based on activities of cheese traders in years gone by, began in 2012 as part of the town's food festival.
Barnaby Cox, 18, who has won the race twice, has put his success down to "technique and power".
Organiser Charlie Turnbull said the event was a tribute to a millennia of cheese making in the Blackmore Vale, with "slightly mad" participants racing with the locally-made cheeses which are 35cm (14") in diameter.
"Each one takes up to 500 pints of milk - that's a lot of effort from a lot of cows. But they are not very convenient to carry up a hill."
The street was made famous when it was used in a Hovis bread television advertisement filmed by Ridley Scott in 1973.
It depicted a boy struggling to get up the street on his bicycle to deliver bread to the sounds of Antonin Dvorak's New World Symphony.

Article: As defence correspondent of the Daily Express he beat his rivals to a string of scoops.
One of his great strengths was the ability to remember minute details without having to make a single note.
After his retirement he published a series of books alleging Britain's security services had been penetrated by spies at the top level.
Harry Chapman Pincher, son of an Army officer, was born in India on 29 March 1914.
He went to Darlington Grammar School and London University, and graduated  in zoology and botany.
Ironically while at university, some fellow students tried to sign him up to the Soviet cause.
"I said to one: 'In the event of a successful revolution, how would the new England be governed?'
"He said: 'To start with it would be governed from Moscow.'
"So I said: 'Well, bugger that.'"
Pincher worked as a teacher before joining the Royal Armoured Corps in 1940. He moved to the Rocket Division of the Ministry of Supply in 1943.
After the war he secured a job with the Daily Express as defence, science and medical editor.
One of his best contacts, the chief scientist at the Ministry of Defence in the 1950s, was keen to tell him as much as possible about Britain's atomic weapons programme.
He wanted to explain to the public why the country was spending such massive sums of money on it.
"I'm up for use any time," he said. "If someone wants to come and tell me some news that nobody else knows and I make a lovely scoop of it, come on, use me!"
But it never worried him that he was being used by senior figures with ideas to promote or scores to settle.
His investigative methods were unorthodox. Mainly he bought people agreeable lunches and, over the claret, senior civil servants and politicians would tell him things.
His favourite lunch venue was a classy French restaurant called L'Ecu de France in Jermyn Street off Piccadilly, handy both for Fleet Street and for the civil servants and politicians in Westminster.
Only after it closed did he learn that the place had been bugged by MI5 since the 1940s. (It had also, MI5 discovered when removing its own hidden microphones, been bugged by the KGB.)
"MI5 heard every conversation that I had and they did nothing about it," he said.
"All they did was put it in the files. MI5 doesn't like to take any action; they like to know.
"'It's in the files: if we take action, they'll know we know.' That's the attitude. It's absolutely crazy."
Pincher cultivated contacts not only at the lunch table but in the countryside.
In the 1950s he took up game shooting, and met a good many useful sources while banging away in plus-fours at pheasant and grouse.
Lord Mountbatten, aloof and unapproachable as first sea lord and chief of the defence staff, turned out to be much friendlier when Pincher encountered him shooting.
"He invited me to shoot at Broadlands and even dictated a story to me once when I was travelling in his Land Rover, which went straight into the newspaper... but under my name, not his."
In 1964 he brought into the open the scandal over Ferranti's Â£5 million profit on Bloodhound missiles, which were the major weapon in Britain's air defences.
This was a colossal sum at the time and a subsequent inquiry saw the company refunding more than Â£4 million to the Treasury.
In 1971, Pincher revealed how the number of staff at the Soviet embassy had increased significantly and claimed that most of the diplomats, chauffeurs and gardeners were really spies.
This prompted Edward Heath's government to expel 105 of them, which seriously damaged the Soviet Union's espionage capability.
After his retirement, Pincher's most controversial book was Their Trade is Treachery. This revealed the head of MI5 until 1965, Sir Roger Hollis, had been investigated as a suspected Soviet spy.
There was an immense furore, which Pincher doubtless found most gratifying.
In the years since, Pincher hardened his line on Hollis, and continued researching the subject becoming convinced that Hollis actually was a Soviet mole.
Not everyone agrees. Christopher Andrew, MI5's official historian, thinks it's nonsense to suggest Hollis was a traitor.
Rupert Allason, who writes about espionage under the pen name Nigel West, is more nuanced. "Some people don't believe there was any hostile penetration of the security service.
"Personally I've seen the evidence: I know there was penetration up until at least September 1963.
"Where I part company with Harry is on the issue of candidates. He believes it was Sir Roger Hollis, I'm not convinced of that; but I am persuaded there was a mole."
One of the main sources for Pincher's book was the former MI5 agent Peter Wright, whose book Spycatcher was the subject of a long court case to try to prevent publication.
Margaret Thatcher's government was infuriated by Their Trade is Treachery; but then angering prime ministers was nothing new to Pincher.
In May 1959, Conservative Prime Minister Harold Macmillan wrote a personal minute, marked "secret", to his minister of defence.
"I do not understand," he wrote, "how the Express alone of all the newspapers has got the exact decision that we reached at the cabinet last Thursday on space. Can nothing be done to suppress or get rid of Mr Chapman Pincher?
"I am getting very concerned about how well informed he always seems to be on defence matters."
And the Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson contributed to what may have been Pincher's finest moment in 1967.
What became known as "the D notice affair" began with a "walk-in", a member of the public who turns up at a newspaper's front door with a possible scoop.
The information given to Pincher was that all private cables and Post Office telegrams were being intercepted and that some were being read by GCHQ.
Before publishing the story, Pincher checked with a contact called Lt Col Sammy Lohan, secretary of the D notice committee.
The D notice system is a voluntary one, designed to alert the news media to stories that might damage national security if published.
Lohan told Pincher his story was not covered by any D notices, and the Express went ahead and printed the scoop.
Wilson was furious and set up an inquiry to show that D notices had in fact been breached. The inquiry concluded the exact opposite, and vindicated the Express.
In his Who's Who entry, Pincher listed ferreting in Whitehall and bolting politicians as two of his recreations.
He said he didn't regret a single thing he had found out and printed.
"I always tried to meet all the top people because that's where the stories lay," he said.
"When you have access to people you have access to facts, usually secret facts."

The names will be announced during the One Show on BBC One between 19:00 and 19:30 GMT.
A capacity crowd of about 12,000 will attend the show at the First Direct Arena in Leeds on Sunday, 15 December.
The programme will follow on from last year's awards where Sir Bradley Wiggins was crowned 2012 Sports Personality.
Full roll of honour
After Tuesday's announcement, there will be details of all the contenders and arrangements for public voting on the night at www.bbc.co.uk/sportspersonality.
Tour de France winner and Olympic road cycling champion Wiggins was the latest to join an illustrious roll of honour last year when he received the coveted trophy from the Duchess of Cambridge and former England football captain David Beckham, watched on television by more than 15m people.
Presenter Gary Lineker said: "It's going to be tough to follow last year, the most unbelievable sporting year in living memory, but the fact that it is the 60th anniversary, the fact that it is coming to Leeds, means it's still going to be a huge show."
Director of BBC Sport Barbara Slater added: "We're thrilled Leeds is to host BBC Sports Personality of the Year 2013. The sporting heritage of the city is outstanding and the new arena will be a great venue from which to celebrate the very best of sport."
Devised by Sir Paul Fox in 1954, the first Sports Personality of the Year was held at the Savoy Hotel in London, where it was presented by Peter Dimmock. World record-breaking 5,000m runner Sir Christopher Chataway beat four minute-mile hero Sir Roger Bannister to the award that year as the public voted for the first winner.
The trophy has since been won by many of the greats of British sport, including Bobby Moore, Princess Anne, Lord Coe, Daley Thompson, Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean, Sir Steve Redgrave, David Beckham, Dame Kelly Homes, Andrew Flintoff, Sir Chris Hoy and many more.

The show went on the road in 2006, taking in Birmingham, Liverpool, Sheffield, Manchester and London. To date, more than 55,000 people have enjoyed spending a spectacular evening with the stars of the sporting year.
Lineker added: "Taking the show out on the road has worked really well. It has proven to be hugely popular. You get thousands of people who can come along and enjoy the live show and it just becomes more of an event.
"When you get the people there who really want to be there - the supporters, the sports fans - it just adds to the atmosphere and I'm sure it will be the same in Leeds."
Most tickets for the event have been sold, although a limited number will be made available later in November.

With darkness falling, and your parents calling you in for tea, you squeeze in one last penalty to win the FA Cup, one last drop-kick to win the Rugby World Cup, one last putt to win The Masters.
Two Yorkshiremen had those same moments growing up around Sheffield in the early part of the century. This time last year, they made one a reality.
Danny Willett may have hit the drives and holed the putts that made him the first Englishman since Nick Faldo in 1996 to win the Masters and don the famous Green Jacket, but his caddie Jonathan Smart is claiming a bit of the credit.
In a documentary - When Danny Won The Masters, to be shown on BBC Two at 15:00 BST on Sunday, 2 April - the friends share their memories of an unforgettable Sunday afternoon playing the back nine at Augusta National.
Willett, playing with fellow Englishman and friend Lee Westwood, began the final round three shots adrift of defending champion Jordan Spieth, who was four groups behind him on the course.
The 29-year-old, who was only playing in the tournament because his son Zachariah was born a week early, takes up the tale on the 10th tee...
Danny: We were two under through the first nine but we were still three shots behind Jordan.
Jonny: We made an unbelievable par save on the ninth; it was the smelliest nine-footer down the hill and it kept us going. Then we had our funniest moment of the week walking down the 10th fairway. Danny said: "We're in contention on Sunday at the Masters." We were like little kids. We were laughing, not in disbelief, but at realising the situation we were in.
Danny: I hit two lovely shots on 10 and made par.
Danny: Everyone knows how difficult 11, 12 and 13 are with the wind swirling between the trees. I hit two lovely shots on 11 and made par, found the front edge on the par-three 12th and made par. We stepped on to the 13th tee and Jordan had birdied the eighth and ninth and stretched out to a five-shot lead.
The tee shot on the par-five 13th is really difficult for me because I hit a fade and it needs a draw. We hit three wood all week and almost played it as a three-shotter, but on Sunday Jonny and I said, 'If we're going to do anything we need to try and force it a little bit'. So I stepped up and gunned it. A little five-yard draw with the driver round the corner.
Jonny: Dan is adamant that was his best shot of the week.
Danny: I then hit five iron to the middle of the green and had a two-putt birdie but while I was doing that, Jordan had bogeyed 10.
Danny: I hit a nice drive down the right on 14 and a wedge to four feet and made birdie again. Jordan bogeyed 11.
Jonny: It was a four-footer that was straight downhill but I wasn't sure if it was going to break, it wasn't obvious. Nothing is said, we both know we've got to keep pushing. Those two holes were massive for us.
Willett improves to -4, Spieth drops to -5
Danny: The next time we see the leaderboard, Lee Westwood has just chipped in for eagle from the back of the 15th green to get within one of us.
Jonny: Everything went ballistic. We had another birdie chance but that shot from Westy brought another player into it. I had goosebumps because the fans on the 16th can also see everything and the sound was ridiculous.
Danny: I had a 10-12-footer from the back edge. I thought that was to tie the lead. I missed it but tapped in for par. John put the flag in, walked back, said 'that was a good effort' and then we heard all the oohs and aahs from the gallery.
Media playback is not supported on this device
Jonny: I'll never forget walking to the 16th tee. I saw people in the gallery putting their head in their hands and we turned around and saw they were changing the big scoreboard.
Danny: It's just off the back right of 15 and Jordan had gone from five under to one under on the par-three 12th and we were at four under. So we looked at each other and waited for them to change the score because we thought they've got it wrong. After five or 10 steps, we realised we were at four, Westwood at three and Jordan at one.
Jonny: That's when things got a little bit more interesting.
Danny: I'd been dying for the bathroom so I ran down past the 16th tee and everyone's saying 'look at the leaderboard, you're leading the Masters'. I'm in the bathroom and my hands are shaking and I'm nervous but thinking 'this is what you practise for'.
I kept telling myself, five good swings, see if you can hole a couple of putts and we'll see what happens. When I came out, I was in the best frame of mind I'd been in for a long time. Mentally I was seeing everything as it happened and I wasn't getting too far ahead.
Jonny: There was no discussion. If we acknowledge the position we're in, we're admitting we're nervous, so how is that going to help? We stick to our routine. We had 181 yards to the flag. An eight iron. We created a picture, just like we do on every shot.
Media playback is not supported on this device
Danny: I hit a lovely eight iron to about 10 feet.
Jonny: I walked off ahead as soon as he hit it. I'm pretty excitable and I didn't want him to see any emotion I'm giving off. Walking to the green there was no discussion. Everyone's telling Danny 'this is yours' but he probably didn't hear any of it. He was ridiculously focused.
Danny: We rolled in our birdie putt.
Jonny: The putt on 16 was all him. When he has a good line, why would he call me in? It only creates doubt.
Danny: Westy hit it to 35 feet and three-whacked, so all of a sudden we've opened a bit more of a gap. In the past 45 minutes, we'd gone from five behind to two in front. It was bonkers.
Jonny: On the 17th tee, I consciously said to Dan that these guys behind us are good and capable of making four birdies in a row.
Danny: I hit not a bad tee shot but was a bit hindered by a tree for the second and I hit eight iron long left. Looking back, I left myself a really tricky chip.
Jonny: I was thinking 'there's loads of green to work with' and it was a bog-standard chip shot. It got to the top of the hill and I thought 'he's not hit that hard enough' but it rolled over and then I thought 'that's quick' but it finished stiff and I thought that wasn't an easy chip shot!
Danny: I chipped it pretty much stone dead, which, round Augusta, you don't do. I'm going to go back this year and put a ball down and just see how difficult it is.
Danny: We'd hit a little cut driver off the 18th tee all week but we were pretty pumped with adrenaline and Jonny called three wood.
Jonny: My book said 296 yards to reach the bunker, so it's not hard to hit a good drive straight into it. He's got a low ball flight so he couldn't have done what Sandy Lyle did out of that bunker and reach the green.
Danny: He said: 'You can hit three wood as good as you like and you're never ever going to reach those bunkers.'
Jonny: Everyone was hustling to get a place to stand.
Danny: There was a lot of commotion. I stepped off the tee twice because people are moving up the sides, through the leaves, through the trees.
Jonny: That tee shot to me looks like hitting down a hotel corridor and I'm thinking it's getting narrower. Third time he's pulled the trigger.
Danny: I hit it 295 yards, straight down the middle of the fairway. Again, the hands were shaking, everything was shaking, but the walk up to the second shot was pretty enjoyable.
Jonny: There's a dip down before you walk up the hill to the green. As we got to the bottom, he took a massive deep breath. I knew he was nervous so I just said to him: 'You don't need to take that deep a breath, it's not that big a hill.'
Danny: I'd done 80% of the job I told myself I had to do - to make five good swings. One more to go. I think we had 183 yards, Jonny will still know. Can't miss the green left, can't miss it short, can't miss it long. I've seen it millions of times on the television, where it's impossible to get up and down from, and where you can give yourself a bit more margin. I pushed the seven iron a bit but it pitched on the collar of the green and worked off the bank back down exactly as I'd seen it before.
Jonny: The walk up to the green was an unbelievable experience. We were having a little giggle to ourselves, saying 'this is pretty cool'. I wish I'd taken it in more.
Danny: It was almost job done. We've got a 13-footer to get to six under, which I thought would be a difficult number for anyone to get to. But we get up on the green and look at the putt and you think it would be nice to get to six but I don't want to drop to four. So I cosied it down there and tapped in for par.
Jonny: The walk from the green to the clubhouse was bonkers. It was bizarre, surreal. It's stuff you watch on television and don't do yourself. We're walking off 18 and half-thinking we've won the Masters.
Danny: My father-in-law was at the back of the green, giving me a hug. You walk up to the cabin, sign your card [a bogey-free five-under-par 67], making sure you've got all that right and then it's a waiting game. We had 45, 50 minutes of waiting.
Jonny: I didn't know what to do with myself. I was half-watching, half-wondering if we should go the practice range in case there's a play-off.
Danny: We sat outside the recorders' hut and I'm trying to call [wife] Nic. The signal's not great, I'm just trying to get through to her. And I'm texting my mum and dad and brothers. But I'm constantly looking at the television to see what Jordan does.
Spieth birdies the par-five 15th to go three under with three to play.
Danny: You're going over all the scenarios where you can get beat. And then he made bogey on 17. He dropped back to two under and it's a physical impossibility to tie.
Jonny: I didn't realise the cameras were there and I just jumped on him.
Danny: I was on the phone to Nic, and Jonny jumped on me on the sofa. Everyone's seen that on the TV. That was the moment you realise that's what you've worked for and what you've just achieved. It isn't a dream. It's come true.
Danny: Every major trophy is significant in its own way but the Green Jacket is special. It's having your locker in the champions' locker room. It's your jacket being in there for the rest of your life. It's being able to go back to Augusta forever, until you don't want to play any more. The ceremony in Butler Cabin. You don't get to go inside the places I got to see at Augusta unless you win at Augusta. I'm honoured to be part of that now.
Jonny: We were whisked round the back of the clubhouse to Butler Cabin. That was cool. You've watched it on TV and then we're doing it. Dan's putting a Green Jacket on. I remember them fitting it because they've got them all lined up. Before he went in the room he looked across at me, just laughing. It was nuts. We've all had putts as juniors to win the Masters. I always dreamt about doing it but it was mega to be as close as I was to it and have some sort of contribution to Dan winning it.
Danny: When you walk through the door at home, you're not Masters champion any more. You're dad, or Dan. You're straight back to changing nappies and you take the jacket off so you don't get anything on it. The only time I've watched it back was that evening. I opened a beer and sat on the sofa with Nic. Watched it for an hour and a half. Highlights of what we'd done two days before. Just a crazy old few days really.

Article: The former private, who is in her 20s, has accepted a conditional caution for misconduct in a public office.
The woman has agreed to make a payment of Â£40 to an armed forces charity.
She was arrested at her Nottinghamshire home under the Metropolitan Police's Operation Elveden inquiry into alleged corrupt payments to public officials.
In a statement, the CPS outlined details of the offence but did not name the newspaper or the barracks.
CPS lawyer Gregor McGill said: ''The evidence in this case was considered very carefully and although there was sufficient evidence to prosecute this offence, when considering the public interest it was decided that a conditional caution was an appropriate course of action.
''In accepting a conditional caution, an individual accepts responsibility for the offending set out.''
The former soldier was arrested in September. She was the 87th person to be held as part of Operation Elveden, which was launched after the phone-hacking scandal at the News of the World newspaper.
The operation was established to investigate allegations of inappropriate payments to police but was widened in January 2012 to include other public officials. It is being overseen by the Independent Police Complaints Commission.

Article: The work shows that DNA and its chemical cousin RNA are not unique in their ability to encode information and to pass it on through heredity.
The work,  
          reported in Science
, is promising for future "synthetic biology" and biotechnology efforts.
It also hints at the idea that if life exists elsewhere, it could be bound by evolution but not by similar chemistry.
In fact, one reason to mimic the functions of DNA and RNA - which helps cells to manufacture proteins - is to determine how they came about at the dawn of life on Earth; many scientists believe that RNA arose first but was preceded by a simpler molecule that performed the same function.
However, it has remained unclear if any other molecule can participate in the same unzipping and copying processes that give DNA and RNA their ability to pass on the information they carry in the sequences of their nucleobases - the five chemical group "letters" from which the the two molecules' genetic information is composed.
The classic double-helix structure of DNA is like a twisted ladder, where the steps are made from paired nucleobases (RNA is typically a single helix).
Philipp Holliger of the UK Medical Research Council's Laboratory of Molecular Biology and a team of colleagues created six different DNA- and RNA-like molecules - xeno-nucleic acids, or XNAs - by replacing not the nucleobases but the sugar groups that make up the sides of the ladder.
"There's a lot of chemisty that seeks to build alternative nucleic acids, and people have been modifying the bases, the sugars and the backbone, but what we were focusing on was the type of nucleic acid or polymers that would retain the ability to communicate with the natural DNA," Dr Holliger explained in an interview for the Science podcast.
Because the nucleobases themselves were the same as those of DNA and RNA, the resulting molecules were able to join with their natural counterparts.
The effect is similar to work  
          recently published in Nature Chemistry
, showing that another sugar-substituted DNA analogue could be made to pair up with DNA itself.
But the crucial point in creating a full "synthetic genetics" is a set of nucleic acids like DNA and RNA that can not only carry genetic information, but would also allow it to be changed and passed on - evolution and heredity.
That requires a set of helper molecules called polymerases, which, once DNA or RNA "unzip" and expose their genetic information, help create new DNA molecules from those instructions.
Dr Holliger and his colleagues have developed polymerases that efficiently transcribe the code of their synthetic DNA to natural DNA and then from that back to another synthetic DNA.
The process of evolution was encouraged in the lab; one of their DNA analogues was designed to cling to a particular protein or RNA target, those that failed to do so were washed away.
As successive copies of those that stuck were made, variations in the genetic code - and the resulting structure the molecules took on - led to ever more tightly attached XNAs.
"We've been able to show that both heredity - information storage and propagation - and evolution, which are really two hallmarks of life, can be reproduced and implemented in alternative polymers other than DNA and RNA," Dr Holliger explained.
"There is nothing 'Goldilocks' about DNA and RNA - there is no overwhelming functional imperative for genetic systems or biology to be based on these two nucleic acids."
In  
          an accompanying article in Science
, Gerald Joyce of the Scripps Research Institute wrote that "the work heralds the era of synthetic genetics, with implications for exobiology (life elsewhere in the Universe), biotechnology, and understanding of life itself".
But the work does not yet represent a full synthetic genetics platform, he pointed out. For that, a self-replicating system that does not require the DNA intermediary must be developed.
With that in hand, "construction of genetic systems based on alternative chemical platforms may ultimately lead to the synthesis of novel forms of life".

Researchers have succeeded in mimicking the chemistry of life in synthetic versions of DNA and RNA molecules.

The care home, which is run by Lotus Senior Living Ltd, was given a score of one (unsatisfactory) for its quality of care and support; its quality of environment and its quality of staffing.
The home's quality of management and leadership received the second lowest score of two (weak).
Inspectors also noted that there had been "very little progress" following an earlier inspection which had already highlighted concerns.
A spokesman for the Care Inspectorate said: "We continue to have serious concerns about the quality of care being provided to residents at this service.
"Whilst we noted some improvement in some areas following a previous inspection, significant concerns remain over the service's performance in relation to ensuring the health and wellbeing of residents."
The spokesman said inspectors had "observed poor practice in relation to administering medication".
He added: "We have informed the service of the improvements which it must make to ensure that residents' needs are met and their rights respected.
"We will continue to work with them to ensure they improve, but unless we see evidence of significant improvement, we will not hesitate to take further action."
An unannounced inspection visit was carried out at Drumpellier Lodge, Coatbridge Road, Bargeddie, on 6 February.
The care home, which is run by Clancare Ltd, was given a score of two (weak) for its quality of care and support; its quality of management and leadership and its quality of staffing.Inspectors found that 10 requirements for improvement, made at a previous inspection, were not met.
A spokesman for the Care Inspectorate said: "We continue to have concerns about the quality of care and support being provided at this service and are working closely with them to ensure they meet the standards we expect.
"We have told the service the areas it must take urgent action on to improve.
"If we are not satisfied that improvement is being made we will not hesitate to take further action."

Article: She plays a no-nonsense character in House of Cards, and in real life Robin Wright is no different.
For four seasons, viewers have seen her in the role of Claire Underwood, the Machiavellian partner of stop-at-nothing politician, Frank Underwood, played by Kevin Spacey.
Both actors have also directed and produced episodes of the show. But while their roles are equally prominent, for years their salaries were not in parity.
"I was like, 'I want to be paid the same as Kevin.' It was a perfect paradigm and example to use, because there are very few films or TV shows where the maleâ€”the patriarch and the matriarch are equal. And they are in House of Cards," she told an audience at New York's Rockefeller Foundation.
Wright looked at statistics which showed that for some time, her character was more popular than Spacey's.
"So I capitalised on it. I was like, 'You better pay me or I'm going to go publicâ€¦and they did.'"
Wright's success at equalising her pay is a story to be noted, because it is still incredibly rare.
"She is playing a popular and important character in a series. She has leverage and she used it," says Lisa Maatz, vice president for government relations at the American Association of University Women (AAUW), which has conducted research into the broader issue.
"I admire her for standing up to them. Not everybody is going to be as fortunate. But her situation in terms of being underpaid is far too common."
US government statistics show that on average, women are paid less than their male counterparts, 79 cents for every dollar a man earns.
According to the White House, the median wage of a woman working full-time all year in America is about $39,600 (Â£27,116), 79% of a man's median earnings, which stand at $50,400.
The statistic is widely used to illustrate the discrepancy in pay across the sexes, and looks across all sectors.
In Fresno, California, Aileen Rizo took a similar stand against her employer after she learned she was receiving less pay than a new male employee, who didn't have a masters degree like she did.
Ms Rizo had been working as a maths consultant for four years for Fresno County Office of Education, when she found out that the new hire was being paid at the highest salary scale (a nine), while she was being paid at the lowest (a one).
When she confronted her human resources department about the difference, she was told it wasn't a mistake. "They said they'd used my prior pay as a guide, and that's why I was on less," she explained.
Ms Rizo began legal action against her employers in 2013, who argued they set wages based on the employee's most recent salary, plus a five percent increase. Experience wasn't a determining factor, they said.
Representatives for Fresno County pointed out that a woman working in the same department as Ms Rizo, was being paid more, and said that in the past 25 years more women had been on higher salary scales, than men in the same or similar position in the department.
The court ruled in Ms Rizo's favour, arguing that the fact another woman earned more than her, shouldn't diminish her right to a fair wage.  Her employers appealed the decision, and the case is still ongoing.
Since she began her lawsuit, Ms Rizo is now receiving the same pay as her male colleague, but she continues to fight for backdated wages. She also testified before the California legislature, which has since passed an Equal Pay Act in the state.
While she believes employers need to be more transparent and fair, she does also think women could also do more.
"We do need to get better at negotiating. I was trusting an organisation to act in a way of integrity. I took for granted that that's where everyone started."
"Whether you have to file a lawsuit or demand it and get it, women need to empower others and educate society about a problem that's still evident," she says.
But the scale of the problem is something which is widely debated.
Some critics say the "79 cents for every dollar" statistic is misleading, because it doesn't compare two people working in the same job, with the same background and qualifications. When those factors are taken into account, there still is a gender pay gap, but the percentage difference is much smaller, at around 7%.
"The idea that when a young woman graduates, the idea she's going to get paid 79 cents for every dollar a man makes, working in the same job, across our economy is a myth," argues Karin Agness, who is president of the Network of Enlightened Women, a conservative policy group.
Ms Agness believes that the 79 cents statistic gives young graduates a false impression of the workplace they're about to enter.
"It creates a victim mentality in women, and we don't want our young women going into the workforce thinking they are victims just because they are women," she says.
But Lisa Maatz from the AAUW says both measures are valid - one is more general, the other specifically compares similar roles - but both point to a discrepancy which needs to be addressed.
"The gender wage gap has many causes and contributors, including differences in education, experience, occupation and industry, and family responsibilities. But even after accounting for these factors, a gap still remains between men's earnings and women's earnings," argues a White House report on the issue.
Data on the pay gap for Hispanic and black women shows greater disparities. The gap between similar jobs fluctuates wildly based on the sector. And even controlling for similar jobs, the gap grows for women who are promoted into the director and executive level.
For Ms Maatz, there are other areas which also need to be addressed when it comes to wage disparity, for example the rise of so-called "pink collar" jobs, in which certain roles such as nurses, secretaries and teachers, are devalued simply because more women do them.
But Robin Wright's experience is a reminder that the gender pay gap affects women across all professions. She hopes her example will encourage other women to speak up.
"It's a male dominant workplace society. It always has been. And that's just the history.
"But it has to be unacceptable at this stage."

Article: Tour de France winner Wiggins became the most decorated Olympian in British history, with a total of seven medals.
He won the cycling time trial after Glover and Stanning rowed to victory in the women's pairs; all three were hailed by PM David Cameron.
GB's Michael Jamieson later took the silver in the men's 200m breaststroke.
Team GB kept the nation waiting until day five of the Games for the first home gold medals; however, there are high hopes for further podium finishes in Thursday's cycling.
After his victory, Wiggins, 32, cycled through cheering crowds gathered at Hampton Court, where he hugged his wife Catherine and his children Ben and Isabella.
Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday evening, Wiggins said that despite his success, he did not consider himself to be Britain's greatest ever Olympian.
He also said that, fresh from his victory in the Tour de France, he had been "greedy" and also intended to win Olympic gold. "I felt I could do both," he said, adding that the crowd support on his Olympic time trial ride was "incredible".
David Cameron described the successes in rowing and cycling as a "golden moment for Britain".
Mr Cameron said: "I think it's already a great Olympics, already a great start but this is really going to put rocket boosters on it for the whole country. I'm very, very excited."
Meanwhile, a BBC investigation has found illegal websites still offering tickets - which they have no right to sell - and which buyers may never receive.
Police have warned that such sites do not have access to tickets.
Det Supt Nick Downing, the head of the Olympic crime squad, said: "If they're an authorised site selling tickets, you've got to ask the question - where did they get their tickets from? How can they guarantee a supply? They can't."
In other developments:
Briton Chris Froome took the bronze medal in the time trial, which was watched along the route by an estimated 300,000 people.
Wiggins's grandmother Maureen Cousins was also at the side of the road as he crossed the finish line.
"I screamed when he won.  It is a combination of delight and relief... We all think he is the greatest," she said.
Earlier, Glover and Stanning made history by becoming the first British women to win an Olympic gold medal for rowing.
Mr Johnson said an "historic triumph will be celebrated throughout the country today".
"It's an outstanding achievement and I'm sure it will spur on all our athletes in the medal stakes. It's fantastic - Go Team GB," he added.
Glover, 26, a former PE teacher from Penzance, Cornwall, had been rowing for only four years before securing gold with Stanning, 27, a Royal Artillery captain, from Lossiemouth, Moray.
They stormed home in front of cheering crowds at Eton Dorney after leading from the start of the women's pair race.
After crossing the line they hugged each other and saluted the crowd, which included Princes William and Harry and the Princess Royal.
Speaking at the finish line, Glover's mother Rachel said her family was "absolutely delighted".
Stanning is likely to be deployed to Afghanistan next year.
Her commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Craig Palmer, said: "Soldiers from 32nd Regiment Royal Artillery were thrilled to watch the race from their bases in Afghanistan, while their friends and families watched it here in the UK.
"I am sure that they have been inspired by her performance and we look forward to welcoming her back to the regiment later this year."
Lt Col Palmer spoke to Stanning on the BBC News Channel, telling her she had "done a very special thing".
"We're looking forward to a very big party when you do come back to the regiment," he told Stanning.
Labour leader Ed Miliband praised the athletes as "fantastic" and said the games were going "beyond" expectations.

Tata is making 1,050 people redundant, including 750 at its Port Talbot site.
Community organiser Rob Edwards said he was surprised by Mr Koehler's departure and what it meant for the future.
"I think it compounds the recent news about the redundancies. You start to ask questions about long-term investments," said Mr Edwards.
"There is an element of doubt, we walk a path of uncertainty," he told BBC Radio Wales's Wales at Work programme.
He added that he wasn't concerned about the short-term commitments made by the company as it tries to save Â£300m as part of its current survival plan.
He said the union was worried that the move weakened the voice of the European operation when it came to decisions being made by the board in future.
Workers from Tata marched through Brussels with Mr Koehler and steelworkers from across Europe demanding that the EU take action on the price of Chinese imports.

Article: The plans for the development on the Hatchfield Farm estate in Newmarket, Suffolk, had been approved by Forest Heath District Council.
But last year Local Government Secretary Sajiv Javid refused to accept the decision.
Planning judge Mr Justice Gilbart ruled that Mr Javid's decision was fatally inconsistent and "plainly deficient".
The case will now have to be reconsidered.
Mr Justice Gilbart, sitting in London, quashed the refusal, saying: "The secretary of state has performed a complete and unexplained volte-face in his assessment of the highways impacts of two proposals for development on the same site in Newmarket and has also failed to apply his own National Planning Policy Framework."
The judge said: "There is on any view a requirement for more land for housing and other economic development in the Forest Heath District."
Edward Stanley, the 19th Earl of Derby, brought the legal challenge with Moulton Parish Council and the Rural Parishes Alliance.
The judge said local parish councils had for some time argued that growth in the area should not be dispersed among the rural parishes but concentrated in Newmarket.
Newmarket Horsemen's Group and some others were concerned that development in the town "may have an adverse effect on the horseracing industry that is based there" and lead to increased traffic.
A spokesman for Lord Derby said: "The secretary of state now has a second chance to determine the application. He should take full account of the significant benefits the planning application will bring to Newmarket when making a decision."
The Department for Communities and Local Government said: "We have received this judgment and will now consider our response."

Council leader Dave Stewart said the crossing at Cowes would be free until 2 July "in recognition of the problems" and to allow feedback.
Mr Stewart said the council had ordered a review of the project by auditors.
He said it had been a "frustrating and disappointing start" to the ferry.
Since launching late on 14 May the chain ferry has broken down, run aground and been suspended by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency due to "training issues".

Article: The lowest is Knowsley which could fall to zero as the last school teaching A-levels is closing its sixth form.
In a further seven authorities there are less than 20% of students taking A-levels in schools in their boroughs.
Nick Timothy of New Schools Network, which carried out the research, said it was a "glass ceiling" on ambition.
But a Department for Education spokeswoman said the figures were "misleading", because pupils could be studying A-levels in schools in other local authorities.
The analysis shows the wide differences in the numbers of young people taking A-levels in state schools and colleges in their council areas and getting qualifications that would help them apply for university places.
Source: New Schools Network
In 27 authorities, fewer than a quarter of pupils in this age group are taking A-levels in their council area.
In contrast, Harrow has 74% of pupils studying for A-levels in schools in the borough, and it's 71% in Darlington.
Teenagers might be travelling to take A-levels in schools and colleges in neighbouring local authorities.
But the study found that the authorities neighbouring these areas of low A-level take up were themselves likely to have below-average provision, so that students would have to compete for limited numbers of places.
The study warns of a "deep-seated problem" in ensuring that young people in poorer areas are able to take A-levels, saying that "access to A-levels is closely linked to deprivation" - with consequences for higher education and jobs.
But it shows that there is nothing inevitable about poorer areas being linked to low A-level take up and lower levels of university entry.
It highlights St Helens and the London boroughs of Lewisham and Islington as examples of authorities with both higher levels of deprivation and higher levels of young people taking A-levels.
Highest proportion of students taking A-levels
Source: New Schools Network
The analysis has been produced by the New Schools Network, which supports the opening of free schools, and it argues that these cold spots in A-level provision show the need for more schools serving this age group.
"Gaps in A-level provision are creating a glass ceiling for the poorest pupils by limiting access to A-Levels - which still offer the best chance of access to higher education and good employment prospects," said the organisation's director, Nick Timothy.
Leon Riley, who will become head of New College Doncaster, says that it will support students who at present have to go elsewhere.
"Currently 1,200 students travel outside Doncaster to access post-16 education. This cannot be right: we want to make a difference by providing local young people with access to top quality post-16 education," he said.
The analysis by New Schools Network follows the decision by the last school in Knowsley to offer A-levels, Halewood Academy, to close its sixth form.
The authority, which already has the lowest rate of A-level students and one of the lowest university entry rates in the country, will have no one taking A-levels in schools in the borough from next year.
As an academy, Halewood can decide to stop teaching A-levels without the local authority having any powers of intervention.
Parents at the school had campaigned to keep the sixth form, but the academy said that it was not financially viable.
"This is letting down the children of this community. There are people who want to go to university, lots of kids who want to do well," parent Vanessa Pointon said about the closure plans.
Knowsley council says the loss of A-levels in the borough is "not a council decision".
The regional schools commissioner, appointed to oversee academies by the Department for Education, has so far not set out any response to the withdrawal of A-level provision in Knowsley.
The Department for Education has not commented on plans for A-levels in Knowsley, but a spokeswoman rejected the analysis by the New Schools Network.
"These figures are completely misleading - they do not reflect those young people who study A-levels in a neighbouring borough, the actual levels of participation are far higher because many will choose to study in other areas.
"The primary reason the uptake of A-levels differs from area to area is because demand varies across the country. Where there is demand, provision is always available."

Article: In a Scrubbing Up column for the BBC News, Nigel Edwards, chief executive of the Nuffield Trust, says the hundreds of millions of pounds it will cost could be better spent elsewhere.
He said other areas for investment include improving out-of-hospital services and tackling sepsis.
But Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told the BBC doctors agreed with him.
His claims come despite criticism from the British Medical Association, which has argued he has not given enough detail about the plans or explained how it will be funded.
The BMA has been given until next Friday to agree to discuss the plans with the government.
Plans for a seven-day NHS have provoked a bitter row between the government and doctors' representatives.
Ministers argue thousands of people die every year because there is not the same level of service at weekends as during the week.
The British Medical Association, which represents doctors, says the government has failed to set out what its policy means in practice, and what it will cost.
It points out that many doctors already work at weekends.
In an exclusive interview and article for the BBC's "Scrubbing Up" column, the Nuffield Trusts's chief executive, Nigel Edwards, says a seven-day NHS is a good aspiration.
But he argues the health service is in a world of "tough trade-offs", with many hospitals only managing to meet their current commitments by running up deficits.
He concludes the policy is likely to cost hundreds of millions of pounds, and suggests - in the current climate - there are better ways of spending the money.
In his column, he says: "NHS policy is largely made by middle-aged, middle-class men and women who commute long distances into London and Leeds."
Mr Edwards added: "I think one compelling priority would be to try and shorten the time that patients stay in hospital.
"A seven-day-service helps a little with that but actually this is more about investing in community services and getting the decision-processes in hospitals a lot slicker. And we could do that, probably, more easily".
He says there may also be benefits from focusing on individual conditions.
"Another area would be sepsis, which has a very large toll of mortality, probably much more significant than seems to be associated with seven-day working.
"Putting in some measures to spot that early and to intervene in a more effective way would have a big effect on people."
Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has defended the push for a seven-day NHS. He acknowledged there may be "upfront costs" of hundreds of millions of pounds, but he told the BBC there may also be similar levels of savings because of improved discharge from hospital.
He also argued the government was investing in other areas such as the new meningitis B vaccine, new cancer drugs and dementia.
And he insisted there was strong support in the health service for the seven-day plan.
"For doctors who are totally passionate that the NHS should offer the best and safest care anywhere in the world, the knowledge that thousands of people die every year because we don't offer the same level of service at weekend as we do in the weeks is something that really worries them."
The chief executive of the Sepsis Trust, Dr Ron Daniels, welcomed the proposed emphasis on tackling the problem, which kills an estimated 37,000 people every year in the UK.
"Reducing deaths from sepsis is not rocket science but there's been relatively little investment in dealing with the problem.
"A stronger approach to tackling sepsis would be the quickest win towards saving lives and would require much less investment than a move to full seven-day services in the NHS."

Article: Researchers have found a 90% fall in levels of the human papilloma virus (HPV) in Scottish women since the vaccine was made available in 2008.
HPV virus types are thought to account for about 90% of cervical cancers.
Scientists hope the drop in HPV cases will lead to a significant drop in future cervical cancer cases.
The researchers, led by senior epidemiologist Dr Kevin Pollock at Health Protection Scotland, said they hoped to see a decrease in new diagnoses within a year.
He told BBC Radio Scotland: "The two HPV types we were vaccinating against - HPV 16 and HPV 18 - cause about 70% to 80% of cervical cancers within Scotland but the vaccine has exceeded our expectations because it appears to have knocked out another three high-risk HPV types which cause about 10% of cervical cancers.
"So we do forecast within the next few years a 90% reduction in cervical cancer within Scotland."
Researchers compared the cervical screening and vaccination records of women born in 1995, who had been vaccinated as teenagers, with those from unvaccinated women born between 1989 and 1990.
They found just 0.5% of women from the 1995 group tested positive for the virus, compared with 21.4% of women born before 1990.
The study also showed evidence that the vaccine protected against three other high-risk HPV genotypes involved in the development of cervical cancer.
The research will be presented to the Microbiology Society's annual conference in Edinburgh on Wednesday by Dr Kate Cuschieri, director of the Scottish HPV Reference Lab.
She said: "These new findings indicate that the positive impact of the HPV vaccine may be even greater than we initially thought.
"Collectively, these data demonstrate the significant and continued benefits of the HPV vaccination programme in Scotland, which has achieved a consistent and high uptake of around 90% in 12 to 13-year-old girls."
Dr Pollock added: "The very high uptake of the HPV vaccine is strongly associated with these massive reductions in high-risk HPV types that are known to cause approximately 90% of cervical cancer in Scottish women."
He said the virus was also known to cause a number of other cancers, including vulvovaginal, anal and a subset of head and neck cancers.
"These results suggest that this vaccine will also have a significant impact on these cancers in the years ahead", he said.
The research, which was funded by the Scottish government, looked at samples from more than 20,000 women, making it one of the largest population-based studies on the impact of the vaccine.
There were 388 new cases of cervical cancer in Scotland in 2014.

The Newtownards man became the first Irish cyclist to win a world track title in 117 years when he triumphed in the scratch race in Belarus.
Irvine, 28, also won silver in the points race at the World Championships plus a World Cup gold in Manchester and a European bronze this year.
"This is a tremendous honour," said seven-times Irish champion Irvine.
"I want to thank BBC Northern Ireland for this award as it is fantastic recognition for everything that has happened in the past year and also for the sport of cycling which has been going through somewhat of resurgence in popularity recently.
"I'm really looking forward to the next year with the Commonwealth Games, the World Championships and hopefully the Giro d'Italia.
"With any luck I will be chatting to some of the guys from BBC Sport NI from a podium sometime next year!"
After winning his historic world gold and silver in Belarus during February, Irvine then suffered a fractured hip at a road race event in Taiwan a month later which ruled him out until August.
However, the battling Irvine regained his fitness to win bronze at the European Track Championships in Netherlands before taking victory in the World Cup points event in Manchester two weeks later.
The judging panel of Northern Ireland sports journalists chose Irvine ahead of runner-up AP McCoy and motorcyclist Michael Dunlop.
Others shortlisted for the award were boxer Carl Frampton, Ireland cricket captain William Porterfield and triathlon star Aileen Reid.
The panel of judges comprised of Shane Glynn, editor Sport BBC NI, BBC NI sports reporter Nikki Gregg, Belfast Telegraph sports editor Stephen Beacom, Kenny Archer of the Irish News, News Letter sports editor Richard Mulligan and author and freelance journalist Orla Bannon.
"Once again the judging panel had a tough decision to make this year but we felt that Martyn's achievements were just outstanding," said BBC NI sports editor Glynn.
"I'm delighted that he's been voted BBC Northern Ireland's Sports Personality of the Year for 2013.
"To become a world champion, literally within an hour of winning a silver medal in another discipline, is nothing short of phenomenal.
"And to beat the likes of AP McCoy and Michael Dunlop to this award speaks volumes about Martyn's achievements."

Article: However, that's at the heart of the media's frustration.
The fact is the campaign has become a succession of tightly controlled photo opportunities... by all the main parties.
This has become the hi-vis, hard hat election.
It's been the predictable campaign gear for both David Cameron and George Osborne.
No walkabouts. No risk of a verbal ambush by ordinary voters.
But there's a fascinating side to this election where the campaign can offer raw politics, unplugged... where the voters engage with the politicians seeking their support.
Election hustings have been one of the big successes of this general election.
Magazine Monitor: Where did the word 'hustings' come from?
There have been a record number of them held in churches, according to research by one Christian charity.
I've been to a number of hustings so far and there's one reason why they work. The debates and exchanges are close up and often personal.
Voters are able to question the politicians and get beyond some of the campaign sound bites and slogans.
They also often highlight issues that are just overlooked in the "noise" of national campaigning.
That was the case at a hustings at the All Nations for Christ church in the Normanton area of the Derby South constituency, where the audience were mostly from the city's African Caribbean communities.
On the platform, representatives from all the parties, including Dame Margaret Beckett, who's defending a 6,000 Labour majority in Derby South.
There were questions from the audience on immigration, Europe and schools.
But one question particularly gripped the audience: Why were graduates from the African Caribbean communities three times more likely to be out of a job, six months after leaving university?
The study was carried out by the Bow Group think-tank and Elevation Networks, a youth employment charity, and was based on interviews with 2,500 students over two years.
It also found that black students were not being given the same opportunities as white students.
One angry voice in the audience shouted: "That's outrageous and disgraceful".
It got backing from the Greens.
"That indicates there's some form of discrimination going on in the jobs market," said John Devine, the Green Party candidate for Derbyshire's Amber Valley.
There was a suggestion from one questioner for employers to be forced by law to audit who and where they recruit staff.
A precise solution perhaps required a precise response.
But the Conservatives' Derby South candidate Evonne Williams tiptoed round this one.
"It's something that we haven't considered but I'm happy to take it back to the party," she told the questioner.
And Labour's Dame Margaret?
"We're going to be looking at the Equalities Act to see if it needs modernising and updating. So your suggestion is exactly the kind of idea we will be looking at," she said.
One platform speaker wanted to go much further. Lucy Care, the Lib Dem's candidate for Derby North, suggested that all job application forms should no longer include the person's name.
"We would like to have name blank application forms," she said.
"So all you read is their experience and what they've done. Often the name of the applicant can deter some employers from short listing or recruiting."
As for UKIP's Derby South hopeful Victor Webb, he didn't completely rule out having such a recruitment audit, but: "I wouldn't do this because of the burden of cost and regulation on small businesses."
For this hustings audience, maybe no instant solutions but they got the politicians thinking about their concerns.
"The key is getting people engaged," said Marc Grant, the event organiser.
"It's the first time we've held a hustings at the church."
"We wanted to show why politics is so important to our daily lives and I'm really pleased so many  people came along."
Whatever the outcome of this election, the locally organised hustings have emerged as a big campaign winner.

Article: A major emergency had been declared at the airport after the Italian C-27J aircraft lost communication.
It was escorted to Prestwick by RAF Typhoons as a precaution and landed without incident shortly before 20:00.
Police Scotland said the C-27J had been flying from Iceland to Italy.
Flights are believed to have been delayed for a short time at Glasgow and Edinburgh, but Scottish airspace was not closed.
Prestwick Airport also remained open throughout, and a Ryanair passenger flight to Malta took off a short time after the Italian plane landed.
A video posted on Facebook by the Ayrshire News newspaper appeared to show the civilian aircraft landing at the airport. The Typhoons did not land.
Photographs from the scene posted on social media showed several emergency service vehicles which had been summoned to the scene as a precaution.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said: "Typhoon aircraft were launched this evening from RAF Lossiemouth to intercept a civilian aircraft which was causing concern to air traffic control authorities.
"The aircraft was safely escorted to Prestwick airport and the local police now have the lead."

Article: Bomb disposal officers were sent to Birmingham's Lee Bank area on Friday and nearby roads were closed and cordoned off.
The men, two aged 32 and 37 were arrested in Stoke-on-Trent and three others, aged 18, 24 and 28, were arrested in Birmingham.
Magistrates granted police a further seven days to question the men.
Detectives from the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit appeared before London's Westminster Magistrates' Court via video link on Saturday to submit their request for a warrant of further detention, a spokesman said.
The men were arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism.
Ch Supt Sue Southern, from West Midlands Police, said: "The arrests of the five men were intelligence led and our investigation continues at full pace."
A number of properties in the Stoke and Birmingham areas have been searched as part of the investigation.
The BBC understands the force was dealing with two suspect devices that were found at a business in Lee Bank on Friday.

Article: Katy Bethel, 28, and Aaron Harris, 33, were arrested on 4 July 2015 at Coquelles' Eurotunnel check-in.
The couple were returning from Calais to Folkestone when they were stopped by customs officers after a four-hour trip to France.
Both were charged with aiding and abetting unlawful immigration.
Harris had previously pleaded guilty to the charge.
Ms Bethel, of Dial Road, Gillingham in Kent, appearing at Maidstone Crown Court, denies the charge.
Ms Bethel was six months pregnant with her fourth child when the Mercedes van she was in was stopped for border checks, the jury was told on Thursday.
When Harris was asked to open the van doors a police officer glimpsed a person's legs, and discovered 12 people concealed amongst tyres in the back of the van.
Ms Bethel told the court she had "no idea" the people were in there.
The prosecution questioned why she had previously stated they were going to buy alcohol and cigarettes for a party, but did not return with any purchases on what was a very short day out.
In the four hours the pair were in France, they sent and received 67 messages and voicemails to and from unknown numbers, the court heard.
Ms Bethel said Harris was using her phone on the trip to make calls and texts and she was unaware of their content.
She and Harris, the father of two of her children, were loaned the van from a friend of Harris' for a last minute day trip, the court was told.
They got lost while looking for a beach so instead left the van on a roadside to take an hour-long walk to a strawberry field near Calais, she said.
The prosecution accused Miss Bethel of talking "nonsense".
The case continues.

The tournament kicks off with France playing Romania on Friday, 10 June and the final will take place at the Stade de France in Paris on 10 July. Spain are hoping to retain the title they won in 2008 and 2012.
England will be appearing at their ninth finals, while Wales and Northern Ireland have qualified for the first time.
Good question - because, for the first time, there are 24 teams competing in the finals. That is an increase from the 16 that had taken part in every edition since it was hosted in England in 1996.
With six groups of four teams, it means the top two will qualify for the last 16, plus the four best third-placed finishers. In other words, only eight teams will fail to qualify from the group stage.
One point could be enough to put your team into the last 16 - and from then the tournament goes to a knockout format.
As Greece proved by pulling off a sensational triumph at Euro 2004, trying to predict a winner is a difficult game.
World champions Germany are understandably one of the favourites, while holders Spain are also short odds with the bookmakers.
Germany finished top of their qualification group but booking their place in France was not without its hiccups - with defeats by Poland and the Republic of Ireland. They have been beaten by France and England since qualifying but remain one to watch.
Spain dominated international football between 2008 and 2012 but failed to qualify from their group at the 2014 World Cup. Could this be a last hurrah for Vicente del Bosque's ageing but brilliant side?
France won the World Cup as hosts in 1998 - can they repeat the famous success of the team led by Didier Deschamps, Zinedine Zidane and Laurent Blanc?
A run into the latter stages by Les Bleus is likely to help restore national morale in a country still recovering from last year's deadly Paris attacks.
France are the bookmakers' favourites to win the whole thing, but their form is tricky to gauge because they did not have to qualify for this tournament.
Fast on the counter and unified after years of internal division, watch out for talented midfielders Paul Pogba and Blaise Matuidi.
But they cannot call upon prolific Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema. The French Football Federation (FFF) said he would not be picked after being investigated for his part in an alleged plot to blackmail Les Bleus team-mate Mathieu Valbuena, who did not make the squad.
Well, there are three of them in France - only Scotland missed out - plus the Republic of Ireland. It is going to get crowded too, because England and Wales are both in Group B, along with Russia and debutants Slovakia.
Don't expect much work to get done when England and Wales play each other - that match in Lens will be shown live on BBC One, kick-off 14:00 BST, on Thursday, 16 June.
Roy Hodgson's England have a good young team but doubts persist about their defence. They breezed through their qualifying group with a perfect record of 10 wins, while confidence was further boosted with March's impressive win away at world champions Germany.
Wales have got Real Madrid star Gareth Bale and plenty of heart. Chris Coleman's side reached their first major tournament in 57 years after losing just once in qualification.
Northern Ireland might have numerous players from England's lower leagues but they finished top of their qualifying group, losing just one of their 10 matches.
Striker Kyle Lafferty could not get a game for club side Norwich during qualifying (he has since been loaned to Birmingham) but he scored seven crucial goals in nine games for his country.
With the 24-team format offering hope to traditionally less-successful nations, five countries have taken advantage to secure their European Championship finals debut.
Northern Ireland and Wales, of course, are two of them.
Slovakia, who have been drawn alongside England and Wales in Group B, have qualified for the first time as an independent state. A 1-0 win against Spain showed the 2010 World Cup qualifiers can mix it with Europe's elite. Beware England and Wales.
Albania have never been near a major finals, but edged out Denmark - the 1992 champions - in their qualifying group thanks to a shock win in Portugal. Oh, and because they were awarded a 3-0 win in Serbia by the Court of Arbitration for Sport after a riot.
With a population of roughly 330,000 (comparable to Coventry) and only 21,508 registered players, Iceland are unsurprisingly the smallest nation to ever qualify for the finals.
How did they do that? By beating the Netherlands - 1988 winners and three-time semi-finalists - home and away during qualifying. The Dutch, for the first time since 1984, will not be there.
Real Madrid superstar Cristiano Ronaldo, who was voted the world's second best player behind Argentina's Lionel Messi in the 2015 Ballon d'Or vote, heads a star-studded cast.
Ronaldo will be leading Portugal's challenge, while Wales hope his club-mate Gareth Bale - the world's most expensive player - can transform his impressive La Liga form onto the international stage.
World Cup winners Germany boast a host of stellar names who have impressed in previous tournaments, most notably Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer and forward Thomas Muller plus Real Madrid midfielder Toni Kroos.
France's challenge is set to be driven by energetic Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba, who is still reportedly courting the attention of several English Premier League sides.
Belgium are not short of star quality either. Premier League pair Eden Hazard and Kevin de Bruyne will spearhead their quest for a first major tournament win, but the Red Devils are without injured captain Vincent Kompany.
And Sweden superstar Zlatan Ibrahimovic, 34, will be hoping to illuminate an international tournament for what could be the final time.
The Netherlands' failure to qualify leaves Bayern Munich winger Arjen Robben watching from home, while his club-mate Franck Ribery was not named in the France squad, despite suggestions he was considering ending his international retirement.
The tournament's 51 games will be staged at 10 locations across France, including new stadiums in Bordeaux, Lille, Lyon and Nice.
The opening match - between France and Romania on 10 June - and the 10 July final will be played at the Stade de France in Paris.
Building the new venues and renovating historic grounds such as Marseille's Stade Velodrome has cost 1.6bn euros (£1.2bn) - modernisation which was necessary, organisers say, because France did not fully capitalise on hosting the 1998 World Cup.

In March this year, the International Football Association Board (IFAB) ratified a host of revisions to the laws of the game in an attempt to remove inconsistencies and meet the needs of the modern game. The changes came into effect on 1 June, so will apply for Euro 2016.
More than 90 revisions were made, but these are some of the key changes:
Kick-off: Previously, the ball had to go forward from kick-off but the rule has been changed to allow it to go in any direction.
Pre-match red cards: Players can now be sent off before a match gets under way, although they can be replaced by another player in the match-day squad.
Leaving the pitch after treatment: If a player is injured in a challenge resulting in a yellow or red card, they no longer have to leave the field and can have a quick assessment or medical treatment. This change is designed to prevent situations where a team would be temporarily down to 10 players.
The end of 'triple punishment': A professional foul inside the area will now normally result in a yellow card for the offender, and not a red. This is to end the so-called triple punishment of penalty, dismissal and suspension, which was seen by some as excessive. There are exceptions for when the offender will receive a red which include holding, pushing or pulling and violent conduct.
Goalline technology, already established in the Premier League and elsewhere, will be used at Euro 2016.
Yes. But you had better be quick. Most of the group games - including all of England's matches - are sold out.
However, as of 9 June there are tickets available to watch Wales and Northern Ireland, plus other games involving some of the smaller nations. There are also tickets available for the opening game between France and Romania - at 395 euros each.

Each of the 10 host cities will have official Uefa fan zones. The fan zones will have a giant screen for showing all of the matches throughout the tournament.
The biggest will be in Paris, where up to 90,000 supporters can gather on the Champ de Mars - in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower.
You won't miss a kick.
The BBC and ITV will bring audiences closer to the heart of the action than ever before with extensive coverage of Euro 2016.
The BBC will showcase 26 live matches on TV and streamed online within its 140 hours of programming, including highlights on BBC One, BBC Two and the Red Button plus 24 days of coverage on Radio 5 live.
The BBC's Euro 2016 digital service will feature live broadcasts of all BBC games, commentary and live text coverage of every game featuring in-game highlight clips, on-demand highlights of every goal, breaking news, exclusive features and expert analysis.
ITV will be home to 26 live games across ITV1 and ITV4, which will be simulcast live on the ITV Hub.

The French government has extended a state of emergency imposed after the Paris attacks in November to cover Euro 2016.
The coordinated gun and bomb attacks in Paris on 13 November killed 130 people and were claimed by so-called Islamic State.
The Stade de France, which was targeted by suicide bombers, will host the opening match of Euro 2016 and the final.
The current state of emergency gives police extra powers to conduct searches and put people under house arrest.
More than 90,000 police, soldiers and private security agents are being deployed as well.

Article: Under the adverse conditions, RBS's capital levels fell by 7.5 percentage points - the third biggest fall of the 51 banks tested.
However, RBS said the tests showed it had made "continued progress".
RBS was bailed out by the government in 2008 and the UK taxpayer continues to hold a 73% stake in the bank.
The health check of 51 lenders in the eurozone and the rest of the EU, including the UK, was carried out by the London-based European Banking Authority.
It examined the impact of GDP falling by about 7% between now and 2018.
Why are the banks being tested?
The Bank of England said the results for RBS and three other UK banks - Barclays, HSBC and Lloyds - were "consistent with those of previous Bank of England stress tests".
"They provide evidence that major UK banks have the resilience necessary to maintain lending to the real economy, even in a macroeconomic stress scenario," it added.
Under the test conditions, RBS was left with a capital buffer of just over 8%.
Ewen Stevenson, RBS chief financial officer, said: "The EBA stress test results demonstrate our continued progress towards transforming the balance sheet to being safe and sustainable.
"We are confident that in delivering our strategy, we will transform RBS into a low-risk, resilient bank."
Conservative former chancellor Lord Lamont urged people not to be overly concerned about RBS's position, saying it was still "well above the minimum capital" that would be required - and saying the real danger to the European economy came from continental institutions.
He told BBC's Today programme there was "work to be done" but attention should be focused on banks in Germany and Italy, as well as Portugal and Greece which were not tested because they were considered too small.
"That is where it is thought there is a lot of weakness in the European banking system," he said, warning the situation in Italy and other countries "could create a real political crisis" for Europe.
Under the test conditions, Barclays' capital buffers would fall by 4 percentage points in the event of a major economic shock, leaving it with a buffer of 7.3%.
Unlike in previous years, the EBA did not judge whether banks had passed or failed its latest tests.
In 2014, if banks had a capital buffer of 5.5% after the stress test, then they were considered healthy, and analysts use that as an informal benchmark.
Both RBS and Barclays surpassed that mark in the latest test.
Allied Irish Banks, which was bailed out by Irish taxpayers, showed a near 9 percentage points fall in capital levels in the test.
"AIB is well-capitalised and capital accretive," the bank said in a statement.
"The results published today are point-in-time projections based on prescribed stress assumptions and should not be treated as indicative of the future financial performance."
Italy's Monte dei Paschi di Siena was by far the worst performer, with the test forecasting that its capital would fall by 14 percentage points under the adverse conditions.
Shortly before the results of the stress test were released, Monte dei Paschi di Siena announced that it had secured the backing of a consortium of banks for a rescue plan.
The plan involves the sale of €9.2bn (£7.7bn) of bad loans and an injection of €5bn of fresh capital.
Founded in 1472, Monte dei Paschi is one of the world's oldest banks, but in recent years has been one of Europe's weakest, with €50bn of bad loans.
Analysts were also keen to see how German banks performed under the test conditions.
Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank were left with capital buffers of less than 8% at the end of the test.
"Commerzbank is robust and stress resistant," Commerzbank chief risk officer Marcus Chromik said in a statement.
"Even under the adverse conditions of the EBA stress scenario, the stability of the Bank would be guaranteed."
After the financial crisis of 2008, US banks took hefty charges to clean up their balance sheets, but European banks were much less aggressive, leaving them with billions of euros of poorly-performing loans.
"Whilst we recognise the extensive capital raising done so far, this is not a clean bill of health," EBA Chairman Andrea Enria said in a statement.
"There remains work to do."

RBS Group performed comparatively poorly in the latest European stress tests, which assess how the banks might perform in adverse economic conditions.

The two teams faced off in Patras, Greece, earlier this month, with European title contenders Greece running out winners, 92-64.
Three members of that team will be missing at the Copper Box, however, offering GB a chance of revenge.
"I think it's going to be amazing - I'm from Stratford so I love playing there [at the Copper Box]," said GB guard Teddy Okereafor.
"This is the level we need to be playing at to make sure we're 100% ready for EuroBasket this year.
"We've got a couple of guys who are going to be playing for the first time in London so it's going to be exciting for them - I think the atmosphere's going to be great."
The game will be Britain's only home game before they compete at FIBA EuroBasket 2017, which starts at the beginning of September with a qualifying group in Istanbul, Turkey.
After they play Greece, coach Joe Prunty's team travel to a four-team tournament in Poland, their last warm-up games before EuroBasket starts.

Article: Jones, 31, suffered a shin injury while on international duty with Trinidad and Tobago on Tuesday.
Cardiff manager Russell Slade said there was no break and Jones will be assessed once he returns to Wales.
"We're hoping he will be in on Sunday," said Slade. "We don't know how long he'll be out for."
This is the second time in the space of two months Jones has been unavailable for Cardiff following international duty.
He missed the opening four games of the season after being deemed unfit following his involvement in the Gold Cup, held in America and Canada in July.
The latest set-back came in his country's goalless draw with Nicaragua in Port of Spain when he was carried off on a stretcher after 73 minutes.
"It's not broken, that's the most important thing, but there is a lot of swelling there. It will be assessed the moment he lands," said Slade.
Jones' injury ends a miserable week for Slade that also saw him lose defender Bruno Ecuele Manga for at least two months to a groin injury sustained while training with Gabon.
"As with Bruno, it's difficult to get the information you require," added Slade of Jones' condition.
Cardiff missed the striker's presence on Saturday in a dour stalemate with Preston.
Slade admitted his side were poor as they registered two efforts on target against a team that started the afternoon on the bottom of the Championship table.
"I didn't think we got going until 50 or 60 minutes into the game and that can't happen," he said.
"Clearly it's not something we designed or wanted. We set out exactly what we wanted to do but we didn't do that.
"It can happen away from home sometimes, but it's dangerous because when you come up against top opposition, they will punish you in those periods.
"We haven't served up too many halves like that so benefit of the doubt.
"We came out for the second half and looked like a team again that wanted to go on and win a football match."
Slade's mood on Saturday evening would not have been helped when one of his discarded strikers, Javi Guerra, put Rayo Vallecano in front against Barcelona in La Liga at the Nou Camp.
Guerra, 33, moved to Rayo on a season-long loan in August after being told he was not in Slade's plans.

Article: Wales paid a high price for failing to make their extra numbers count when the Wallabies were reduced to 13 men for seven minutes in the second half.
Fly-half Bernard Foley kicked all Australia's points, with Dan Bigger twice on target for Wales.
Australia now face Scotland in the quarter-final on 18 October, with Wales against South Africa the day before.
It was Wales' 11th consecutive defeat against the Australians, a run going back to 2008.
Wales coach Warren Gatland's men had their chances but were repelled by some extraordinary defence, with number eight Taulupe Faletau dropping the ball inches from the line and George North at centre held up over the line by Wallabies back-row Ben McCalman.
In the long run of narrow losses to Australia, this will rank among the most frustrating for Gatland.
There was a lack of composure in a 10-minute period around the hour mark, when Australia's battling 13 held firm.
And having seen off the barrage, the Wallabies eventually lifted the siege and were rewarded when Foley's fifth penalty gave his side a two-score cushion with eight minutes remaining.
Australia stated their intentions in the opening seconds when they opted to take a scrummage from the first penalty of the game deep in their own half.
They almost paid a high price when Gareth Davies sprinted away down the narrow side.
But Biggar's fourth-minute penalty was all Wales had to show for their early pressure.
Two unyielding defences battered anything that moved, with the breakdown a genuine contest and Wales successfully countering the Wallabies' driving maul.
However, as the half wore on and Australia's pack - and scrummage in particular - got on top, the penalty count mounted against the Welsh with Foley profiting.
The match was a slow burner but it burst into life at the start of the second half.
Australia drove the lineouts with more venom, but Wales took control after the Wallabies incurred the wrath of referee Craig Joubert.
Scrum-half Will Genia had a yellow card for failing to retire 10 metres as his opposite number Gareth Davies took a quick penalty and Genia was followed into the bin when second-row Dean Mumm infringed at a lineout.
However, Australia's defence while reduced to 13 was simply heroic.
Australia's seemingly easier path to a possible final - avoiding South Africa and New Zealand en route - is reward for a courageous and skilful rearguard action.
They will look forward to their battle with the Scots, while Wales face a resurgent Springbok side.
The nature of yet another defeat to Australia, however, will leave a bitter taste in the mouth.
Gareth Davies of Wales was a livewire for the whole of the game and won this accolade. But this was a match won by the defence of Australia.

Article: After thunderstorms ended play prematurely on Friday, Poulter completed the remaining four holes of his second round in one under.
That gave him a six-under round of 66 and a halfway total of 14-under-par.
Veteran Spaniard Miguel Angel Jimenez parred the four holes he had to finish, adding a 73 to his opening 63, to leave him in a six-way share of second place.
Poulter, who birdied five of the first 11 holes on Friday, tweeted that evening: "Now that was a close call. On 14th green when lightning struck very close by."
After three-putting the 12th to drop a shot, the world number 40, aided by a strengthening wind, reached the par-five 13th green in two shots to set up a simple birdie.
And on Saturday he birdied his first hole of the day, the 15th, to boost his chances of a first European Tour victory in two years.
The 38-year-old is now 33-under-par for his last six rounds at the Colin Montgomerie-designed Maxx Royal course.
"I played exactly the same last week but didn't hole my putts," said Poulter, who finished joint sixth in the WGC-HSBC Champions last Sunday, the tournament which provided his last win in 2012.
Ryder Cup player Victor Dubuisson, who won the inaugural tournament last year, was 13 shots off the pace and one over.
The Frenchman, who played with a persistent nose bleed in round two on Friday, birdied the last for a round of 68.
World number four Sergio Garcia, the highest ranked player in the field, is two over after recording triple bogey sevens at different holes in both of his opening rounds.
The tournament is the third event of the European Tour's Race to Dubai Final Series, which culminates with the World Tour Championship in Dubai from 20 to 23 November.

Article: Cotter will leave the Scotland job and be replaced by Glasgow boss Gregor Townsend at the end of the season.
Strauss, who will start at number eight against Ireland on Saturday, says the Scotland players want to send Cotter out on a high.
"When people move on you want to give them a good send off," Strauss said.
"It does bring that little bit more of an incentive. You do try that little bit harder. You need emotion to play rugby and it does give you that little extra edge."
Scotland have not won an opening day Six Nations fixture since the victory over France at Murrayfield in 2006. Their record against Ireland in the championship does not offer much cause for optimism either. Ireland have won 14 of 17 Six Nations matches between the sides.
Moreover, Joe Schmidt's side have beaten South Africa, Australia and New Zealand since last summer, with Munster's CJ Stander a stand-out performer, and a player with whom Strauss is well acquainted.
"We shared a room at the Springbok camp for a week back in the day," Strauss said.
"He's a farmer from up north in South Africa and I'm more of a beach boy from down in the city in Cape Town. We get along well and he's a very nice guy.
"He's a very tough player. Even with the Bulls, I played for the Lions so there was a very big rivalry between our two South African teams. He was always one of the guys we watched out for. He's come over and he's done exceptionally well."
Scotland resource coach Nathan Hines, who will follow Cotter to Montpellier in the summer, warned that Schmidt will have pinpointed every Scottish weakness ahead of the Murrayfield clash.
"He brings an unbelievable tactical awareness," said Hines, who played under Schmidt at Leinster.
"He goes through the other team with a fine-tooth comb and finds their weaknesses. That gives his teams confidence.
"I was across at the end of last year and spoke to him. The door is never closed with Joe, unless it is and he hasn't told me yet! He's an open guy and we had some good times with Leinster so I'm sure he'll give me a cheeky smile on Saturday before kick-off.
"They're very good at what they do. They find weaknesses and they exploit those weaknesses and make it very hard for you to play. It's about how we combat that and how we make it as difficult as possible for them to execute."
Ireland captain and hooker Rory Best expects to wage a punishing set-piece battle with Scotland's inexperienced front-row.
Edinburgh's Allan Dell, and Glasgow duo Fraser Brown and Zander Fagerson have just nine Test starts between them (three each), but 100-cap Best warns their lack of international appearances will not make for an easy ride.
"When you get that two-three link that play together every week, train together every day, it helps a lot," he said. "There's no doubt that will play into their hands.
"They're inexperienced if you look in terms of Test rugby as a combination but if you look at what they've achieved individually so far this season….to go to Welford Road and dominate the way Glasgow did and the way they've been performing, we've played against them provincially and it's a very tough task scrumming down against that Glasgow scrum.
"They form two-thirds of the front row on Saturday. We're under no illusions that it's going to be a tough ask. They're quality players."

Article: "Industrial-strength" extremists cannot be dealt with "just with force of arms", he said in a rare interview.
During the Iraq war, Mr Petraeus devised the strategy that saw a "surge" in US troop numbers and secured support from Sunni tribesmen against al-Qaeda.
Iraq's US-backed army is now battling to retake territory seized by IS.
Gen Petraeus described the group as "a formidable enemy".
"It is really a conventional army that also has elements of an insurgency, and indeed significant terrorist elements as well," he said.
But when asked to compare IS with its predecessor, al-Qaeda in Iraq - which Gen Petraeus was instrumental in defeating - he said the latter "had much greater roots in Iraq and much greater numbers than IS".
The retired general characterised the recent capture by IS of Ramadi, the capital of Anbar province, as "a strategic loss in the sense that the narrative of IS being on the defensive - of losing - was shown to be somewhat hollow".
"I do think Ramadi will be retaken in a matter of weeks or less," he added.
"But this was a big setback. At such a time, one has to look at the strategy, at refinements that need to be made, at efforts that need to be augmented, and I know that's what's going on right now."
1974: Graduates from West Point US military academy, joining the army
2007: Leads US troop surge during Iraq conflict
2008: Head of US Central Command
2010: Nato commander in Afghanistan
Mid-2011: Leaves military to become CIA director
November 2012: Resigns over affair
After commanding international troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, Gen Petraeus became head of the CIA but was forced to stand down in 2012, following revelations of an extra-marital affair.
Subsequent allegations that he provided classified information to his mistress while he was CIA director led him to plead guilty to one misdemeanour charge.
But despite the turbulence of his private life, Gen Petraeus remains one of the heroes of America's controversial military operations of recent years.
He was the architect of the "surge" in Iraq that deployed more US troops, but equally important, got them out of their defended compounds to create security at a local level.
He also greatly expanded the Anbar Awakening, the mobilisation of Sunni tribesmen to combat al-Qaeda.
Not surprisingly in the wake of the recent setbacks in Iraq, his views are being canvassed by the White House, the Pentagon, and on Capitol Hill.
The keynote of the Petraeus approach today is as it always was - the need for the political and military aspects of strategy to march closely in step.
"You cannot deal with an industrial-strength extremist problem just with force of arms," he said.  "You have to have that political component as well."
Political change has to start at the top. Above all, Gen Petraeus says, "the Sunni Arabs have to be given incentives to support the new Iraq rather than to oppose it".
As to the fundamental question - can the Iraqi military actually win against Islamic State? - he has few doubts.
"During the surge and in the years after the surge, Iraqi forces fought and died for their country at vastly higher numbers than did US and coalition forces. We know that they can fight," he insists.
"We know that they will fight. But they will only fight if they have good leadership, and the support and knowledge that somebody will have their back if they get into a tough fight."
That looks like requiring greater US involvement closer to the frontline. Gen Petraeus is reluctant to give details.
"Should there be US advisors with Iraqi forces below the divisional  level?" he asks. "Should there be joint teams of tactical air controllers on the ground with security and other assets to support them?
"Does there need to be an augmentation of the train-and-equip effort? Can we accelerate the delivery of some of the equipment that Iraq so desperately needs?"
It sounds like the elements of a blueprint for a re-invigorated US effort. But then again - typical Petraeus - there is the political dimension.
"Are we doing all that we can to empower and support those Iraqi leaders, starting with Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who recognise the need to bring the Sunni Arab population back into the fabric of Iraqi society? And, most importantly, are our military elements and structures sufficiently supporting the political component and vice versa?"
In response to my comment that all this could have been said a year ago - Gen Petraeus responded by saying that he did indeed say it all a year ago. This is not about re-inventing the wheel.
"We need to see the same elements of this (previous) comprehensive civil-military counter- insurgency campaign, albeit today with the Iraqis playing the key roles, enabled by the Americans."
Gen Petraeus acknowledges the difficulties of grappling with the horrors in Syria but insists that the only way forward is to train and equip moderate opposition elements. He says that more such fighters will spring up once the programme gets under way.
And he is very cautious about any Iranian role in combating IS. He insists Iran remains a revolutionary power in the region.
"This is a country that has made progress because of chaos. It has both benefited from chaos and fomented chaos to try to achieve regional hegemony," he says.
So he believes that "while there can indeed be some coincidence of interest between the US, its coalition allies in the region and Iran in terms of the defeat of IS (...) the over-arching context is one that gives you reason to have considerable caution in how you go forward in the relationship with Iran".
Gen Petraeus still travels to Iraq regularly. He knows the key players well. And though out of uniform and established in a civilian career as an adviser, he remains the man who did achieve a kind of success in Iraq.
That is a commodity that is in short supply today for the Americans and the Iraqi authorities. This  makes the Petraeus approach an attractive model.
But the question remains: Can the outcome be the same with the Iraqi military cast in the role of the Americans?

Article: GM will also hire 1,000 new workers in Ontario to focus on research for connected and driverless cars.
Canada and particularly Ontario has been promoting its car-making sector as it attempts to compete with Mexico.
Ontario's Premier called the investment a "vote of confidence".
"Our government welcomes this investment, which will help Ontario play a leading role in building the auto industry of the future," said Premier Kathleen Wynne.
Canada has been fighting to keep carmakers in the country. Many have been lured to Mexico where production is cheaper and the cars have the same tariff free access to the US market.
As part of this effort last year Ontario became the first Canadian province to allow road testing of driverless cars.
Over the last five years carmakers in Ontario produced nearly 15% of all North American vehicles.
The investment will be in GM's Kapuskasing plant, which focuses on cold weather technology.
In April, GM purchased land to develop an urban mobility campus to test driverless cars in city driving conditions.

Article: In articulating why the tournament needed a dramatic overhaul, Dodson spoke about "bleak prospects" and "perfect storms" if everything stayed the same. Browne went even further when pointing out a "potentially profound" risk to the professional game in Ireland if the Pro12 didn't get its act together.
It was all about money. The Pro12 brings in about £12m in television revenues - a relative spit in a bucket compared to the riches of the Premiership in England and the Top 14 in France.
The unions in Scotland, Ireland and Wales were all beside themselves with worry over the yawning financial disadvantage they were at compared to the English and the French as they attempted to keep hold of their marquee players.
In exploring the possibility of inviting two American franchises into the Pro12 in time for the 2018-19 season, Dodson spoke of the necessity to tap into new markets and find new money in order to fight off English and French clubs who may come looking for Scotland's finest. "To stay as we are is not an option," he said.
Things have changed. It's not the Americans who are in the frame now, it's the South Africans. And 2018-19 is not on the table anymore, it's 2017-18. It's the coming season, which begins in September.
On 7 July - this coming Friday - the South African Rugby Union will go through the Pro12's list of requirements for acceptance of two of their franchises - the Cheetahs from Bloemfontein and the Kings from Port Elizabeth - into the next Pro12 campaign.
They will have to make commitments on finance - each of the current 12 clubs from Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales could be in line for an extra £500,000-£800,000 in revenues from the South African union and South African television - as well as commitments on squad enhancement. The last thing the Pro12 needs is two more also-rans.
The Cheetahs and the Kings are the poor relations of South African rugby. Of the six SARU franchises in Super Rugby, they are the weakest. They sit in their usual perch at the tail-end of the southern hemisphere club competition, a combined eight wins from 27 games this season and six wins from 30 games last season. Of the 27 players used by the Springboks in their 3-0 series win over the French this month, only two came from the Cheetahs and none at all from the Kings.
Super Rugby is a failing competition, the expansion to 18 teams - to include sides from Japan and Argentina in addition to those from Australia, New Zealand and South Africa - has proved to be a calamity that now needs unravelling. The crowds are falling, the television audience is collapsing, there are too many teams in a bloated league format that is confusing and unloved.
Three teams will be culled at the end of the current season - the Cheetahs and the Kings are two of them. SARU could have killed off the pair of them or they could have rolled them into their four other franchises, but then the Pro12 option struck and now, according to sources close to the negotiations, this deal is 75% likely to happen in time for the coming season.
Already, behind the scenes, a provisional format for a new Pro14 is being put together. There are different scenarios but the most probable is that the 14 teams are split into two divisions of seven - two Irish, two Welsh, one Scottish, one Italian and one South African.
They'd play home and away - 12 games. All the regular local derbies would exist on top of that. Instead of two rounds of the 1872 Cup between Glasgow and Edinburgh there would be three. Play-offs would continue and fewer games would be played in international windows.
That's if SARU deliver the goods on Friday and everything goes smoothly thereafter. Don't discount a spanner in the works, but there is mounting confidence in this going through.
If it does, then the already rapid pace of change will go up another gear as the various unions attempt to sell this to their supporters, and their various commercial and logistical arms attempt to put plans in place. There's a fixture schedule to be organised, there are arrangements to be made over playing the South Africans in South Africa and having the South Africans playing in Europe.
The Pro12 already has too many uncompetitive teams and one of the pre-requisites of the deal would be that the decidedly underwhelming Cheetahs - who average just less than 8,000 fans per home game in a stadium that holds 48,000 - and the flops that are the Kings - who bring in just 7,000 per game in a ground that holds almost 49,000 - would be beefed-up by transplanted Springboks.
Quite how SARU are going to remove talents from the Stormers, the Bulls, the Sharks and the Lions without there being an uprising in Cape Town, Pretoria, Durban and Johannesburg is anybody's guess. That's what they will need to sign up to, though. There's potentially a mountainous in-tray and precious little time to get through it. If Friday happens the way Pro12 officials think it may, they'd have eight weeks until the new league is supposed to start.
There is a surreal air to all of this. Supporters of the Pro12 clubs haven't really engaged with this story yet, partly, one suspects, because the British and Irish Lions are preoccupying their thoughts and, partly again, because they probably think this is just a flyer, a silly season story for the summer, a bottle of smoke.
It's hard to get your head around. The wrong kind of expansionism - plans are still afoot to bring in an American franchise next summer - has brought Super Rugby to a dark place. Why follow them?
How can you shoe-horn in, at eye-watering speed, two disparate South African franchises and expect to be taken seriously as a league? How can supporters buy into a competition that looks like a dog's dinner? The Pro12 knows that in terms of PR they have an Everest to climb. In their slippers. Going backwards. In a blindfold.
There's also the bottom line that Dodson and Browne and others have spoken about. As it is, the Pro12 is not doing it for them as a commercial entity. To sit on their hands and do nothing but moan about their lack of cash and their vulnerability to rich owners in England and France achieves nothing.
The Pro12 needs a radical shake-up, it's true. This would be radical, no doubt about it. A year ago, Dodson and Browne said they wouldn't be hanging about, that the time for action was now. Usually you take that stuff with a pinch of salt. For some, as they digest this, it'll be a shot of brandy that'll be required.

It was back in August last year that Mark Dodson, chief executive of Scottish Rugby, and Philip Browne, his counterpart in the Irish Rugby Football Union, truly raised the alarm about the Pro12.

Article: A statement announced the formation of a joint operations room following what it said was an increase in attacks on residential areas and displaced people.
Rebels were said to have subsequently launched attacks in the province of Latakia and in neighbouring Hama.
Meanwhile, the Syrian opposition delegation in Geneva said it intended to suspend formal peace talks.
The cessation of hostilities brokered by the US and Russia to make way for the talks has resulted in a significant reduction in violence since it took effect on 27 February.
But escalating fighting in recent days, particularly around the divided northern city of Aleppo, has left it on the verge of collapse.
"After the increase of violations by regime forces that included targeting displaced people and continuous bombing of residential neighbourhoods, we declare the start of the battle in response," said the rebel statement issued on Monday morning.
The text was signed by the powerful Islamist groups Ahrar al-Sham and Jaysh al-Islam, as well as several groups that fight under the banner of the Free Syrian Army.
Later in the day, the Syrian opposition negotiating team, the High Negotiations Committee (HNC), said it "intended to postpone formal participation" in the peace talks, UN Special Envoy to Syria Staffan de Mistura said.
Ever since Syria's truce came into force in late February, there have been repeated violations. But these new attacks are the most significant yet - rebel forces are attacking key front lines, and there have been repeated air strikes by the Syrian military.
This upsurge in fighting is putting new pressure on fragile peace talks. Opposition delegates are now discussing if the time has come to leave Geneva - they are reported to have received a letter from rebel forces on the ground, urging them to exert more pressure on the UN envoy Staffan de Mistura who has been mediating in these indirect negotiations between the warring sides.
The opposition is now accusing the UN of bias after Mr de Mistura floated a proposal to allow Syria's President Assad  to remain in office, in a ceremonial role.
I've heard that idea in recent months from Russian and Iranian sources. But Syrian opposition groups have flatly rejected it - their Western backers are urging them not to walk out but it is becoming increasingly clear that these talks are not going anywhere.
The HNC wanted to express its disappointment at the deterioration in the humanitarian situation and in the cessation of hostilities, Mr de Mistura said.
But the envoy added that the HNC would remain in Geneva and informal discussions with the two sides would continue with a view to "taking stock" on Friday.
The US on Monday called on Russia to use its influence on the Syrian government to stop attacks that threatened the seven-week cessation of hostilities as well as the Geneva peace talks, a State Department official said.
Separately, President Barack Obama and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin held an "intense conversation" on Monday that covered Syria, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said.
Meanwhile, four Syrians including three children in the Turkish town of Kilis were killed in rocket fire from Syrian territory controlled by co-called Islamic State (IS), the local governor's office said.
The Turkish military fired artillery in response, Hurriyet newspaper reported.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that rebels had launched an assault on the positions of government forces and their allies in Latakia's northern countryside early on Monday and by midday had made advances.
The UK-based monitoring group also said rebels were close to taking over the town of Khirbat al-Naqus, in the strategically important Sahl al-Ghab plain in the north-west of Hama province.
A Syrian military source confirmed the attacks, according to the Reuters news agency.
Latakia is the heartland of President Bashar al-Assad's Alawite sect, and the Sahl al-Ghab lies just to the east of the coastal mountains where Mr Assad's ancestral village of Qardaha is located.
Meanwhile, the Syrian Observatory said four people were killed in heavy government air strikes in northern Homs province.
Twenty-two civilians were killed over the weekend in Aleppo, with at least 16 dying as a result of rebel shell- and sniper-fire and the six others dying in government air strikes, according to the group.
Militants from the group known as Islamic State (IS), which along with the rival jihadist group al-Nusra Front is excluded from the cessation of hostilities, have meanwhile seized more territory from rebel groups near the Turkish border north of Aleppo, forcing some 35,000 civilians to flee towards the opposition-held town of Azaz.
Medecins Sans Frontieres warned on Monday that the situation was now critical for more than 100,000 displaced people trapped around Azaz, with active fighting just 7km (four miles) away and the border closed for all but the most seriously ill Syrians.

Tata is making 1,050 people redundant, including 750 at its Port Talbot site.
Community organiser Rob Edwards said he was surprised by Mr Koehler's departure and what it meant for the future.
"I think it compounds the recent news about the redundancies. You start to ask questions about long-term investments," said Mr Edwards.
"There is an element of doubt, we walk a path of uncertainty," he told BBC Radio Wales's Wales at Work programme.
He added that he wasn't concerned about the short-term commitments made by the company as it tries to save Â£300m as part of its current survival plan.
He said the union was worried that the move weakened the voice of the European operation when it came to decisions being made by the board in future.

Article: "We have big ideas for the future, and part of making them happen is building Instagram into a sustainable business," it said.
Ads will appear in a few months and involve just a handful of firms.
Instagram was bought by Facebook for $1bn (Â£619m), but has never made a profit.
The company, which now has 150 million users, has been a favourite among consumers but has long left analysts wondering how it could turn enthusiasm among photographers into a business model.
Early efforts by Instagram to generate revenue were met with user backlash, such as when the company changed the terms of service to seemingly indicate that it would own user images and could sell those images to advertisers.
The failure of this move was acknowledged in the company's posting.
"As always, you own your own photos and videos. The introduction of advertising won't change this," it said.
In an interview earlier this year with the BBC, Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom said that Instagram must "fund its own future."
Social media advertising is a booming business in the US.
According to research firm eMarketer, advertisers will spend $9.5bn on social network ads worldwide this year.

Article: The Scottish National Party had argued that its Commons leader enjoyed the support of more MPs than Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.
There are currently 54 SNP MPs but only 40 of Labour's 229 MPs expressed support for Mr Corbyn on Tuesday.
Speaker John Bercow said he had sought expert advice.
He said Labour "currently constitutes" the official opposition and its leader is recognised by the Speaker "for statutory and parliamentary purposes" as the leader of the opposition.
Mr Bercow was replying to a point of order raised by SNP MP Pete Wishart, who told the Speaker that Labour had lost two-thirds of its shadow cabinet and its leader no longer commanded the majority of his backbench MPs.
The SNP MP said: "It can now longer provide shadows for large departments of State. It is in clearly in no shape to assume power and meet these key responsibilities and obligations as outlined in Erskine May (the parliamentary rulebook)."
The SNP said it would be able to fill all of the relevant shadow posts to the government.
Mr Corbyn has still not appointed a shadow Scottish secretary.
The previous incumbent, Ian Murray, has not been replaced after becoming one of more than 20 members of Labour's shadow cabinet to quit earlier this week in an effort to force Mr Corbyn to resign.
Mr Corbyn subsequently lost a vote of no confidence by 172 votes to 40 but said the ballot had "no constitutional legitimacy" and that he would not "betray" the members who voted for him by resigning.
His allies have challenged Mr Corbyn's critics to trigger a formal leadership contest if they want to replace him.
Earlier, Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell - who has remained loyal to Mr Corbyn - said the SNP would "always play a few stunts and you can't blame them for that".
The SNP won 56 seats at last May's election, but Michelle Thomson and Natalie McGarry have since withdrawn from the party whip amid police investigations.

Article: Gurpal Virdi, 56, of Hounslow, west London, was acquitted by the jury at Southwark Crown Court.
Mr Virdi had denied indecently assaulting a male prisoner and misconduct in public office.
The charges dated back to on or before 7 November 1986.
During the trial Mr Virdi accused the Metropolitan Police of bringing the criminal case against him as part of a 17-year campaign to "hound" him out of the force.
The retired detective claimed the police had tried to discredit him after he gave evidence to the Stephen Lawrence inquiry about racism within the police force.
He told jurors: "This is a typical reaction from a department that has hounded me since 1998, investigating me and following me around and bugging my phone.
Mr Virdi retired from the Metropolitan Police in 2012 after 30 years of service.

Article: Having won their opener before losing race two on Saturday, Ben Ainslie's Land Rover BAR were defeated by defending champions Oracle Team USA and Emirates Team New Zealand on Sunday.
A nosedive after gate three resulted a 39-second defeat for BAR against USA.
We very, very nearly sunk
And despite a penalty, New Zealand beat BAR by one minute and 28 seconds.
It looked promising for Ainslie's team when they led USA into the first gate, before skipper Jimmy Spithill's Oracle charged into the lead. A mistake after gate three cost the GB catamaran more time.
There followed another defeat, this time against New Zealand. The Kiwis were handed a two-boat-length penalty after the start having crossed the boundary, but they still managed a handsome win following a poor turn by BAR at gate two.
*Land Rover BAR started the qualifiers with two points and Oracle Team USA with one point after finishing first and second respectively in the 2015-16 America's Cup World Series.
**The top four teams progress to the next round
Land Rover BAR CEO Martin Whitmarsh, the former chief of McLaren's F1 team, said Ainslie's catamaran almost perished during the defeat by Japan on Saturday.
BAR's port hull careered into Japan's starboard hull prior to the race.
"We very, very nearly sunk," Land Rover BAR CEO Martin Whitmarsh told the Daily Telegraph. "It was foiled back so we didn't take too much water on. When we got back here and went down on the hull, very quickly it began filling with water.
"If we had left it in the water for a few more minutes it would have sunk. You've got all the electronics, everything.
"I could have climbed up through the hull yesterday, it was that big. We're talking about 20ft in terms of length."
Despite the extensive damage, BAR's shore team worked through the night to have the catamaran race-ready for Sunday.
It was a great Sunday for USA who won all three of their races. The French catamaran also recorded its first win, with victory over Sweden's Artemis.
New Zealand also added to their success over BAR by defeating Japan, who currently prop up the table.

Each team will race each other twice in the qualifiers, scoring one point per win, with the top four teams progressing to the challenger round.
Land Rover BAR started the qualifiers with two points and Oracle Team USA with one after finishing first and second respectively in the 2015-16 America's Cup World Series.
The top four challengers are split into two best-of-five semi-finals from 4 June, with the winners competing in the final for the right to take on holders Oracle Team USA - who are also taking part in the qualifiers - in the actual America's Cup matches.
The first to seven points wins the America's Cup, or the Auld Mug as the trophy is known, with a possible 13 races to be sailed on 17-18 and 24-27 June.
The America's Cup, the oldest competition in international sport, was first raced in 1851 around the Isle of Wight and has only been won by four nations.

Article: Mr Cairns said it would be "completely wrong" to remain in the EU's single market as both major UK parties told voters they wanted to leave.
But he played down differences with the Welsh Government over Brexit.
The UK government is under pressure to change its approach to leaving the EU, which critics call a "hard Brexit".
Mr Cairns's predecessor, Stephen Crabb, claimed the election had changed the terms of the Brexit debate.
The Preseli Pembrokeshire MP is backing calls from Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson for Theresa May to adopt a more flexible approach that achieves a consensus across parties.
Mr Crabb told BBC Wales: "The majority of business opinion in Wales and the UK supports Britain staying in the single market and staying in the customs union but still coming out of the European Union legally.
"And I think that argument needs to get looked at far more closely and if we can't achieve a satisfactory deal based on membership of the single market we need something that is pretty close to it if it's going to achieve the consensus that it needs to across the parties."
Wales Office Minister Guto Bebb said the process of listening to devolved governments had begun.
"It is seven times more important now because of the result of the election that the devolved countries have a real voice in the process of leaving the European Union," he said.
Mr Cairns, newly re-appointed to his role, said he wanted Brexit negotiations, due to start next week, to focus on the right outcome with businesses trading freely.
"We've talked about frictionless trade, the Welsh Government have talked about unfettered access. These are one and the same things," he said.
"Even the Labour Party don't want to remain part of the single market so it would be completely wrong to stay in the single market when the two largest parties are opposed to that."
But Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire MP Simon Hart echoed Mr Crabb's call for cross-party consensus.
He said he did not buy the idea that because Theresa May has had "an unquestionably difficult time for which she takes some of the blame" it means "it's game over".

Article: They held private meetings with Theresa May in the wake of the Hillsborough inquests, which ended in April.
Jurors found the fans who died as a result of the 1989 crush were unlawfully killed.
The families also complained about the conduct of South Yorkshire Police.
They called on the home secretary to put the force into remedial measures.
It is understood the proposed 'Hillsborough Law' would seek to place a further onus on those in public office to cooperate positively with investigations.
The families were told about developments in two ongoing criminal investigations into the disaster at the meetings with the home secretary, which were held in Warrington.
Theresa May has previously praised the dignity and determination of the victims' relatives.
Chair of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, Margaret Aspinall, whose son James died in the disaster, said: "I myself for the very first time felt - I'm sure the families did as well - that at last there's a home secretary that's actually listening to them."
The home secretary has met some Hillsborough families before, but this is the first time that she's spoken directly to them since the inquests ended.
Theresa May spent several hours in Warrington, meeting separately with the two main groups of relatives.
The atmosphere was said to be heated, with some of the families complaining directly to her about the conduct of South Yorkshire Police during the inquests.
Some relatives asked for assurances that there will be criminal prosecutions, and I'm told that they wanted to make sure that the home secretary personally understood the emotional toll that the two-year inquests have taken.
Although the Hillsborough families welcomed the jury's finding of unlawful killing, they know that many months of uncertainty lie ahead before they find out whether criminal trials will follow.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission revealed that 19 people have refused to assist with their probe into the conduct of officers from West Midlands Police, which investigated the tragedy.
The watchdog has now handed files on suspects to the Crown Prosecution Service in its largest-ever inquiry into alleged criminality and alleged police misconduct.
The IPCC has contacted 258 officers and staff members involved in the investigation into the tragedy and a total of 161 statements have been taken.
The watchdog said: "Our intention remains to submit full files of evidence to the CPS by the turn of the year to enable decisions to be made on whether any individuals should be charged."

Article: Inciting people to harass others online, known as virtual mobbing, could also result in court action, under new Crown Prosecution Service guidance.
The director of public prosecutions said it means the CPS would prosecute just as if offences occurred offline.
But she stressed this did not mean prosecutors could "stifle free speech".
The new guidance aims to help police identify online crimes more easily.
It also highlights those who post people's personal information, such as bank details - known as doxxing.
Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said: "The internet's not an anonymous place where people can post without any consequences. People should think about their own conduct.
"If you are grossly abusive to people, if you are bullying or harassing people online, then we will prosecute in the same way as if you did it offline."
However, Ms Saunders said context will be an important factor in decisions - for example "if you're offensive, the legislation would say you have to be grossly offensive, and that's quite a high test".
One woman, who wished to remain anonymous, said she and her daughter, who has Down's Syndrome, had suffered such severe online abuse over the last six years that they had to move house three times.
The abuse started, she said, when a friend wrote a book about trolls - anonymously but mentioning her by name.
"The trolls photoshopped images of myself and my daughter on to pornography and posted it on Facebook. They have said I'm a paedophile and called her hateful names like mongoloid; they even set up a website in her name."
The woman believes the trolls kept getting hold of her details using official forms she submitted when complaining at the use of images of her daughter.
"Even after we moved, they have called us at three of four in the morning threatening to petrol-bomb our house if we will not give up the name of the author.
"It's been horrific - this trolling is not free speech; it's hate speech," she said.
She added that one of the men stood outside the family home and followed her daughter to school, taking pictures.
The incidents are now being investigated by police.
Kevin Healey told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme he had been abused online for five years over his autism campaign work.
He said: "Not even one troll has been prosecuted or jailed, even though I have made complaints to Twitter and the police.
"It's been a nightmare; it's been horrific - it doesn't go away. It's with you 24 hours and seven days a week, there's no escape from it".
Mr Healey said he doesn't think the changes will make any difference and wants changes to legislation in the UK - and abroad.
"With the laws in the UK, if someone is trolling you from outside the UK - and my last batch of trolls were from the US - the police said we can't do anything," he added.
The CPS says it will use "considerable caution" before charging those posting "grossly offensive" material.
The changes come after a report found that one in four teenagers is abused online over their sexual orientation, race, religion, gender or disability.
The CPS also said underage "sexting" between consenting children in a relationship should not be prosecuted, but cases which involve "exploitation, grooming or bullying" may lead to legal action.
Ms Saunders told the BBC: "If they are children, they are the same age, there's no suggestion or any coercion or bad motives, then we would not expect that case to be prosecuted. It shows you how careful you have to be about the context of it," she said.
Asked about whether guidelines on misogynistic hate crimes would be introduced, Ms Saunders said: "We probably need to think about it."
A new law on revenge porn - someone uploading explicit images or film of a former partner to humiliate or embarrass them - has led to the prosecution of 206 people across England and Wales since its introduction in April 2015.
The public policy statements on hate crime will be subject to public consultation for 13 weeks.

Article: His grandmother offered him a plate of grapes, but she doesn't remember whether Faizan had it. The son of a farmer then put on his pheran, the woollen cape-like garment Kashmiris wear, and quietly left for his Sunday lessons.
A few hours later, Faizan lay dead near a sun-baked school playground, ringed by bare walnut and willow trees. Paramilitary soldiers, eyewitnesses alleged, had shot him in the back of his head.
Carrying a packet of biscuits, he was returning home on a bright, nippy morning when he encountered a throng of local people protesting against Indian rule near the school, where polling was taking place for a parliamentary by-election.
Eyewitnesses say four shots rang out of the single-storey, squat school building which, according to some reports, was being pelted with stones thrown by protesters from a hill above and from the road in front.
Faizan possibly halted to find out what the commotion was all about, and was hit by a bullet. Two neighbours ran up to his home to deliver the news. His mother had sprinted down to the playground, hugged her bleeding son and let others take him to hospital.
"I knew he was gone," Zarifa told me.
A heart-wrenching video recorded by a villager on his mobile phone minutes after the killing shows a wailing man cradling the dead boy, blood streaming down his broken face, in a packed vehicle taking him to the nearest hospital. There, the doctors declared him dead.
Faizan's final journey is recorded on another mobile phone video: his slight frame, draped in white, bobbing slightly on a hospital cot, carried through a sea of weeping, agitated mourners extolling their latest "martyr". By late afternoon, his body was lowered into the grave near his village, Dalwan.
Faizan was among the eight people killed on Sunday when paramilitary soldiers fired bullets and shotgun pellets at those protesting against Indian rule at polling centres near Srinagar, the summer capital. Election authorities say some 170 people, including 100 security personnel, were injured in about 200 incidents of stone pelting and violent protests on the day.
The voter turnout in Sunday's election was an abysmal 7.1% - the lowest in decades - and came as a huge setback for the region's mainstream parties.
The soldiers had been brought in from other states to secure polling stations and may have been unprepared to deal with "protests and provocation" in a complex conflict zone like Kashmir, a senior official told me.
One report said the police had registered complaints against the paramilitary forces for firing into the crowds.
Separatist groups had rejected the elections and urged voters to boycott Sunday's poll, which took place after a politician resigned over what he described as the "anti-people" agenda of the Indian government.
Disillusioned voters - even in relatively peaceful places like Dalwan where people turned out to cast their votes enthusiastically in previous elections - generally stayed away.
Why Faizan was killed on a day when local voters rejected the ballot is not clear.
By all accounts, he was not pelting stones or hurling abuse at the soldiers. One report said police fired tear gas shells to keep the protesters away from the empty polling station, but the soldiers opened fire.
Whatever it is, Faizan became another grisly statistic in Kashmir's unending tragedy.
A picture taken by his friend on his mobile phone during their winter break shows the shy-looking boy - "he would often top his class, and he was very knowledgeable about the world," the friend said - clad in a woollen cap and collared jacket, peering uneasily into the camera.
"He was quiet and studious, he was doing well in school. He played cricket, and counted [former Indian captain] MS Dhoni as his favourite cricketer. He wanted to become a doctor," a cousin told me, when I visited the family.
Grief is the price one pays for love. Zarifa's lament for her dead son filled the still air inside a tent outside their home where local women had gathered to mourn.
"My son, my son, where will I find you now?" she cried, again and again.
Then she stepped out of the tent, entered her home and joined her husband in a dank, cold room. He sat there, stoic and numb, surrounded by mourners, and gazed vacantly at the pastel pink walls. The room had a red carpet and red window curtains.
"The blood of a martyr never goes waste," said Fayaz Ahmad Dar. "One day, the blood of innocents will help us gain our freedom [from Indian rule]."
A brief silence followed. Zarifa broke it, bemoaning the loss of her boy.
"I am looking at your books, I am looking at your school bags. How will I touch your books again, my son? Everybody would talk about your intelligence, how you would answer every question with so much wit."
Outside the secondary school - Enter to learn, Leave to serve, its motto, is engraved on the walls - a group of young men gathered later in the day. Their eyes seethed in anger. They spoke about frustration, alienation, desperation, humiliation and hopelessness.
They said they had lost their fear of life. They insisted that they helped rebels because "they are our brothers and don't kill civilians" and are "fighting for freedom".
More than half of them raised their hands when asked whether they had pelted stones at Indian forces.
"We are not safe in our own homes, we are not safe on streets. They are killing little boys now. Life is uncertain," said Feroze Ali, a school clerk.
Since February alone, some two dozen civilians have been killed during gunfights between armed rebels and security forces. The security forces have accused civilians of helping rebels escape.
The army says it has tried to reach out and engage with civilians through its 29 schools, youth clubs and cricket tournaments.
Recently some 19,000 Kashmiri young men applied for a few hundred vacancies in the army.
"Provocation and panic can lead to accidents. Security forces often fire when they face life threatening situations. But protecting civilians remains our first priority in this situation. When a civilian dies, it hurts us," an army officer told me.
The region has seen heightened tension and increased unrest since July when influential militant Burhan Wani was killed by Indian forces. More than 100 civilians lost their lives in clashes with protesters during a four-month-long lockdown, including a 55-day-curfew, in the restive Muslim-majority valley.
Kashmir, clearly, appears to be teetering on the brink of an open public revolt against Indian rule.
Many say the federal government's near-complete lack of engagement and dialogue with local stakeholders and Pakistan, a complete mistrust of the local government and a lack of development and jobs have left most people jittery and alienated.
Militancy continues to be at low ebb - there are an estimated 250 militants in the state now of which 150 are local - compared to several thousand during the peak of insurgency in the 1990s.
But young Kashmiris - more than 60% of the men in the valley are under 30, and more than 40% of men in Kashmir are jobless - are restless and angry. The local political parties are in danger of "becoming irrelevant", as a leader of an opposition party told me.
"This is the worst situation that I have seen. Earlier, it was a movement led by the militants. Now it is being led by the people," says Feroze Ali, 35, a schoolteacher.
"India needs to be worried, very worried about this."

Article: Bids have been submitted by Abellio, Arriva, KeolisAmey and MTR for the next Wales and Borders franchise.
The successful bidder will have to make a slice of its profits available to be reinvested in the railway.
They will also be responsible for delivering a major upgrade to the rail network in and around Cardiff as part of the Metro scheme.
A contract will be awarded in early 2018.
The four bids are being assessed by Transport for Wales (TfW), a Welsh government-owned company, as part of what ministers said would be an "ambitious and creative not for profit model".
Officials said the four preferred bidders were the only four to come forward for the contract.
The Welsh government has set out its ambitions for the Metro but it will be up to the bidders to propose how it will operate, as well as drawing up plans to build a new rail or tram system.
Analysis by Sarah Dickins, BBC Wales economics correspondent
This is the first time that the Welsh Government has awarded a rail franchise. It did not have the power to do so when the all-Wales franchise was awarded to Arriva.
The model this time will focus on what level and quality of service the various bidders can offer. They will be asked to outline what they will do to drive up the numbers of passengers taking trains and buses across Wales.
While the Metro for south Wales will be part of the bid, the company's proposals will also be scrutinised in terms of how they will affect all geographical locations.
Whichever company wins will have a cap set on how much profit they can make. We do not yet know at what level that will be set but once that is passed remaining profit will go to the body responsible - Transport for Wales - to be reinvested in public transport in Wales. That cap will be for negotiation.
Each company is expected to put together its own particular mix of heavy rail, bus and possibly light rail. The preferred contractor is expected to be known by early 2018.
Negotiations are underway with Network Rail about handing over responsibility for the track on the core Valleys lines to the franchise holder.
The current franchise is run by Arriva Trains Wales which gets a subsidy from the Welsh Government of between £150m and £180m a year.
Rail privatisation laws stop the Welsh Government giving the contract to public sector bodies.
The Welsh Government has lobbied for more powers, but said its requests have been turned down in Westminster.
Officials said in time TfW may evolve to take on more responsibilities, similar to Transport for London.
Economy Secretary Ken Skates said new trains, quicker journeys and modernised technology were priorities for the franchise.
"We now have four highly skilled, experienced companies entering the next, competitive phase and I am keen to hear more from them about what they can offer Wales and how they can deliver on our plans for integrated public transport," he said.
"Over the next 10 years I envisage significant strides in the delivery of our public transport network including the electrification of the Swansea, Valleys and north Wales lines, a South and North Wales Metro and widespread structural improvements that are already in the pipeline."

Article: Jones, 31, suffered a shin injury while on international duty with Trinidad and Tobago on Tuesday.
Cardiff manager Russell Slade said there was no break and Jones will be assessed once he returns to Wales.
"We're hoping he will be in on Sunday," said Slade. "We don't know how long he'll be out for."
This is the second time in the space of two months Jones has been unavailable for Cardiff following international duty.
He missed the opening four games of the season after being deemed unfit following his involvement in the Gold Cup, held in America and Canada in July.
The latest set-back came in his country's goalless draw with Nicaragua in Port of Spain when he was carried off on a stretcher after 73 minutes.
"It's not broken, that's the most important thing, but there is a lot of swelling there. It will be assessed the moment he lands," said Slade.
Jones' injury ends a miserable week for Slade that also saw him lose defender Bruno Ecuele Manga for at least two months to a groin injury sustained while training with Gabon.
"As with Bruno, it's difficult to get the information you require," added Slade of Jones' condition.
Cardiff missed the striker's presence on Saturday in a dour stalemate with Preston.
Slade admitted his side were poor as they registered two efforts on target against a team that started the afternoon on the bottom of the Championship table.
"I didn't think we got going until 50 or 60 minutes into the game and that can't happen," he said.
"Clearly it's not something we designed or wanted. We set out exactly what we wanted to do but we didn't do that.
"It can happen away from home sometimes, but it's dangerous because when you come up against top opposition, they will punish you in those periods.
"We haven't served up too many halves like that so benefit of the doubt.
"We came out for the second half and looked like a team again that wanted to go on and win a football match."
Slade's mood on Saturday evening would not have been helped when one of his discarded strikers, Javi Guerra, put Rayo Vallecano in front against Barcelona in La Liga at the Nou Camp.

Article: The 80-year-old, a champion of the Doric dialect, was a compere and producer of variety shows before branching out into broadcasting.
He has presented the Scottish dance music show Take the Floor since the early 1980s.
BBC Scotland director Ken MacQuarrie said: "Robbie is one of Scotland's most recognisable voices."
Robbie, explaining his broadcasting philosophy, said: "I like to think that I am broadcasting to a lady in the top tenement in Glasgow at the same time as I am chatting to a lady in a croft."
Thousands of listeners tune in to Take the Floor on Saturday evenings.
But Robbie has decided it is now time to step down from the show - and this weekend will be his final programme as permanent host.
Born in Dunecht in Aberdeenshire in 1936, he admits that when he first entered broadcasting he was initially "slated" for his accent in some quarters, and was just a "rough and ready country loon".
Since then his work has been recognised with an MBE, and he was also inducted into a hall of fame by the Trad Music Awards.
His career has included stints on BBC Scotland's Beechgrove Garden and presenting televised sheepdog trials.
As well as his broadcast work, Robbie has been a regular commentator on the Highland Games circuit - including the famous Braemar Gathering which is attended by The Queen and members of the royal family - and a much-travelled concert compere.
He has written books on Scottish dance music and Scottish country dancing, and has written a newspaper column in Doric.
Robbie, who turned 80 in May this year, prepares for Take the Floor at BBC Scotland's Beechgrove Terrace base.
Robbie said of the future: "I am taking a break, that is for sure."
He added with a smile: "But, as they say, I am a wanted man. I hope sincerely you have not heard the last of this Doric voice."
Mr MacQuarrie said: "Robbie is one Scotland's most recognisable voices and, over the years, he has been like a close family friend for many of our listeners.
"A passionate supporter of traditional Scottish music, Robbie has, over more than three decades, shared his in-depth knowledge and his infectious enthusiasm with generations of Radio Scotland audiences.
"I'd like to thank him personally, both for his work with Radio Scotland and also for his passionate commitment, championing Scottish traditional music across the country.
"Although we're grateful that he'll continue to work for us on one-off broadcasts in future, we wish him well as he prepares to Take the Floor for the final time."
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was "sad" the "broadcasting legend" was stepping down from Take the Floor and wished him the best.
Robbie said: "It has been 35 years of top-class music. From the great masters of the past to present-day performers, Scottish dance music continues to be a vibrant scene.
"So the time has come for me to hand over to a younger presenter (Gary Innes) and wish the Take the Floor team aw the best."
He added: "I would also like to thank the many hundreds of musicians, whose music we've featured, and the audiences in halls at our recordings across the country who have provided a great atmosphere for the show.
"I'll be looking fur ye all and aw the best."
Robbie, who is married to Esma, concluded: "It's been 35 years of sheer pleasure."
Robbie's final Take the Floor will be broadcast on Saturday 17 September at 19:00.

Article: The union is supporting a campaign to stop Bangor University student Shiromini Satkunarajah being deported to Sri Lanka.
The 20-year-old has been taken to a detention centre after being refused asylum.
The Home Office said it considers each case carefully.
Miss Satkunarajah, who was born in Sri Lanka but has lived in the UK for eight years, is due to finish her electrical engineering degree this summer.
She was arrested on Tuesday and taken to a detention centre to await deportation on 28 February.
Thousands of people have signed a petition to stop her deportation.
NUS Wales deputy president Carmen Smith told BBC Wales: "We want the home secretary to stop the callous and inhumane deportation of Shiromini.
"She doesn't have any family or friends in Sri Lanka. Wales is her home.
"She has three months left of her degree. It's a brutal thing to do at such a time in her educational experience."
Arfon MP Hywel Williams said the UK government should use "common sense" in dealing with Miss Satkunarajah's case.
"She has three months to go before she graduates in a field where we really do need people and she's an excellent student," he said.
"There is a certain amount of discretion they can operate and I really wish they would."
A Home Office spokeswoman said: "We do not routinely comment on individual cases.
"The UK has a proud history of granting asylum to those who genuinely need it and every case is carefully considered on its individual merits."

Article: Following flooding at Brunton Park, Carlisle have three 'home' fixtures at neutral grounds and beat Notts County at Preston's Deepdale on Saturday.
Stanley's last two home games were postponed because of waterlogging.
"I'm really upset about how the league's handled the Carlisle affair," Coleman told BBC Radio Lancashire.
"We are now games behind Carlisle. We've had two postponements and they've been allowed to play elsewhere and I don't think it's right or fair.
"I don't think it's fair on the rest of the 23 teams who have to go to Carlisle when some teams won't have to go there.
"I just don't think it's anywhere near any shape or form fair.
"I've got nothing against Carlisle, I wish them all the best in their ventures and what they do, but it's shifting the rules.
"I've got every sympathy for the people that have lost belongings and homes, I'm not decrying any of that - I'm just saying strictly from a football point of view it's an unfair advantage to play at another ground."
The Cumbrians will also play upcoming matches at Blackburn's Ewood Park and Blackpool's Bloomfield Road.

Article: It had aimed to raise £10m of investments in the club from small-scale retail buyers of shares.
There was already a commitment to the major part of the share offer, with rich individuals and institutional investors signing up to at least £17m.
The club announced on Tuesday evening that it had raised a total of £22.2m.
On Wednesday morning, the shares in Rangers International Football Club plc will start trading on London's Alternative Investments Market (AIM).
It is part of the London Stock Exchange, on which shares in Celtic Football Club are also traded.
The deadline for fans to buy new shares in the club passed on Tuesday afternoon.
A statement from Rangers said: "A total of £22.2 million has been raised from professional and institutional investors and supporters which will be used to take the club forward, strengthen the squad when appropriate and improve facilities."
Chief executive Charles Green said: "This is an exciting time for everyone associated with this 140-year-old institution but we are just at the start of the journey.
"We are rebuilding and Rangers will rise again and we will do so with the help of our fans and the institutional investors who are on board."
Mr Green was listed as the club's main shareholder in the share prospectus with a stake of almost 15%, which will now be diluted. He had not planned to add to his shares.
Newcastle owner Mike Ashley was the third largest shareholder with 9% before the issue of extra shares, behind a consortium called Blue Pitch Holdings.
Meanwhile, Green took to the Ibrox pitch to address the crowd ahead of the 3-0 win over Annan Athletic to announce how much been raised through a share issue.
However, while his speech was taking place, a section of the support staged a protest against potential plans to sell the stadium naming rights.
After his side's 3-0 win, Rangers manager Ally McCoist described it as "a great day off the park".
"The fact that it's in the region of £22m, and for the fans to chip in with roughly £5m, I think is absolutely staggering," he said.
"They've only had the opportunity to do that in the last week or so.
"In the lead-up to Christmas, when finances are tight at the best of times, in a recession, for our supporters to go into their pockets and come up with that money is another incredible show of support for this football club.
"I think the best way I can put it is, the one thing the investors and, certainly, the fans deserve is for their money to be used wisely.
"And I would certainly hope to have an opportunity to use some of that money wisely."

Article: The hosts led when Ben Richards-Everton volleyed home but Jordan Hugill slotted in to equalise for the visitors.
With four minutes of extra time left, Jordan Clark restored the lead but Hugill levelled again in added time.
But Billy Kee struck in the third minute of stoppage time to give Stanley victory over their Lancashire rivals.
Kee also scored in Accrington's 3-1 win against Colchester on the opening day of League Two.
They have now knocked out higher league opposition in the EFL Cup for the second successive year after they beat Burnley last season.
Accrington Stanley boss John Coleman told BBC Radio Lancashire:
"I'm delighted with the result as it was a difficult game. It was a full-blooded derby and just to be competing against teams like this on what we believe is a level playing field is testament to how far the club's come.
"Preston are a good side and they showed that. They moved the ball really well and we knew that from when we played them in a pre-season friendly.
"We were a different animal tonight. We created far more problems for them."
Preston North End manager Alex Neil told BBC Radio Lancashire:
"To be honest we shouldn't have been forcing for extra-time. At 1-1 we looked like we were going to go on and win the game.
"When we conceded the corner I thought I've seen this a million times before. We conceded from a set piece which is really frustrating.
"If you look at the game, we had numerous opportunities and chances, we didn't take them or make them count and ultimately we got punished because of that."

Article: The defendants allegedly used "unofficial" company credit cards for luxury purchases, unconnected with their duties as board members.
Prosecutors say about €12m (£10.4m; $13.5m) was spent on hotels, fine clothes, entertainment and travel.
Mr Rato denies wrongdoing. Bankia was rescued in 2012 at huge public expense.
The unofficial credit card purchases were not declared to the tax authorities. The system allegedly started at Caja Madrid bank and was continued by Mr Rato when Bankia was created in 2011.
How Spanish activists landed ex-IMF chief in court
A member of the governing centre-right Popular Party (PP), Mr Rato resigned as head of Bankia shortly before its near-collapse in 2012.
The government bailout of Bankia inflicted losses on 200,000 small investors, who held preferential shares in the bank.
Some of them voiced their anger outside the Madrid courthouse on Monday. "You wretches! Stealing money from pensioners!" they shouted at the accused as the trial got under way.
Prosecutors are seeking four-and-a-half years in jail for Mr Rato and six years for Miguel Blesa, the former president of Caja Madrid, a bank that was merged with six others in 2011 to create Bankia.
If found guilty, Mr Rato could also face a €2.7m fine, and Mr Blesa a fine of €9.3m.
Mr Rato headed the International Monetary Fund from 2004-2007. He also served as Spanish economy minister, and his fall from grace helped fuel accusations that the Popular Party was riddled with corruption.
Prosecutors say the lavish credit card purchases took place from 2003-2012 - some of them during Spain's financial crisis, when millions of citizens suffered hardship and unemployment soared.
Mr Rato's two successors at the top of the IMF have also been caught up in high-profile court cases.
French Socialist Dominique Strauss-Kahn took over from Mr Rato in 2007 but resigned in May 2011 to defend himself against charges of attempted rape in New York. Prosecutors dropped the charges later that year, then Mr Strauss-Kahn reached an out-of-court settlement with the hotel maid who accused him.
In a separate case last year, he was acquitted by a French court of the charge of "aggravated pimping" in connection with sex parties involving prostitutes.
Mr Strauss-Kahn's successor at the IMF, Christine Lagarde, is to go on trial in France in December over a state award of €285m in damages to tycoon Bernard Tapie when she was finance minister. She is accused of "negligence", but denies any misconduct.

Article: Andrew Bickel, 39, was fixing a light at the Catwel shop in Cardiff two weeks ago when he nipped out to his van and returned to find his tools were gone.
He said he had a call from a lady in the cat charity shop to say his tools were there to collect, but with "no explanation of how, why or when".
Mr Bickel's original Facebook post about the mistake went viral.
He said he had enjoyed his five minutes of fame afterwards.
"I couldn't believe it," he said, "the phone just didn't stop ringing."
"The Sun newspaper came down to where I was working and took photographs, television crews wanted to film me and I even had an offer to appear on Judge Rinder," he added.
"I'm just waiting for the call to go into the jungle."
Mr Bickel said he had been offered £100 by a magazine for his story and, if it happened, he would donate £50 to the cat charity shop and £50 to a dog charity shop, after admitting he was "more of a dog person".
"I'm just glad no-one has been left out of pocket," he said.

Article: Commanders lowered the flag during a ceremony in Kabul - raising the flag of the new mission named Resolute Support.
"We have lifted the Afghan people out of the darkness of  despair and given them hope for the future," mission commander Gen John  Campbell said.
Nato's Afghan deployment began after the 9/11 attacks against the US.
From 1 January the alliance's role will shift to a mainly training and support mission for the Afghan army.
Sunday's ceremony was low-key - held inside a gymnasium at the alliance headquarters away from the public.
A military band played as the flag of the International Security and Assistance Force (Isaf) was lowered in the presence of senior military personnel from both sides.
Unfurling the new flag, Gen Campbell said the mission "will serve as the bedrock of an enduring partnership" between Nato and Afghanistan.
"We honour coalition and Afghan fallen in this mighty struggle, those who paid the price for Afghanistan's freedom," he said, adding: "The road before us remains challenging but we will triumph."
At its peak, the US-led Isaf deployment involved more than 130,000 personnel from 50 countries.
But from 1 January, it will bring together around 12,000 men and women from Nato allies and 14 partner nations.
"The security of Afghanistan will be fully in the hands of the country's 350,000 Afghan soldiers and police. But Nato allies, together with many partner nations, will remain to train, advise and assist them," said Nato Secretary General  Jens Stoltenberg in a statement.
More than a decade after this long and expensive mission began, the Taliban are still active and gaining in strength, launching a number of attacks in recent months, says the BBC's Sanjoy Majumder in Kabul.
This year has been the bloodiest in Afghanistan since 2001, with at least 4,600 members of the Afghan security forces dying in the fight against the Taliban.
It underscores the challenges that lie ahead of the Afghan security forces, our correspondent says.
Nearly 3,500 foreign troops have been killed since the beginning of the Nato mission.

Article: The veteran broadcaster died of cancer on Sunday at the age of 77.
The books, in Sir Terry's birthplace of Limerick, will allow people to mark the passing of "a true son of Limerick", the city's mayor Liam Galvin said.
Evans told listeners of the BBC Radio 2 show that made Sir Terry's name: "He was the absolute governor."
A condolence book for Sir Terry has also been opened in the entrance of the BBC's New Broadcasting House in London.
In a career spanning 50 years, Sir Terry hosted TV chat shows, fronted the Eurovision Song Contest and was the face of Children in Need, while his long-running Radio 2 breakfast show regularly drew millions of listeners.
At the start of his breakfast show on Monday, Evans said: "He was radio's Eric Morecambe, Ronnie Barker, he was our Captain Mainwaring, our Basil Fawlty but he made us laugh every day for two hours and for over 30 years.
"All unscripted, all ad lib, always supremely assured, unwaveringly confident.
"And do you know why? Because he never took any of this seriously, least of all himself. He was the butt of most of his jokes.
"Laugh and the world laughs with you, sure, but Terry knew that if you go one better, and laugh at yourself then you're really onto something."
Evans described Sir Terry as his "radio dad" and said that Radio 2 was "in disbelief and shock".
"He taught me so much about being on the radio and not being on the radio," added Evans. "He was the absolute governor, everybody knows that."
BBC Radio 4 Today presenter John Humphrys also paid tribute on Monday's programme, calling Sir Terry "one of the greatest broadcasters of our age".
"Terry would be surprised by that description, at least, he'd affect to be. He liked to say that he never did anything, that required more than the minimal effort, and his success was down to 'natural laziness'. Which of course was complete rubbish," he said.
"You didn't get to be the consummate professional he was by being lazy. It's true that he had a few God-given advantages - he was charming and articulate and witty and quick-thinking and whimsical and subversive and sardonic and, well, the list is a very long one.
"But Terry had something else as well. He liked his audience, and they liked him. They felt he wasn't broadcasting to the nation, he was just talking to them."
Prime Minister David Cameron told Jeremy Vine's BBC Radio 2 show Sir Terry was a "wonderful human being".
"I remember growing up watching Blankety Blank and then the Eurovision Song Contest and he always made you smile, made you laugh. He had this fantastic sense of humour," he said.
Veteran broadcaster Sir Jimmy Young, who worked with Sir Terry on Radio 2, said he was "stunned" at the news and that his condolences were "very much with Helen and the family".
Sir Terry died surrounded by his family "after a short but brave battle with cancer", a statement released by his family said.
He leaves his wife, Helen, and their three children. The couple also had a daughter who died in infancy.
An online book of condolences will be hosted on Limerick's official website www.limerick.ie with separate books of condolence at council buildings in Dooradoyle and Merchants Quay opening on Monday morning.
The city's mayor said: "Despite his fame and the fact that he was based in the UK throughout much of his career, Sir Terry often returned home to Limerick and never missed an opportunity on radio or TV to speak about his Limerick roots.
"The council honoured him with the title of Freeman of Limerick in 2007, which I know was a title that meant very much to him and his family."
President of the Irish Republic Michael D Higgins has said Sir Terry was "always proud of his origins in Limerick", and returned frequently to his native country.
Family friend and broadcaster Henry Kelly added that he was "shocked" to hear of his death because Sir Terry had "put it out that he had a bad back".
The Game For A Laugh and Going For Gold presenter knew the Wogan family as he had been friends with Sir Terry's younger brother Brian when they were at Belvedere College in Dublin.
"I didn't know he was that seriously ill. I knew he'd been told not to do Children In Need because, as he quipped himself, they don't want an 'oul fella of 77 standing up for ten hours asking for money.
"For so many people in this country, it is going to be like a death in the family - they adored Wogan," he added.
Sir Terry had not been seen in public since November when he pulled out of hosting the annual Children in Need telethon.
Blessed with a warm wit and a surreal sense of humour, Sir Terry was one of the BBC's most beloved broadcasters. His career even included a brief stint in the charts with his 1978 cover of The Floral Dance.
He also provided the UK commentary for the annual Eurovision Song Contest for some 28 years, with many viewing his acerbic comments on the show as the highlight of the event.
From 1972 to 1984 he presented the breakfast show on Radio 2 as The Terry Wogan Show, returning after a decade away in 1993 to front the re-branded Wake Up To Wogan.
The second incarnation of the show regularly drew more than eight million listeners - dubbed TOGs, or "Terry's Old Geezers and Gals".
Tributes poured in as news of his death was revealed on Sunday.
BBC director general Lord Hall said: "He was a lovely, lovely man and our thoughts are with his wife and family.  For 50 years Sir Terry graced our screens and airwaves. His warmth, wit and geniality meant that for millions he was a part of the family."
Radio 2 controller Bob Shennan said he was "one of the greatest and most popular radio hosts this country has ever heard".
Sir Terry began his career on Ireland's national broadcaster RTE as a newsreader and announcer, moving into light entertainment before joining the BBC, where he would stay for the rest of his career.
Radio 2 presenter Simon Mayo described him as a "radio genius", saying: "The staple of all great radio is the friend behind the microphone - and he was the ultimate friend behind the microphone."
Sir Elton John paid tribute to Sir Terry on his Instagram account.
The singer posted a picture of the two of them together, writing: "Such a special and funny man.
"A brilliant broadcaster and presenter. He came to our civil partnership celebration and was a loyal supporter."
Members of Sir Terry's BBC Radio 2 fan club Terry's Old Geezers and Gals (TOGs) have paid tribute to his work and commitment to charity.
Norman Macintosh, who organises the TOGs conventions, told BBC Breakfast: "He was the gentleman and the ultimate broadcaster.
"He talked to one person at a time and he felt like he was talking to you and he brought the whole audience into the show, and everyone felt like they were part of it."
Sir Terry announced his retirement from Wake Up to Wogan in September 2009, making his final regular appearance three months later.
When he broadcast at breakfast for the final time in 2009 he told listeners: "The years together with you have not only been a pleasure but a privilege. You have allowed me to share your lives with you.
"When you tell me how important I have been in your lives it's very moving. You have been every bit as important in mine."
Sir Terry, who continued to front a live Sunday morning show, last appeared on air on Radio 2 on 8 November 2015.
The One Show: A Tribute to Sir Terry will be broadcast at 19:00 GMT on Monday 1 February.

Article: sportscotland says it has yet to decide where the cuts will fall amid concerns that elite athletes could suffer.
The cuts are being blamed on reduced government spending and a drop in National Lottery ticket sales - a major contributor to sports backing.
Governing bodies are bracing themselves for potential job losses.
About 60% of funding is made up from Scottish Government money, with lottery sales making up the rest.
In the year ending 2015, total revenue was £65.1m, which is divided up and awarded to 52 sports.
By the end of next year, that figure will have fallen to £51.8m - a cut to the Scottish sporting budget of 20% in just three years.
sportscotland chairman Mel Young said: "It's heartbreaking to me because I know the effort the sport governing bodies and the community that's around it; the volunteers and the mums and dads.
"And, to have to say that we're having to cut some money back is, I believe, not the right way to go."
Former badminton player Susan Egelstaff, a double bronze medallist at the Commonwealth Games [in 2002 and 2006] and an Olympian, fears the cuts will have "a huge impact".
"What that means in the future is that Scotland will be constantly playing catch-up," she said. "It's almost impossible to catch up if you fall too far behind the leading nations."
The Scottish Government said sport and physical activity play a "key role" in a healthy Scotland and that "significant" investment would continue in those areas.
"Having successfully delivered the Commonwealth Games [in 2014] we are now focusing on protecting or raising investment in areas intended to decrease health inequality and improve life chances, and the small reduction in the sport budget allows us to support those priorities," Minister for Sport Aileen Campbell said.
"There is on-going support for active lifestyles through capital investment in cycling and walking, and over the last 10 years we have invested £168m in sport infrastructure - from grassroots to the elite performance which has increased the facilities and opportunities to get people active and achieve on the world stage at both the Olympics and Commonwealth Games."

Sport funding in Scotland is facing a 20% reduction over a three-year period, a move described as "heartbreaking" by the national agency.

Article: Unions at BAE Systems have warned of possible delays to funding for the Royal Navy's new frigates.
But Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson insisted there was no change to the timetable.
Labour said it was vital that promises were kept while the Lib Dems called for an end to uncertainty.
The UK government confirmed in its Strategic Defence and Security Review last November that eight Type 26 frigates would be built on the Clyde, although the total number was scaled back from 13.
In the meantime, the yards are being sustained by Ministry of Defence orders for new offshore patrol vessels.
But after briefings with management, the GMB union said last week that work on the new frigates would not begin until 2017 and raised concerns that up to 800 jobs could be lost if there was any backsliding on commitments.
SNP leader and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was "gravely concerned" by the developments.
She said: "The future of both Govan and Scotstoun depend on these orders. Solemn promises were made in the run-up to the referendum and if those promises are broken, it will be seriously damaging for the shipyards but I think people across Scotland will feel very let down by the parties that made those promises."
She added: "I think the government has the responsibility to make cast iron assurances here."
Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale said she had held discussions with shipyard workers and BAE management  about the need to protect jobs.
She said: "It's my deep regret that Labour didn't win the general election - so the Tories have to fulfil their promise to the workers in the yards, and I'll be making that case every step of the way."
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie also expressed frustration about the uncertainty.
"There are serious concerns about the future of orders at the yards and it's important that the Conservative government gives an absolute commitment. We've got to end this feast and famine of orders at the yards," he said.
The Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, however, said she had been given assurances by Defence Secretary Michael Fallon that nothing had changed.
She said: "He confirmed there had been no change to the orders that were set out in the Strategic Defence and Security Review last year.
"That means all eight Type 26 anti-submarine frigates that are coming, plus the light frigate order on top of that, and the two offshore patrol vessels. They are coming to the Clyde, as discussed last year, to the same timetable and the same number."
A spokesperson for BAE Systems said: "Following the Strategic Defence and Security Review, we are working with the Ministry of Defence to agree a revised baseline for the Type 26 ships and a production schedule for the two additional offshore patrol vessels in Glasgow.
"We are engaging our trades unions as we work through this process. Our focus is to deliver the capability the Royal Navy needs, while ensuring the best value for UK taxpayers."

Article: Immigration, healthcare and outreach to Latino voters dominated the debate, which disintegrated into long periods of shouting and personal insults.
Mr Trump has won three of the first four contests held so far.
Next week's vote in 11 states is held on what is known as Super Tuesday.
The three men are seeking to be named as the Republican candidate in November's presidential election.
At long last the Republican candidates have come to the realisation that Donald Trump can actually win this race, but it may be too late.
For more than two hours, Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz took turns throwing punches at the New Yorker. They attacked him on his business record; they mentioned hypocrisy; they questioned his conservative credentials; and they criticised the lack of detail in his policies and his reliance on bluster.
"We're having a lot of fun up here, aren't we?" the front-runner quipped at one point. But the truth is that Mr Trump was on his heels for much of the evening.
The challenge for the men who would unseat the leader, however, is that the best time to bludgeon a candidate is before it is clear circumstances are forcing you to act. In a campaign where authenticity is worshipped above all, Thursday's fireworks could smack of the kind of political expediency many associate with traditional politicians.
Both Mr Cruz and Mr Rubio drew blood with their attacks but Mr Trump will be likely to emerge unbowed.

The Republicans who hate Trump - Lifelong members of the party speak out
Mr Rubio, who has come second in several recent contests, mounted a series of attacks on Mr Trump.
"If he hadn't inherited $200m, you know where Donald Trump would be?" Mr Rubio said in one tense exchange. "Selling watches in Manhattan."
Mr Rubio also criticised Mr Trump's failed online education venture, Trump University, and assailed him for hiring foreign workers rather than Americans in his construction projects.
Mr Trump shot back: "I hired tens of thousands of people. You've hired nobody."
The billionaire real estate mogul found himself increasingly on the defensive about his business dealings and his conservative credentials.
In other exchanges
The fruit salad of their life is what I will look at.
Trump on Rubio: "This guy's a choke artist [not able to deliver on stage]."
Rubio to Trump: "You're a lousy businessman."
"If he hadn't inherited $200m, you know where Donald Trump would be right now, selling watches in Manhattan."
Trump to Cruz: "This guy is a liar."
Cruz response: "Falsely accusing someone of lying is itself a lie, and it's something Donald does daily."
Trump to Cruz: "You get along with nobody. You don't have one Republican senator backing you. Not oneâ€¦You should be ashamed of yourself."
"I know you're embarrassed."
Rubio to Trump: "You're the only person on this stage that's ever been fined for hiring people to work on your projects illegally."
Trump response: "I'm the only one on the stage that's hired people. I've hired tens of thousands of people over my job. You've hired nobody. You've had nothing but problems with your credit cards."
Mr Trump has been extremely popular despite his controversial comments about deporting millions of undocumented workers and banning Muslims from travelling to the US.
He is currently leading in 10 out of 11 states holding contests on Super Tuesday when a quarter of the total numbers of delegates needed to secure the Republican nomination will be up for grabs.
He has 82 Republican party delegates, Mr Cruz has 17 and Mr Rubio has 16. To become the Republican party's nominee, a candidate has to have 1,237 total state delegates.
On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders will compete for 1,004 delegates on Super Tuesday.
Mrs Clinton has a clear lead with 505 delegates, but the majority are super delegates who can change their mind during the course of the campaign. Mr Sanders has secured 71 delegates in the first three races.

Article: The Joiners Arms, in Hackney Road, east London, shut in 2015.
Regal Homes, which wants to build nine flats on the site, incorporating a bar, has agreed to the planning condition, believed to be the first of its kind.
Tower Hamlets Council imposed the condition after the area lost 73% of its LGBT venues since 2006.
The Joiners Arms originally opened as an LGBT venue in 1997 and included fashion designer Alexander McQueen among its customers.
Regal Homes, which bought the site in 2014 - a year before the pub closed - has said it will give an LGBT operator first refusal on a 12-year lease for a new bar.
It added the redevelopment was expected to create 1,073 jobs.
The council has been working with Amy LamÃ©, the mayor of London's "Night Czar", on how to bring back a LGBT venue to Hackney Road.
In the application she says protecting LGBT venues is a "key part" of boosting London's "night-time economy".
"They contribute to London's economy, generate stronger and more resilient communities and are vital for many people's freedom of expression," she said.
"London has lost a quarter of its pubs and half of its nightclubs over the last 10 years."
She added a University College of London report showed the capital had lost 58% of its LGBT venues over the past decade, while Tower Hamlets had lost slightly more.
The czar said the report specifically cited the closure of The Joiner's Arms as one of several high-profile LGBT venues to shut in recent years.
The development is expected to be given the go ahead at a meeting of the council's planning committee on Wednesday.
John Biggs, mayor of Tower Hamlets, added: "Tower Hamlets Council is committed to celebrating our great diversity, which includes serving the needs of our LGBT+ community.
"I am delighted that as a council we are leading the way in using innovative ways to protect spaces such as the Joiners Arms site."

Article: Russia's CG effects and the brilliance of Australia's singing were not enough to defeat jazz artist Jamala.
Russia's Sergey Lazarev had been the bookies' top tip for days, possibly because his song was so similar to 2015's Swedish winner - with innovative staging and a slick song to match.
But Ukraine stole past Russia and Australia under the radar, with the new voting system providing a huge surprise at the 11th hour when Jamala was crowned as winner.
She is the first Crimean Tatar to perform at the contest, and her song, 1944, could not have been further from Eurovision's usual fare.
It deals with Stalin, Crimea and claims of ethnic cleansing. Jamala dedicated it to her great-grandmother and her five children, who were deported by Soviet troops from Crimea in 1944.
Simon Bennett, head of the International OGAE Eurovision fan club, told the BBC that former Soviet countries that would "normally vote for Russia" had sent it a message by voting for Ukraine instead.
Political songs are not allowed at Eurovision, but 1944 was permitted because it was based on historic fact, rather than current politics.
BBC Music reporter Mark Savage wrote in February that Ukraine's 2004 Eurovision winner, Ruslana, had said the song 1944 had struck a chord over current circumstances in the region.
"This song... is precisely what we are all suffering in Ukraine today," she said, referencing Russia's seizure of Crimea in 2014.
Jamala simply said after her win: "I want peace and love for everyone," adding at the press conference: "I was sure that if you talk about truth it really can touch people."
But John Kennedy O'Connor, broadcaster, author and Eurovision expert, was not happy with Saturday's result.
"I'm disappointed that a dirge about genocide and delivering a pointed slap in Russia's face has won this year," he told the BBC.
"This contest should never be a political platform and I'm almost angry that it's been turned into one, despite the very clear rule book on the matter."
He said that while third place was an "excellent result", the Russians must be "sick as parrots" at the moment.
Alasdair Rendall, president of the Eurovision fan club OGAE UK, said immediate reaction to Jamala's victory was "mixed".
"Many people admired her strong voice and the impressive visuals on show," he told the BBC.
"However many are already saying it won due to the strong political message it carried rather than its musical quality."
As for Australia, Bennett said it was "neutral and easy to give your votes to" while O'Connor said it was "time for them to go away and start AsiaVision now", referring to a song contest for Asia Pacific countries.
And at the other end of the leaderboard, hopes for the UK's Joe and Jake were dashed when they came third from bottom.
Rendall felt the result was "totally undeserved" and Bennett was "distraught for them".
But O'Connor added: "The fact that their single is not in the UK top 100 after a month [plus] since its release says it all really."
Joe and Jake told the BBC they had given "it their all" and sent "huge congratulations" to Jamala.
The new voting system also got a mixed reception, with Bennett saying it was "a disaster that destroyed the atmosphere"' while Rendall said it had "really ramped up the tension".
It seems that the only thing everyone agreed on was the show itself.
"Congratulations to Swedish TV for putting on one of the most impressive, exciting and high quality Eurovisions ever," said Rendall.

Article: The patrols at Camber Sands in East Sussex will be funded with Â£51,000 allocated by Rother District Council as part of its annual budget.

Families of the men who drowned said a lifeguard service could have saved their lives.
Five men died during a day-trip to the beach last August.  A month earlier, two others also lost their lives.
The council said the beach attracted more than one million people each year.
It said lifeguards would be present from the late May bank holiday until the end of the summer holidays "to offer reassurance" to visitors.
Speaking after a council meeting on Monday night, Mrs Hart, the cabinet member for tourism, said: "Our thoughts remain with the families of those who lost their lives.
"The incidents were significant and unprecedented and we need to react to the changing circumstances.
"We not only need to protect the visiting public, but also the economy and livelihoods of our coastal tourism businesses."
However, she stressed the importance of "people from all communities across Britain being better informed" on beach and water safety before they visit.
She said: "[The beach] can never be completely risk-free but we are committed to investing in our beach patrol, the lifeguard service and working with other agencies to ensure visitors to the beach are aware of the dangers of the sea."
Full inquests into the deaths are awaited. The council said it would act on any recommendations the coroner might make.

Article: Michael Gove said his decision to defy his friend and ally the prime minister and back the leave campaign was the most difficult of his career.
But he said the EU had "proved a failure on so many fronts" and he felt compelled to put his political convictions before loyalty to the PM.
He is the most high-profile minister to declare for out so far.
Four other cabinet ministers - Iain Duncan Smith, Chris Grayling, John Whittingdale and Theresa Villiers - have signed up to the Leave campaign.
Home Secretary Theresa May - who out campaigners had hoped would join their cause - has backed the campaign to remain in the EU.
In a lengthy statement on his reasons for joining the leave campaign, Mr Gove said: "I believe our country would be freer, fairer and better off outside the EU. And if, at this moment of decision, I didn't say what I believe, I would not be true to my convictions or my country.
"By leaving the EU we can take control. Indeed, we can show the rest of Europe the way to flourish.
"Instead of grumbling and complaining about the things we can't change and growing resentful and bitter, we can shape an optimistic, forward-looking and genuinely internationalist alternative to the path the EU is going down."
He said he had wrestled for weeks "with the most difficult decision of my political life".
"I was encouraged to stand for Parliament by David Cameron and he has given me the opportunity to serve in what I believe is a great, reforming government.
"I think he is an outstanding prime minister. There is, as far as I can see, only one significant issue on which we have differed. And that is the future of the UK in the European Union.
"It pains me to have to disagree with the prime minister on any issue. My instinct is to support him through good times and bad.
"But I cannot duck the choice which the prime minister has given every one of us."
Mr Gove said it was "hard to overstate the degree to which the EU is a constraint on ministers' ability to do the things they were elected to do, or to use their judgment about the right course of action for the people of this country".
Addressing claims by Mrs May and the prime minister that remaining in the EU was the best option for Britain's future security, he said: "Far from providing security in an uncertain world, the EU's policies have become a source of instability and insecurity."
Mr Cameron has warned that leaving the European Union would be a "leap in the dark", as he urged voters to back his reform deal.
The PM said: "Those who want to leave Europe cannot tell you if British businesses would be able to access Europe's free trade single market, or if working people's jobs are safe, or how much prices would rise. All they're offering is a risk at a time of uncertainty - a leap in the dark."
Mr Gove's decision was welcomed by out campaigners, with UKIP MEP Roger Helmer tweeting: "Seems that Michael Gove will campaign for #Brexit. Well done that man. Courageous and principled."
There has been increasing speculation in recent days that Mr Gove would argue for an EU exit, with some commentators suggesting he would not lead the campaign.
Leave campaigners have been pinning their hopes on landing a big name to go up against Mr Cameron - with London Mayor Boris Johnson, who is yet to reveal which side he will back,  still their top target.

Osman says the loss of Archibald - who guided Thistle to a top six finish last season - would be a hard act to follow.
"Since I signed, he's only got better, every season. It's no surprise teams are interested in him," Osman said.

The boys love him. We just pray he stays here for another season."
Osman's Partick Thistle team-mate Adam Barton echoes his captain's sentiments.
"I would be personally disappointed because what he has done is really good," the midfielder said.
"As a footballer, you like managers who really stick by their players. You come across so many managers who chop and change things and I have been through that many managers that many times.
"New managers come in and they don't even want to see you play, they just want to bring their own players in and chop and change. To see him go would not be a good thing."

Article: A recent programme in Algeria earned fierce criticism for fooling a renowned communist novelist into believing he had been arrested for "atheism and espionage".
During the segment, 75-year-old Rachid Boudjedra was forced by fake police officers to repeat the Islamic proclamation "God is Greatest" and utter the two Islamic testimonies of faith.
The programme, called We Got You was later suspended amid a wave of criticism from civil society.
TV has become an important part of the Islamic holy month, and broadcasters will often commission special programmes to draw audiences in as they break their fast in the evening.
Prank TV shows have risen in popularity, but have also earned criticism in recent years for taking things too far.
Egyptian actor Ramez Galal has established himself as a major TV prankster, with a series of programmes featuring celebrities in increasingly extreme scenarios.
In one edition, he fooled celebrities into believing they were on a sinking ship, surrounded by floating body parts and an approaching shark.
In another, victims were locked inside a supposed ancient Egyptian tomb containing bats, insects and a mummy rising from the dead.
In 2013 during a programme entitled Ramez, the Fox of the Desert, guest celebrities were fooled into believing the bus they were travelling on had been intercepted by militants.
The mock militants pretended to shoot the driver dead and then blindfolded and handcuffed the guests.
This was aired at a time when Egypt was witnessing a surge in terror attacks, particularly in the region of Sinai, where military convoys were often attacked by armed bandits in desolate areas.
Galal revels in the controversy. In a trailer for his show, he admits to "torturing his friends and fellow actors because he loves them".
And it may be that only the audience is being fooled. Sharp-eyed viewers often find clues signalling that the guests are in on the prank.
Some celebrities have confirmed that this was the case.
Tunisia's The Earthquake is another controversial programme which fools guests into believing they are experiencing a violent tremor.
In one episode, an elderly religious leader insisted on continuing to pray despite the ongoing quake.
The show was widely criticised on social media for disregarding the age and health conditions of the guests, who seemed genuinely scared.
Similar charges were levelled at Algeria's We Got You. Following the episode featuring Mr Boudjedra, one Algerian novelist said it was "unbelievable that a famous writer was ridiculously pranked with no regards to his age or fame".
Religious bodies in the region have recently issued fatwas (religious edicts) asserting that terrorising people for any purpose is religiously forbidden.
The shows are also criticised, like the slew of entertainment programmes aired during Ramadan, for being a distraction from spiritual dedication during the holy month.
Egyptian media expert Yasser Abd-al-Aziz told the BBC that the prevalence of TV pranks has forced production companies to push the boundaries of good taste in order to attract audience and advertising revenue.
But one popular show entitled The Shock appears to buck this trend, with more traditional pranks, rather than terrifying ordeals.
The show is filmed in a number of Arab countries, capturing reactions to staged situations such as a man violently scolding his wife, a student insulting his teacher or a child standing helpless in the cold weather asking passers-by for a coat.
It has won over audiences across the the region by exploring how strangers interact in dramatic but everyday situations.
As Twitter user @Nooruldeen89 put it: "Despite the acts being staged, The Shock awakens the human in you and makes you rethink your perspective."

"These are very difficult times for the relatives and loved ones of the persons arrested, as the decision to leave the country was not that of the family, but of a single family member," the statement said.
"As a result, family members often find themselves at a complete loss and unable to understand the decision made by the youth."
Police said they could not disclose the identity of the suspects or provide information about what led to their arrests.

Article: The incident began on Tuesday morning when border agents encountered two men carrying backpacks five miles (8km) east of Sumas, Washington, in the US.
Authorities say agents interrupted an attempt to smuggle a load of MDMA, or ecstasy, from Canada to San Francisco.
Two others were arrested and accused of planning to transport the drugs.
On Tuesday morning, US border agents ordered the two men they encountered near the border to halt, officials said.
One of the men dropped his backpack, fired a weapon at the agents, and ran, according to a criminal complaint filed in US federal court in Washington on Wednesday.
The officers took the other man, identified as Jeffrey Laviolette, into custody immediately.
Canadian and US police searched for the fugitive on foot and by helicopter, putting up road blocks.
Nathan Hall, a Canadian citizen, was arrested by the Abbotsford Police Department in British Columbia early on Wednesday morning.
According to border patrol agents, the backpacks Mr Hall and Mr Laviolette were carrying contained a total of 58lb (26kg) of ecstasy.
Also inside one backpack was a California driver's licence with the name of William Nickerson but a picture of Nathan Hall, the complaint alleges.
Investigators later arrested a Bellingham, Washington woman, Kali Henifin, who they say planned to pick the two men up at the border. They also arrested her boyfriend, Ryan Lambert, who allegedly told officers he was to be paid $11,000 (Â£7,270) to drive the drugs to San Francisco.
Ms Henifin told agents they had been monitoring police radio communication on a mobile phone when they heard a report of a shooting and left the area, according to the complaint.
The three defendants in US custody face conspiracy as well as drug possession and distribution charges.
The wooded area a few miles east of a highway border crossing is a well-known smuggling route for drugs and firearms, and a spokeswoman for the US attorney for the Western District of Washington told the BBC smuggling prosecutions are "a large part of our practice".

With darkness falling, and your parents calling you in for tea, you squeeze in one last penalty to win the FA Cup, one last drop-kick to win the Rugby World Cup, one last putt to win The Masters.
Two Yorkshiremen had those same moments growing up around Sheffield in the early part of the century. This time last year, they made one a reality.
Danny Willett may have hit the drives and holed the putts that made him the first Englishman since Nick Faldo in 1996 to win the Masters and don the famous Green Jacket, but his caddie Jonathan Smart is claiming a bit of the credit.
In a documentary - When Danny Won The Masters, to be shown on BBC Two at 15:00 BST on Sunday, 2 April - the friends share their memories of an unforgettable Sunday afternoon playing the back nine at Augusta National.
Willett, playing with fellow Englishman and friend Lee Westwood, began the final round three shots adrift of defending champion Jordan Spieth, who was four groups behind him on the course.
The 29-year-old, who was only playing in the tournament because his son Zachariah was born a week early, takes up the tale on the 10th tee...
Danny: We were two under through the first nine but we were still three shots behind Jordan.
Jonny: We made an unbelievable par save on the ninth; it was the smelliest nine-footer down the hill and it kept us going. Then we had our funniest moment of the week walking down the 10th fairway. Danny said: "We're in contention on Sunday at the Masters." We were like little kids. We were laughing, not in disbelief, but at realising the situation we were in.
Danny: I hit two lovely shots on 10 and made par.
Danny: Everyone knows how difficult 11, 12 and 13 are with the wind swirling between the trees. I hit two lovely shots on 11 and made par, found the front edge on the par-three 12th and made par. We stepped on to the 13th tee and Jordan had birdied the eighth and ninth and stretched out to a five-shot lead.
The tee shot on the par-five 13th is really difficult for me because I hit a fade and it needs a draw. We hit three wood all week and almost played it as a three-shotter, but on Sunday Jonny and I said, 'If we're going to do anything we need to try and force it a little bit'. So I stepped up and gunned it. A little five-yard draw with the driver round the corner.
Jonny: Dan is adamant that was his best shot of the week.
Danny: I then hit five iron to the middle of the green and had a two-putt birdie but while I was doing that, Jordan had bogeyed 10.
Danny: I hit a nice drive down the right on 14 and a wedge to four feet and made birdie again. Jordan bogeyed 11.
Jonny: It was a four-footer that was straight downhill but I wasn't sure if it was going to break, it wasn't obvious. Nothing is said, we both know we've got to keep pushing. Those two holes were massive for us.
Willett improves to -4, Spieth drops to -5
Danny: The next time we see the leaderboard, Lee Westwood has just chipped in for eagle from the back of the 15th green to get within one of us.
Jonny: Everything went ballistic. We had another birdie chance but that shot from Westy brought another player into it. I had goosebumps because the fans on the 16th can also see everything and the sound was ridiculous.
Danny: I had a 10-12-footer from the back edge. I thought that was to tie the lead. I missed it but tapped in for par. John put the flag in, walked back, said 'that was a good effort' and then we heard all the oohs and aahs from the gallery.
Media playback is not supported on this device
Jonny: I'll never forget walking to the 16th tee. I saw people in the gallery putting their head in their hands and we turned around and saw they were changing the big scoreboard.
Danny: It's just off the back right of 15 and Jordan had gone from five under to one under on the par-three 12th and we were at four under. So we looked at each other and waited for them to change the score because we thought they've got it wrong. After five or 10 steps, we realised we were at four, Westwood at three and Jordan at one.
Jonny: That's when things got a little bit more interesting.
Danny: I'd been dying for the bathroom so I ran down past the 16th tee and everyone's saying 'look at the leaderboard, you're leading the Masters'. I'm in the bathroom and my hands are shaking and I'm nervous but thinking 'this is what you practise for'.
I kept telling myself, five good swings, see if you can hole a couple of putts and we'll see what happens. When I came out, I was in the best frame of mind I'd been in for a long time. Mentally I was seeing everything as it happened and I wasn't getting too far ahead.
Jonny: There was no discussion. If we acknowledge the position we're in, we're admitting we're nervous, so how is that going to help? We stick to our routine. We had 181 yards to the flag. An eight iron. We created a picture, just like we do on every shot.
Media playback is not supported on this device
Danny: I hit a lovely eight iron to about 10 feet.
Jonny: I walked off ahead as soon as he hit it. I'm pretty excitable and I didn't want him to see any emotion I'm giving off. Walking to the green there was no discussion. Everyone's telling Danny 'this is yours' but he probably didn't hear any of it. He was ridiculously focused.
Danny: We rolled in our birdie putt.
Jonny: The putt on 16 was all him. When he has a good line, why would he call me in? It only creates doubt.
Danny: Westy hit it to 35 feet and three-whacked, so all of a sudden we've opened a bit more of a gap. In the past 45 minutes, we'd gone from five behind to two in front. It was bonkers.
Jonny: On the 17th tee, I consciously said to Dan that these guys behind us are good and capable of making four birdies in a row.
Danny: I hit not a bad tee shot but was a bit hindered by a tree for the second and I hit eight iron long left. Looking back, I left myself a really tricky chip.
Jonny: I was thinking 'there's loads of green to work with' and it was a bog-standard chip shot. It got to the top of the hill and I thought 'he's not hit that hard enough' but it rolled over and then I thought 'that's quick' but it finished stiff and I thought that wasn't an easy chip shot!
Danny: I chipped it pretty much stone dead, which, round Augusta, you don't do. I'm going to go back this year and put a ball down and just see how difficult it is.
Danny: We'd hit a little cut driver off the 18th tee all week but we were pretty pumped with adrenaline and Jonny called three wood.
Jonny: My book said 296 yards to reach the bunker, so it's not hard to hit a good drive straight into it. He's got a low ball flight so he couldn't have done what Sandy Lyle did out of that bunker and reach the green.
Danny: He said: 'You can hit three wood as good as you like and you're never ever going to reach those bunkers.'
Jonny: Everyone was hustling to get a place to stand.
Danny: There was a lot of commotion. I stepped off the tee twice because people are moving up the sides, through the leaves, through the trees.
Jonny: That tee shot to me looks like hitting down a hotel corridor and I'm thinking it's getting narrower. Third time he's pulled the trigger.
Danny: I hit it 295 yards, straight down the middle of the fairway. Again, the hands were shaking, everything was shaking, but the walk up to the second shot was pretty enjoyable.
Jonny: There's a dip down before you walk up the hill to the green. As we got to the bottom, he took a massive deep breath. I knew he was nervous so I just said to him: 'You don't need to take that deep a breath, it's not that big a hill.'
Danny: I'd done 80% of the job I told myself I had to do - to make five good swings. One more to go. I think we had 183 yards, Jonny will still know. Can't miss the green left, can't miss it short, can't miss it long. I've seen it millions of times on the television, where it's impossible to get up and down from, and where you can give yourself a bit more margin. I pushed the seven iron a bit but it pitched on the collar of the green and worked off the bank back down exactly as I'd seen it before.
Jonny: The walk up to the green was an unbelievable experience. We were having a little giggle to ourselves, saying 'this is pretty cool'. I wish I'd taken it in more.
Danny: It was almost job done. We've got a 13-footer to get to six under, which I thought would be a difficult number for anyone to get to. But we get up on the green and look at the putt and you think it would be nice to get to six but I don't want to drop to four. So I cosied it down there and tapped in for par.
Jonny: The walk from the green to the clubhouse was bonkers. It was bizarre, surreal. It's stuff you watch on television and don't do yourself. We're walking off 18 and half-thinking we've won the Masters.
Danny: My father-in-law was at the back of the green, giving me a hug. You walk up to the cabin, sign your card [a bogey-free five-under-par 67], making sure you've got all that right and then it's a waiting game. We had 45, 50 minutes of waiting.
Jonny: I didn't know what to do with myself. I was half-watching, half-wondering if we should go the practice range in case there's a play-off.
Danny: We sat outside the recorders' hut and I'm trying to call [wife] Nic. The signal's not great, I'm just trying to get through to her. And I'm texting my mum and dad and brothers. But I'm constantly looking at the television to see what Jordan does.
Spieth birdies the par-five 15th to go three under with three to play.
Danny: You're going over all the scenarios where you can get beat. And then he made bogey on 17. He dropped back to two under and it's a physical impossibility to tie.
Jonny: I didn't realise the cameras were there and I just jumped on him.
Danny: I was on the phone to Nic, and Jonny jumped on me on the sofa. Everyone's seen that on the TV. That was the moment you realise that's what you've worked for and what you've just achieved. It isn't a dream. It's come true.
Danny: Every major trophy is significant in its own way but the Green Jacket is special. It's having your locker in the champions' locker room. It's your jacket being in there for the rest of your life. It's being able to go back to Augusta forever, until you don't want to play any more. The ceremony in Butler Cabin. You don't get to go inside the places I got to see at Augusta unless you win at Augusta. I'm honoured to be part of that now.
Jonny: We were whisked round the back of the clubhouse to Butler Cabin. That was cool. You've watched it on TV and then we're doing it. Dan's putting a Green Jacket on. I remember them fitting it because they've got them all lined up. Before he went in the room he looked across at me, just laughing. It was nuts. We've all had putts as juniors to win the Masters. I always dreamt about doing it but it was mega to be as close as I was to it and have some sort of contribution to Dan winning it.
Danny: When you walk through the door at home, you're not Masters champion any more. You're dad, or Dan. You're straight back to changing nappies and you take the jacket off so you don't get anything on it. The only time I've watched it back was that evening. I opened a beer and sat on the sofa with Nic. Watched it for an hour and a half. Highlights of what we'd done two days before. Just a crazy old few days really.

Article: An independent report commissioned by the Department of Health estimated these groups cost the NHS £2bn a year.
Ministers said some of that spending was unavoidable, but said it would be realistic to save a quarter.
Savings would come from deterring so-called health tourism, recovering money owed by other countries and a levy on non-European temporary residents.
One senior doctor questioned the government's figures and said doctors should not have to spend time "vetting eligibility" of patients.
Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he did not want to "turn GPs into border guards" and no-one would be denied emergency treatment, but foreign visitors must make a "fair contribution".
Mr Hunt said he recognised the NHS's duty of care must "transcend" financial concerns, but collecting an extra £500m a year could pay for 4,000 extra doctors.
"We have one of the most generous systems in the world when it comes to healthcare for foreign visitors, but it's time for action to ensure the NHS is a national health service - not an international one," he added.
By Nick TriggleHealth correspondent
The issue of which foreigners are entitled to treatment and which are not is complex.
The first thing to say is if someone needs emergency care - for example if they have an accident - the NHS will treat them no matter where they come from.
Another exemption is if someone has an infectious disease as treatment helps protect the wider public.
Beyond that the UK has reciprocal agreements with most European countries and 28 other nations, including countries such as Canada and Australia.
It means if their residents need care while here temporarily - either on holiday or working - they will be seen and the NHS will then reclaim the cost of that care from the other country.
The research released by the Department of Health shows the NHS is not very good at clawing that money back. This is because of a perverse incentive in the system which ministers now want to rectify.
Meanwhile, travelling to the UK deliberately for health treatment - so-called health tourism - is not allowed.
The rules are less clear in other cases, such as expats and asylum seekers.
The latest research is published in two separate reports by firms Prederi and Creative Research.
The government has been criticised for using financial estimates from the Prederi report, but Mr Hunt said it was the "most thorough research there has ever been" in this area.
The report itself notes that it is based on "incomplete data, sometimes of varying quality, and a large number of assumptions", but it says the estimates are the "best that can be made at present", and Mr Hunt said researchers had been "completely honest about what they do know and what they don't know".
The government is currently consulting on the measures it will take to tackle this issue.
It has already announced a £200-a-year levy on migrants from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) staying for between six months and five years, and Mr Hunt said this could raise £200m a year.
A cost-recovery unit will also be set up to help hospitals claw back money they are owed by other governments for treating foreign nationals visiting the UK.
Meanwhile, "deliberate health tourism" - whereby people travel to the UK to get NHS care - is estimated by Prederi to cost between £60m and £80m a year. The report's authors concede this figure is "uncertain" and the "plausible range" of the cost is £20m-£100m.
Frequent visitors "taking advantage" by registering with GPs and getting access to prescriptions and some hospital referrals cost the NHS a further £50m-£200m a year, the report adds.
The government accepts it cannot recoup all of this money and entirely stop health tourism and so it has put forward the "conservative" £500m figure.
To achieve this, it said a better system of identifying when visitors and migrants got treatment was needed. More details on what this will involve will be revealed in the coming weeks.
Free NHS care is offered to anyone with living in the UK who has temporary or permanent permission to do so.
Asylum seekers, non-EEA nationals who do not have permission to live in the UK, British ex-pats and visitors usually have to pay for treatment.
The UK has reciprocal agreements with most European nations and 28 other countries, and under these visitors are given free NHS care.
The NHS should claim these costs back from the relevant governments - but the research suggests just £73m a year is recouped out of more than £460m at present.
This is because there is a perverse incentive in the system whereby if they declare the fact they have treated a foreign national it is up to the individual hospital to chase up the home nation for the money whereas if they do not declare it they get money from the NHS system for seeing a patient entitled to care.
Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: "We are not against improving the recovery of costs from people with no entitlement to NHS treatment."
But he added the figures were based on a "large number of assumptions" and was more about "spin than substance".
Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the British Medical Association's GPs committee, said the government's £500m savings figure was "exaggerated", partly because it did not take account of the costs of implementing its plans.
He said migrants paying the proposed £200-a-year levy could be more likely to use the NHS to "get their money's worth", and he said the cost of a single hospital outpatient appointment would be more than £200.
Dr Nagpaul said doctors should not be distracted from their work in order to check the eligibility of patients for treatments.
Dr Clare Gerada, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, said it was imperative GPs were not tasked with being a "new border agency" in policing the NHS.
"The risks to public health that will arise from these proposals are also very real. They will deter people from seeking medical help in the early stages of illness when they can be dealt with cost-effectively and efficiently in primary care, rather than requiring expensive specialist care and increasing admissions to emergency departments," she said.
Jonathan Portes, of the Institute of Economic and Social Research think tank, said the research revealed the extent of deliberate health tourism had been "hugely overstated" and was in fact a "very small part of NHS expenditure".

Article: But with no private company yet to get a craft with passengers onboard into orbit, or even sub-orbit, how can you best endeavour to lead an industry that is still very much in an embryonic state?
Final Frontier's cramped headquarters are testament to the very early stage of its business sector.
It is based in a tiny studio in Brooklyn Navy Yard that can barely fit co-founders Ted Southern and Nikolay Moiseev, two assistants, and a few tables.
Bits of fabric and plastic tubing litter almost every available surface.
However, humble surroundings have not stopped the company from dreaming big about the future possibilities - and profits - of commercial space travel, which has already seen more than $1.4bn (Â£900m) of investment from companies including Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic.
And that figure is expected to more than double over the next 10 years as commercial space tourism is set to become a reality.
Mr Moiseev, a former space suit designer for Zvezda, Russia's national space suit supplier, left his home country to strike out in the US.
He has tried on and tested almost every space suit ever designed, and was responsible for designing the suits worn by cosmonauts on Mir, the former Russian space station, and the crew of the current International Space Station.
But Mr Moiseev thinks that those designs are nothing compared with what lies ahead.
"In the near future a lot of people - tourists - any age, with different health conditions, will fly in space," he says.
"And the high operation pressure is a challenge for the space suit designer."
This is the issue that Final Frontier says it is hoping to solve: how to design a space suit, not for an astronaut, but for a normal person who just happens to be headed to outer space.
Mr Southern says: "Spaceflight is notoriously uncomfortable - tight, hot - and sometimes the spacesuits just make it worse.
"When they're pressurised they're hard to move, you need special liquid cooling garments generally for space suits, and they cost hundreds of thousands of dollars," says Mr Southern.
"So that's what we're trying to overcome here, we're going for a suit that's lightweight, inexpensive, safe and also more comfortable than traditionally military style spacesuits."
But first there's the small matter of money.
Mr Southern says: "A lot of rocket companies that are coming online now are hoping to fly 2014, 2015, 2016 - years out.
"So it's been a challenge for that reason finding funding, finding partners, and finding customers."
Although the pair first started dreaming and designing in 2007, after meeting at a Nasa-sponsored astronaut glove design competition (which they later placed at in 2009), they did not set up Final Frontier until 2010.
At first, Mr Southern poured in his extra earnings from his day job as a costume designer for Broadway shows and circus firm Cirque de Soleil, into the business.
"People always raise an eyebrow - 'Wow that's so different - props and costumes and spacesuits'," says Mr Southern with a smile.
"In fact I see a full continuum there. Failure was not an option on Broadway either."
Contracts with Nasa - to design radiation coating for fabrics and bits of space suits, including a pressurised elbow-and-shoulder assembly - provided Final Frontier with funding.
As did an agreement with zero2infinity, a Spanish company interested in exploring suborbital trips.
But in addition to traditional means, in June 2012 Final Frontier Design turned to crowd-funding website Kickstarter.
Using the $27,632 they raised on the site, they were able to build the "3G" suit, which is the third version of their lightweight space suit.
Meant to be worn inside the space capsule in case of a loss of pressure, it was unveiled this summer.
Funding is not the only challenge: Final Frontier must also deal with competitors.
There are the established space suit manufacturers, like David Clark and Boeing, who have a long history of providing suits for Nasa.
Then, there are rival start-ups like Orbital Outfitters, which like Final Frontier features a founding team that includes space outsiders, such as a former Hollywood special effects artist.
Finally, there are the in-house space suit design centres at a number of the commercial space tourism companies, such as SpaceX, which is led by Elon Musk, the founder of PayPal.
Peter Homer, a private astronaut glove developer who started his own firm, Flagsuit (tagline: "Fits like a glove"), says there's more than enough room for everyone.
"Right now, there's not a lot of competition because there's no market," says Mr Homer, who is also collaborating with Orbital Outfitters. Mr Homer won the Nasa glove competition in 2007 and 2009.
"It's about trying to keep going and trying to keep moving the technology forward. I and others are kind of waiting for the customers to be ready for their space suits."
So Mr Southern and Mr Moiseev continue to wait, and build.
They've hired interns for the summer, who are busy testing various suit fabrics and gloves.
For Mr Southern and Mr Moiseev, their unlikely partnership and even more implausible business quest, is not just about a business opportunity but also about the way they see the future.
"I see it as inevitable that the human race will expand beyond the surface of the Earth, it's unfortunately finite limited surface area here," says Mr Southern.
"I think it's pretty critical that we survive in these challenging environments."

Article: Officers raided a workshop in the port of Izmir, where they say they found life jackets stuffed with packaging rather than buoyancy aids.
The four workers making the jackets included two young Syrian girls.
On Tuesday, the bodies of 34 migrants were found along Turkey's coast. Many were wearing life jackets.
Several children were among the dead.
More than one million migrants crossed the Mediterranean in 2015 and the vast majority went from Turkey to Greece.
Many migrants buy life jackets to help them survive the dinghy journey. A properly made jacket costs up to a £100 (€130; $150), reports the BBC's James Reynolds in Istanbul.
But many migrants make do with cheaper, badly made ones, which cost just £10 and may offer no protection whatsoever, our correspondent says.
Izmir: Migrants' life jacket capital
The life jacket'mountains' of Lesbos
Migration to Europe explained in graphics
According to the UN, 3,771 people were listed as dead or missing in 2015.
In Wednesday's raid the authorities seized 1,263 life jackets that failed to correspond to safety standards, Turkey's Dogan news agency said.  The workshop was in the centre of Izmir, a major hub for refugees and migrants.
Four people were found working in the workshop, including two young Syrian girls, the news agency said. It did not publish the girls' ages.
The confiscated life jackets have been sent to the local police for examination and an investigation has been launched.
It comes one day after the bodies of more than 30 migrants were washed up in Turkey. Their boats capsized in bad weather on the way to the Greek island of Lesbos, the authorities say.
Turkish media published harrowing images of the corpses, many still wearing life jackets that had apparently been of no use.
Migrants are continuing to arrive on the Greek islands every day, despite the wintry weather. Lesbos is by far the most popular destination for migrants leaving Turkey. More than 500,000 reached the island in 2015.
Late last year, Turkey reached a deal with the European Union to tighten its borders and reduce the numbers crossing to Greece in return for €3bn (£2.1bn) and political concessions.
A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.

Article: He is one of 249 men suing the Catholic Church over alleged historical sexual abuse at St William's residential school in Market Weighton.
Only one man out of five initial cases heard at the High Court in Leeds has been awarded compensation.
In December, a judge ruled in favour of one claimant and ordered the church to pay Â£14,000 in damages.
At the same hearing, His Honour Judge Gosnell dismissed three other claims.

In January 2016 the former head of St William's James Carragher was jailed for the third time after he was found guilty of sexually abusing boys.
Carragher, 75, had already been sentenced to 21 years in prison for sexually abusing boys and was jailed for a further nine years in January.
He was jailed for seven years in 1993 and a further 14 years in 2004 for offences he committed at St William's, which closed in 1992.
Co-defendant Anthony McCallen, 69, a former chaplain at St William's, was sentenced to 15 years in prison for a series of historical sex offences.
He was acquitted of eight other charges at the same trial.
The De La Salle Brothers, a Christian order of lay teachers, which ran the school in conjunction with the Diocese of Middlesbrough, has apologised "unreservedly" for the abuse.
Another set of compensation claims is expected to be heard in late 2017.

Article: The film, written by JK Rowling and starring Eddie Redmayne as Newt Scamander, took a total of £15.3m.
It is the third highest opening weekend from the JK Rowling series, behind the two final Harry Potter films.
Warner Bros executive Josh Berger said: "We are thrilled with the huge response from British and Irish audiences."
The film also worked its magic at North American cinemas, taking an estimated $75m (£61m) over the weekend - more than the rest of the US box office top 10 combined.
Harry Potter creator Rowling has planned scripts for a total of five films in the series.
The first instalment is set in New York, and tells the story of a fictional author mentioned in the Potter stories.
Redmayne plays the part of the animal-loving magizoologist Newt Scamander, who visits New York's secret community of witches and wizards.
The film is set 70 years before Harry Potter reads his book at his school, Hogwarts.
It has received broadly positive reviews from critics.
The opening weekend haul in the US and Canada was lower than for any of the Harry Potter films, however.
Elsewhere in the box office charts, Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange fell to second with $17.7m (£14.3m), with Trolls third on $17.5m (£14.1m).
Sci-fi movie Arrival, starring Amy Adams, took fourth spot with $11.8m (£9.5m), while the comedy Almost Christmas, starring Danny Glover and Gabrielle Union, rounded out the top five with $7m (£5.7m).

Article: Researchers have found a 90% fall in levels of the human papilloma virus (HPV) in Scottish women since the vaccine was made available in 2008.
HPV virus types are thought to account for about 90% of cervical cancers.
Scientists hope the drop in HPV cases will lead to a significant drop in future cervical cancer cases.
The researchers, led by senior epidemiologist Dr Kevin Pollock at Health Protection Scotland, said they hoped to see a decrease in new diagnoses within a year.
He told BBC Radio Scotland: "The two HPV types we were vaccinating against - HPV 16 and HPV 18 - cause about 70% to 80% of cervical cancers within Scotland but the vaccine has exceeded our expectations because it appears to have knocked out another three high-risk HPV types which cause about 10% of cervical cancers.
"So we do forecast within the next few years a 90% reduction in cervical cancer within Scotland."
Researchers compared the cervical screening and vaccination records of women born in 1995, who had been vaccinated as teenagers, with those from unvaccinated women born between 1989 and 1990.
They found just 0.5% of women from the 1995 group tested positive for the virus, compared with 21.4% of women born before 1990.
The study also showed evidence that the vaccine protected against three other high-risk HPV genotypes involved in the development of cervical cancer.
The research will be presented to the Microbiology Society's annual conference in Edinburgh on Wednesday by Dr Kate Cuschieri, director of the Scottish HPV Reference Lab.
She said: "These new findings indicate that the positive impact of the HPV vaccine may be even greater than we initially thought.
"Collectively, these data demonstrate the significant and continued benefits of the HPV vaccination programme in Scotland, which has achieved a consistent and high uptake of around 90% in 12 to 13-year-old girls."
Dr Pollock added: "The very high uptake of the HPV vaccine is strongly associated with these massive reductions in high-risk HPV types that are known to cause approximately 90% of cervical cancer in Scottish women."
He said the virus was also known to cause a number of other cancers, including vulvovaginal, anal and a subset of head and neck cancers.
"These results suggest that this vaccine will also have a significant impact on these cancers in the years ahead", he said.
The research, which was funded by the Scottish government, looked at samples from more than 20,000 women, making it one of the largest population-based studies on the impact of the vaccine.
There were 388 new cases of cervical cancer in Scotland in 2014.

Article: The 22-year-old fractured her neck and back, dislocated her pelvis and slipped a disc in her neck after colliding with Elis Ligtlee during the omnium final.
Norfolk's Williamson spent four weeks in hospital after January's accident.
"They were pretty sure paralysis was going to be the outcome while I was in Rotterdam, but luckily I pulled through," she told BBC Look East.
"Being an athlete, I think they said because my neck and back were so strong I was able to withstand the force.
"Although I did break a few bones, my spinal cord stayed intact and I'm here to live another day."
Racing at the event was cancelled after the 2013 World Championships bronze medallist's crash, with fans asked to leave the velodrome.
"I have no memories, which is probably pretty good," she said. "It's not going to put me off in the future," she said.
"I remember holding onto the fence getting ready to roll up to the final and then next thing I know I was in hospital and someone was telling me I'd had an accident. I just responded with 'did I win?'. That was all I was worried about."
Williamson hopes to be back "easy riding" on a bike by the end of the summer and says she has the right support around her to make a full recovery.

"I'm going to get back on a bike eventually," she added. "I've got no timescale yet, but I don't know what level I'll be able to get to. I'll give it a good go.

Article: Prof Les Mayhew said the difference between the sexes peaked at nearly six years in the 1970s.
Life expectancy is going up all round, but the rates for men are increasing faster.
Plummeting smoking rates in men are thought to explain a lot of the change.
Prof Mayhew, a professor of statistics at Cass Business School, analysed life expectancy data in England and Wales. He was working out how long 30-year-olds could expect to live.
His findings show men languishing far behind for decades, but now starting to get closer to women. If current trends continue, Prof Mayhew predicts, both sexes could, on average, be living to the age of 87 in 2030.
He said: "What's interesting at the moment is that in the last 20 years or so, male life expectancy at 30 has jumped by about six years and if it jumps by the same amount in the next 20 years it will converge with female life expectancy."
The reason could be down to men living a healthier lifestyle. "One of the main reasons, I think, is the trend in the prevalence of smoking. Smoking took off after 1920 in the male population and at its high about 80% of males smoked.
"This was reflected in more divergence in the life expectancy, so by the time you get to about 1970 it was at its peak - the difference in life expectancy was about 5.7 years."
Other factors are thought to be safer, more office-based, jobs. Millions of men used to work in hazardous occupations such as coal mining. Healthcare has meant more men live longer as well. People with heart disease, which is more common in men, can expect to live much longer than they did a few decades ago.
By contrast, women started smoking later than men.  
, but are falling fast in men.
A boy and a girl born on the same day will still not have the same life expectancies, as the study looked only at people who had already reached 30. Boys are more likely to die in their first year of life and are more likely to take up dangerous sports or be involved in fatal accidents.
It means that women could still have the edge for some time to come.
Prof David Leon, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: "In virtually all countries in the world, women do have a slight advantage."
However, he said the gap was definitely closing in some countries.
Countries with lower levels of life expectancy, such as in sub-Saharan Africa, showed very little difference between the genders. This was due to the prevalence of infectious diseases which "are not picky about men and women", he said.
In countries that had defeated most infectious diseases, such as in Eastern Europe, "there is a much bigger difference, mostly dominated by lifestyle factors".
At one point in the 1990s, the gap between life expectancies in Russia reached 13 years. Prof Leon said it was an "absolutely massive" difference in a "very gendered society".
In his third class of countries, such as the UK, the gap in life expectancies is starting to narrow.
He said: "Men are getting a bit better behaved and women are adopting male life expectancies."

Article: He was seriously injured in a bomb attack in Afghanistan in 2006.
Since carrying the torch on 26 June, Doncaster-based L/Bdr Parkinson has had thousands of requests on Facebook.
But the site limits friend associations to 5,000 per personal page and he cannot accept all the requests.
Flanked by hundreds of people, he walked for nearly half an hour with the Olympic torch with an assistant who supported his arm.
L/Bdr Parkinson's nomination stated: "The brain injury took his speech, but not his personality and sense of humour," adding he now speaks unaided.
It said: "Determined to prove everyone wrong, he fought back every step of the way. Ben's intelligence and wit [are] unchanged. Still the same funny and caring Ben."
He spends 12 hours a day in the gym and rehab and walks with crutches, spending "the rest of his time spent raising money for many military charities and as patron of his beloved  
          Pilgrim Bandits
".
L/Bdr Parkinson's mother Diane said the responses had "been phenomenal" and that Ben was really "buoyed up" by the support and friendship he had been shown.
She said: "It's just unbelievable, Ben's had way over 5,000 friend requests but Facebook won't let him have more than that number.
"Thousands of people have joined the Pilgrim Bandits website and the messages of support we've had are great.
"Ben's page has had 19,000 hits just on an update, I don't understand how these things work, but it's phenomenal."
She said the amount of post the family had received had also increased.
She added: "Some mail has just been addressed to Ben, please Mr Postie.
"E-mail traffic has gone through the roof and Ben's had hundreds of requests to visit places with the [Olympic] torch.
"He's absolutely bouncing and buoyed up and elated."
Facebook would not comment on the issue but their guidance was that if people were receiving this many requests then they have become a public figure, so should consider having a page instead of a profile.
Alternatively, Ben could use subscribe so that people can see his public updates without actually becoming a friend.

Article: Former Association of Police and Crime Commissioners (APCC) chief executive Nazir Afzal was advised against doing so by the organisation's board.
This was because of potentially controversial policing issues that could have been raised on the show.
But Mr Afzal stepped down and appeared on the programme on 25 May.
The APCC said: "Nazir told the board that he intended to go on Question Time to discuss the recent events in Manchester.
"The board, made up of all parties, advised that it would be inappropriate for him to do so, given the number of contentious issues relating to policing which could be raised especially in discussion with politicians who were appearing and during purdah.
"He resigned from his post in order to make this appearance. We thank him for his service during his year at the APCC."
Mr Afzal joined the APCC last year.
The association said Mr Afzal signed a contract confirming that he would not do any media without the consent of the board.
This was essential because the APCC was apolitical and the role of the chief executive was politically restricted, it said.
Mr Afzal tweeted: "Given media calls I confirm that I've resigned as Chief Executive of country's police & crime commissioners. I'm not saying anything publicly."

Article: He remains the world's richest person, despite giving away 64 million shares in Microsoft.
The shares are equivalent to 5% of his total fortune, currently estimated to be $89.9bn.
Since 1994 Mr Gates, 61, and his wife Melinda have given away a total of $35bn in cash and stocks to a range of charitable causes.
The donation was made in June but became public on Monday following the filing of a document with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
Mr Gates' share in Microsoft is now just 1.3%. Prior to this, Mr Gates gave away $16bn in Microsoft shares in 1999 and $5.1bn in 2000.
The majority of all previous donations have been made to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which is primarily focused on reducing world poverty, combating infectious diseases and providing universal access to computers.
It is not known who the recipient of this latest donation is, however when federal documents are filed, it usually means new money is being given to a foundation, the Chronicle of Philanthropy reports.
In 2010, Mr and Mrs Gates and the well-known investor and philanthropist Warren Buffett created the Giving Pledge, and as of May 2017, 158 individuals or couples have agreed to contribute at least half of their wealth to charity.
This latest donation is the biggest charitable gift to have been made anywhere in the world so far this year.
The second largest was made by Mr Buffett, who donated almost $3.2bn to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation last month.
And the third biggest came from Dell Computer Corporation founder Michael Dell and his wife Susan.
In May the couple gave more than $1bn to their foundation, which focuses on children's issues and community initiatives.

Article: Mr King is not the rather better-known writer of horror novels (though his robust opinions on the dangers of monetary largesse can tend towards sleepless nights).
This Mr King is senior economic adviser at HSBC. And a China expert.
Writing about the country's economic slowdown in 2012, he said: "China's debt fuelled expansion was never likely to be sustainable."
The amber warning lights came back on this morning when the ratings agency Moody's downgraded China's credit rating, its investor benchmark for analysing the country's economic performance.
Now, the rating is still A1 - the agency's fifth highest - but nevertheless does highlight growing concerns about the amount of debt the world's most populous country is carrying.
The problem is not the government's direct debt, which at less than 40% of GDP is modest by Western standards, or the eminently manageable 3% deficit (the rate at which that debt is rising).
The issue is the debt being carried by the country's companies, or more specifically the "state-owned enterprises" (SOEs) that constitute the grumbling and sometimes out-of-date engines of the Chinese economy.
And the debts being carried by the country's local governments - which, of course, in a state the size of China, are a little more significant than those of an English town council, say.
Here, the picture is different.
SOE debt stands at 115% of GDP, a figure that is steadily rising and is far higher than, say, comparable figures for Japan and South Korea (where comparable debts are around 30%).
Moody's estimates that bringing the leverage of those firms down to more manageable levels would cost more than $400bn (£308bn).
At the same time, China's own finance ministry has warned that some local authorities are struggling to meet day-to-day operating costs, as they find themselves caught between supporting often inefficient local businesses - making steel, for example - or funding the unpaid debts and unemployment costs associated with shutting down or reforming the mainstays of regional economies.
Now, China certainly has deep pockets.
Its foreign currency reserves stand at more than $3tn and its annual current account surplus is $200bn.
So, debt sustainability is not a near and present danger.
But, if the old joke is that when America sneezes, the rest of the world catches a cold, when it comes to China, it only has to think about reaching for its handkerchief and the global economy can suffer a fit of the vapours.
When China announced weaker-than-expected economic data at the beginning of 2016, world stock markets went into free fall and commodity prices tumbled.
In 2010, average Chinese growth hovered around 10%. It is now between 6% and 7%.
More manageable than the heady days of seven years ago, yes, but there are fears that a lack of economic reform could see growth fall to 5% as President Xi Jinping balances the drive for a more efficient economy (with all the dislocating restructuring costs and possible job losses that could incur) with the need to keep political tension to a minimum.
In a jittery world, China's debt mountain can loom larger than the fundamentals suggest.
And Moody's downgrade is just one straw in the wind.
Asian stock markets hardly paused for breath when it was announced earlier this morning and warnings of a "hard landing" for the Chinese economy have been oft-predicted and not materialised.
But, Chinese bond yields are rising as investors demand a higher risk premium for funding the government's liabilities.
There is no need to rush for the lifeboats yet.
However, it's probably worth knowing where they are.

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence. Moody's has downgraded China's credit rating due to concerns over the country's growing debt, particularly among state-owned enterprises and local governments, although China's foreign currency reserves and current account surplus suggest that debt

Article: There were also celebrations for Bayern Munich, while Zlatan Ibrahimovic was lauded in Paris and Gonzalo Higuain broke a long-standing Serie A scoring record.
But what else happened in Europe this weekend as further champions were crowned and others didn't have it quite as good?
BBC Sport rounds up the stories you might have missed.
Club Brugge are Belgian champions for the first time in 11 years thanks to a 4-0 hammering of title rivals Anderlecht.
There are still two games to go in the play-off system used to determine the title winners.
But Brugge's victory on Sunday means Michel Preud'homme's side are now six points clear and, thanks to finishing top of the regular-season standings, cannot be overhauled.
Top scorer Abdoulay Diaby scored twice within five minutes in the first half, before Hans Vanaken and Timmy Simons added goals after the break to spark Brugge's title celebrations.
Benfica secured a third successive Portuguese title as they held off the challenge of Lisbon rivals Sporting on a fluctuating final day.
The defending champions were two points ahead of Sporting going into Sunday's closing round of games.
Sporting threatened to take the title thanks to a better head-to-head record after they scored their opening goal in a 4-0 win over Braga to go top of the table briefly.
But that situation lasted just three minutes as Benfica then went in front against Nacional through captain Nicolas Gaitan, before going on to complete a 4-1 victory.
Jonas scored the second goal to take the Brazilian's total for the season to 32 as he finished as the league's leading scorer.
Gaitan added the third and Pizzi the fourth as Benfica, who at one point trailed Sporting by eight points, secured the title with a record number of points and club record total of 87 goals for an 18-team division.
Besiktas are the new Turkish champions after they sealed their first title since 2009 with a 3-1 win over Osmanlispor.
Their victory keeps them six points clear of second-placed Fenerbahce, who beat Genclerbirligi 2-1, with one game to go in Turkey's Super League.
Germany international Mario Gomez, 30, fittingly led Besiktas to their 14th championship success as the league's leading scorer added his 26th goal of the season.
On-loan defender Marcelo had earlier scored twice for Besiktas, who last month moved into a new 42,000-seater stadium.
Stuttgart has enjoyed better days than the finale of the regular season in Germany as the city suffered three relegations.
The senior team - three times Bundesliga champions - ended a 39-year stay in the top flight as they were relegated.
It also spelled the end of head coach Jurgen Kramny's spell in charge.
Kramny, 44, replaced Michael Zorniger in November, but will revert to his former job as coach of the reserves, who finished bottom of the German third division.
They therefore drop into regional football, along with Stuttgart Kickers, who were relegated after finishing third from bottom of the third tier.
Steven Fletcher hasn't pulled up many trees in France but marked what may be his last Ligue 1 game for Marseille in eventful fashion as he scored and missed a penalty.
Fletcher's loan move from Sunderland was one of the more surprising January transfer deals and the Scot made an early impression with a cup goal on his first start.
That was it, though, until the former Hibernian, Burnley and Wolves striker, 29, claimed his first league goal in his 12th appearance in a 1-1 draw at bottom club Troyes in Saturday's final round of league fixtures.
There was to be no happy ending as Fletcher then missed a spot-kick inside the last 10 minutes, but he has a chance of salvation and a possible big finish in next weekend's Coupe de France final against Paris St-Germain, who are seeking to complete a domestic treble.
Sevilla obviously enjoy their trips around Europe, if not across Spain.
Unai Emery's side will be bidding to win the Europa League for the third year running when they face Liverpool in the final in Basel on Wednesday night.
Sevilla therefore played a weakened team for their final La Liga fixture on Saturday and lost 3-1 at Athletic Bilbao, meaning they finished the season without a single away league win.
Timothee Kolodziejczak was sent off as Sevilla finished the season in seventh place, with their Copa del Rey final against Barcelona to come next Sunday.
At the bottom of La Liga, Sporting Gijon saved themselves on the final day as they beat fourth-placed Villarreal 2-0.
That meant Getafe, beaten 2-1 at Real Betis, went down with Rayo Vallecano and Levante.
A running sideshow of Italian football this season has been the "will he stay or will he go?" saga of Roma legend Francesco Totti's future.
The former Italy international, 39, is out of contract this summer after 23 years at the Stadio Olimpico.
Totti has been a bit-part player under Luciano Spalletti as Roma finished third in Serie A.
But reports in Italy suggest Roma's record appearance maker has been offered a new deal.
"We have offered Totti another year's contract as a player," Roma director Mauro Baldissoni is quoted as saying in the Italian media.
So... is Totti staying? "We're waiting for a response," Baldissoni reportedly said. "He'll want to think about it."
On the pitch, Palermo secured their Serie A survival with a final-day 3-2 win over bottom club Hellas Verona.
Carpi's 2-1 victory at Udinese was therefore not enough to give them a second season in Italy's top flight.
Elsewhere, Miroslav Klose marked his final game for Lazio by scoring a penalty in his side's 4-2 home defeat by Fiorentina.
The Germany international, 37, leaves after scoring 60 goals during his five seasons in Rome.

Article: Colin Green, a professor of water economics, says Thames Water will make at least £100m a year if it goes ahead.
The utility firm says the tunnel is the best way to stop sewage dumping in the River Thames.
A Thames Water spokesman said it was the most economical way to deal with the problem and no decision on financing the project had been made.
Prof Green, from Middlesex University, claims under current water industry regulations Thames Water would receive 4.5% every year on the super sewer investment.
But he claims the utility firm could borrow the money required to build the tunnel for around 2% a year.
The professor said: "If you want to change this we are going to have to change the price incentives."
Prof Green said the regulatory regime - run by Ofwat - has created an incentive to invest money rather than to operate more efficiently.
A spokesman for Thames Water said: "Detailed and independently-chaired studies have identified the Thames Tunnel as the most economical way to deal with the 39m tonnes of sewage that overflows to the Thames in a typical year.
"We do not yet know who will finance and build the tunnel, but it is by no means certain that it will be Thames Water."
"The rate of return for investors will be set independently by Ofwat," he added.
Prof Green also claimed Thames Water would also see a rise in returns once the loan to build the tunnel was paid off - although this may not happen for 30 to 40 years.
"Even when the loans have been paid off for the tunnel we (the consumer) will have to go on paying for the full capital value of that asset.
"The way the price system works Thames Water will then be getting a return of about 14% upon their share value, just because of the tunnel."

An Ofwat spokesperson said: "We are working with Thames Water, Defra and other stakeholders to support the development and financing of the Thames Tunnel and to ensure that any incurred costs are efficient and continue to represent best value to customers."
Hammersmith and Fulham Council has been campaigning for a cheaper solution to London's sewage problem - such as a shorter tunnel.
Councillor Harry Phibbs said: "It is quite within the rules, but what is happening is that within the rules they will be able to charge customers a much higher rate for the money they are borrowing than they are actually paying themselves.
"This means that they have got a huge financial interest in the scheme going ahead on the most expensive gold-plated basis possible."

Article: The former striker, still remarkably fresh faced for 40, is now attempting to make an impact as a Premier League manager at Cardiff City, having spent three seasons in his native Norway in charge of Molde.
One of the biggest things he did was make the players feel more confident. It wasn't magic - it was paying attention to the details
His spell there brought two top-flight titles, the first in Molde's history, as well as a Norwegian Cup as he quickly established a reputation as a promising young manager.
Those who know Solskjaer describe him as mild mannered and gentle, with a knack for getting the best out of players and a desire to play attacking football. They also call him tough-minded and ambitious.
But how will a manager used to "complete control" of team affairs fare in one of Europe's most unforgiving leagues and under one of the Premier League's more controversial owners in Malaysian businessman Vincent Tan?
"He showed he is a good manager in the short time he was here at Molde," says the club's Norway international goalkeeper Espen Bugge Pettersen. "There is no reason why he should not be successful.
"He probably has not changed a lot since his playing days. He is a mild and gentle guy but when it is needed he can put his foot down.
"You won't find anyone who has a bad word to say about him, because they don't exist. He isn't afraid of making the tough decisions but he does it the right way and if he is not satisfied he will let you know."
Solskjaer, scorer of Manchester United's injury-time winner in their 1999 Champions League final triumph over Bayern Munich, ended his 11-year playing career at Old Trafford with six Premier League titles and two FA Cups to add to that Champions League winners' medal.
Injuries disrupted his final few years as a player and he was then offered a coaching role at the club by Sir Alex Ferguson, where as reserve team boss he won the Manchester Senior Cup, the Lancashire Senior Cup and the Premier League reserve play-offs.
"Ole always wanted to stay in the game, so from an early age he was preparing to stay in the game as a coach or as a manager," Ferguson told the Manchester Evening News in 2012.
"He was always one of the professionals who used to take down all the notes from the training sessions and games. He has got an inner toughness, there's no doubt about that."
Given his first senior managerial role at Molde in 2011, Solskjaer delivered instant success at the club from which Manchester United had signed him in 1996.
A first Tippeligaen title in the club's 100-year history arrived in his first season, breaking the dominance of Rosenberg, who had won 16 of the previous 19 championships, followed by a successful title defence and then the Norwegian Cup in November.
"Molde is a small place with 25,000 to 30,000 people," says Jonas Bergh-Johnsen, a journalist for Norwegian TV channel TV2. "It is small club and he won the league at his first attempt and I think it surprised him.
"They say the most difficult thing is to recreate success but he did. It was a magnificent achievement, massive for the town and for the club. He was a hero before but now he is a legend.

"There wasn't loads of money to spend at Molde but he got together a very good group of young players who wanted to play for him. A lot of his success has come from developing young players."
Like Ferguson, Bergh-Johnsen marks out the young manager for his "mental toughness".
"At the start of last season, things were not going well and he was getting a lot of criticism," he adds "This was a new thing for him but he dug deep and turned things round."
Solskjaer's playing career, which included 67 caps for Norway, earned him instant respect when he arrived as manager at Molde but those who played under him insist he brought far more than just his reputation.
"He is a legend in Norway, in football, and he brought that aura with him," says keeper Petterson. "He was able to get that little bit extra out of the players
"When he came, the club was good and the squad was good. The year before, we came second so the platform was already there.
"But one of the biggest things he did was make the players feel a little bit more confident. He made us all feel special and wanted. It wasn't magic, it was by paying attention to the fine details.
"He changed a lot around the place. He put pictures up around the ground, like they have at Old Trafford, and brought a lot of what he learned at Manchester United to Molde.
"He wants his teams to play attacking football but he also insists on hard work. I am sure he will stick with that philosophy in the Premier League."
Cardiff are not the first Premier League club to have been tempted by Solskjaer's early managerial promise.
He held talks with Aston Villa owner Randy Lerner in May 2012 following the sacking of Alex McLeish but decided to remain with Molde because he was reluctant to uproot his family from Norway.
He was also a candidate to replace Steve Kean at Blackburn Rovers in the Championship last season after the Scot's troubled relationship with controversial owners Venky's finally came to an end.
Some in Norway are surprised he has now opted to make his Premier League managerial debut under Bluebirds owner Tan.
But it is not as simple as that, according to former Norway and Middlesbrough striker Jan Aage Fjortoft, now a football pundit.
"It has always been said that a manager has to find the right owner," says Fjortoft. "If you believe everything you read about Tan, you would think 'any owner but him'.
"Ole has seen something at the club, though, and has seen this is a big chance.
"At Molde, he did have full control and was completely hands on, so wherever he went it would be a challenge because he would not get that control he has been used to."
Not everything will be unfamiliar in his new environment, however. Solskjaer will take former Manchester United and Sheffield United midfielder Mark Dempsey, his assistant at Molde, with him to south Wales.
Solskjaer's former Norway team-mate Morten Gamst Pedersen, who spent nine years at Blackburn, believes the duo work well together.
"It is always an advantage if you can come in with people you know," says Pedersen. "I know Mark well as I used to train at Tromso sometimes where he was coach. He is a very good coach.
"There is no getting away from the fact Ole is a very nice guy. I remember he wished me luck by text when I joined Blackburn but there is no reason you can't be nice and succeed.
"He has never had lots of money to spend before so it will be interesting to see how he copes with that. He knows the English game, though, and is a very clever guy, so I think he will deal with it all well."
Solskjaer's new Premier League adventure begins with a home match against Newcastle United in the FA Cup, before Premier League trips to former employers Manchester United and their local rivals Manchester City later this month.
"The best word to describe him is adjustable," says Fjortoft. "He wants to play football and wants to play the ball from the back, with speed and young kids, like he did at Molde.
"But he won't be naive. He will be ready to fit around what best suits the match and the players. He has a very good footballing mind.
"I think he might bring Mats Moller Daehli and goalkeeper Orjan Haskjold Nyland with him from Molde but he also has to find the right market for Cardiff. He has to find the right mix."

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is fondly remembered by Manchester United supporters as the "baby-faced assassin" whose goalscoring talents - frequently as a substitute - helped them conquer the Premier League and Europe.

Article: Earlier this month, NRW estimated the lagoon would mean 21% of salmon and 25% of sea trout dying each year, as they migrate to and from local rivers.
Tidal Lagoon Power (TLP) said the claims had no "clear scientific basis".
NRW said its figures were based on the "best available evidence" it received.
In a briefing note sent to AMs and seen by BBC Wales, TLP disputed NRW's figures and claimed that the regulator refused to share its methodology for calculating them.
"Without clear scientific basis NRW has recently published figures based in these 'what if' scenarios despite our request to consider the evidence needed to back them up prior to publication," the briefing said.
"These scenarios give unrealistic and grossly misleading impact figures [on fish]," the briefing adds.
TLP said that computer modelling carried out by experts on its behalf estimated a "worst case scenario" of the lagoon killing 2% of all species of fish.
The Â£1.3bn Swansea tidal lagoon project is being viewed by the firm as a test bed for much larger and more cost effective versions around the coast, including Cardiff, Newport and Colwyn Bay.
UK government ministers are considering the findings of a six-month review of the viability of the scheme, which is yet to be published.
Wales' Environment Secretary Lesley Griffiths said the Welsh Government was "very supportive" of the scheme.
But she said both it and the industry needed clarity on the UK government's position in the "very, very near future."
NRW said it strongly disagreed with TLP's criticism, which it was "very surprised and disappointed by".
Gareth O'Shea, an NRW executive director, said: "We have received a vast amount of evidence on this subject from the applicant and have held detailed discussions with the developer for a year-and-a-half where we have shared a huge amount of information, data and our methodology.
"This has been assessed by independent experts and our own technical experts, and we have the utmost confidence that it is the best evidence available to enable us to make the right decision for the environment in Wales, as we are legally bound to do."

Its mate LF15 is expected soon at the Scottish Wildlife Trust reserve near Dunkeld, which operates a live webcam of the nest.
The pair fledged three chicks in both 2015 and 2016.
Charlotte Fleming, Perthshire ranger for the Scottish Wildlife Trust said: "One of our eagle eyed volunteers spotted LM12 just after 17:00.
"He spent several hours in the nearby trees but didn't touch down on the nest until early this morning when he appeared carrying his breakfast.
"From the views we've had of his distinctive chest pattern and long wing tips we are as sure as we can be that it is LM12.
"He has also made himself well and truly at home, bringing in sticks and preparing the nest, which is further proof that he is the resident male."

Article: Flight MU736 was heading from Sydney, Australia to Shanghai, but the pilot reported problems with the engine about one hour after taking off.
Passengers, who had to spend the night in Sydney, told media they smelt something burning inside the aircraft.
The Airbus A330 landed safely and there were no reports of injuries.
Images circulating on social media showed a large hole in the engine casing.
Several passengers said they had heard a loud sound coming from the left engine shortly after take-off.
One passenger told Australia's Seven News network: "All of a sudden we heard this noise... it kind of smelt like burning".
"I was really scared. Our group was terrified."
One woman on the flight told news agency Reuters: "The cabin crew went out and told us to fasten our seatbelts and tried to calm us down, but we were actually very panicked because we had no idea what was happening."
Passengers said the crew cleared the seats near the affected engine.
China Eastern Airlines said in a statement to the media that the crew had "observed the abnormal situation of the left engine and decided to return to Sydney airport immediately".
It added that all passengers would be placed on flights leaving on Monday.
Aviation safety authorities are now investigating.
Aviation expert Greg Waldron of consulting firm FlightGlobal told the BBC that it would be "difficult to say at this early juncture what caused such extensive damage" to the China Eastern plane.
He said investigators would likely look at all possible factors and examine maintenance records of the aircraft and engine. "They will also carefully assess whether a foreign object may have played a role in this," he said.
Last month, industry websites The Aviation Herald and Aero.de published pictures from social media appearing to show a similar hole in another aeroplane's engine casing.
Mr Waldron added it would be "too early" to say whether the Sydney incident was linked to other cases, but it would be something investigators would consider.

Article: It said in a report that cuts had not been applied equally since 2010, with local authorities in the poorest areas seeing the biggest reductions.
The MPs warned further cuts could undermine councils' financial stability and threaten statutory services.
Local authority funding has been cut as part of efforts to tackle the deficit.
Most local authority funding in England comes from central government, with about a quarter of it raised through council tax.
Public spending watchdog the National Audit Office has said that by 2016 local authority funding will have been cut in real terms by 37% since 2010.
In a report on the financial sustainability of local authorities, the Public Accounts Committee said that while local authorities had responded well to cuts "on the whole", there were concerns over whether some councils would continue to be financially sustainable.
"This is particularly the case for authorities responsible for adult social care and children's services," it said.
Committee chairwoman Margaret Hodge, a Labour MP, said: "These cuts have not hit all local authorities equally, with reductions ranging between 5% and 40%.
"Councils with the greatest spending needs - the most deprived authorities - have been receiving the largest reductions."
The report said the Department for Communities and Local Government - which has overall responsibility for council funding - did not fully understand the impact of funding cuts.
It said the department relied too much on spending data and had insufficient information on service levels, service quality and the financial sustainability of councils.
"Without at least an idea of the amount of funding required to maintain statutory services to a minimum standard, it is hard to see how the department could ensure that local authorities are able to fulfil their statutory duties," Mrs Hodge said.
The report also questioned whether the department was providing effective enough leadership to ensure councils could change the way they deliver their services to absorb future cuts and remain financially sustainable.
"Overall, as pressure from cuts grows, so do the risks to local authorities' finances and their provision of services.
"The depth and quality of the department's insight into these issues needs to keep pace with these changes, something it has struggled so far to achieve," the report said.
In December, ministers outlined an average funding cut of 1.8% in English councils' overall spending power, as part of the local government finance settlement for 2015-16.
Some councils will face cuts of up to 6.4% - which local authority bosses said would "push some authorities to breaking point".
The government says the funding grants settlement was "fair for all parts of the country".
Local Government Minister Kris Hopkins said at the time that the settlement still left councillors with "considerable total spending power", and that many councils were seeing growth in income from business rates.

Councils in the most deprived areas of England have been hardest hit by cuts to their funding, the Public Accounts Committee has said.

Mr and Mrs James live in Eastbourne and have a daughter, Madeleine, aged two.
Immigration Minister James Brokenshire has written to their MP to say after an interval review the Home Office would reconsider her application to remain.
Caroline Ansell MP wrote on her website she was confident the government would reverse the decision because "the three have a right to family life under human rights legislation and because of the impact on young Madeleine should Katy be forced to leave."
Katy's father-in-law Jim Needham told BBC Sussex: "It is a great relief, it is early days yet but we are very hopeful things will progress and justice will be done."
The couple, who married in 2006, said they were victims of a rule change in 2012 which requires British citizens with non-EU spouses to prove an income of at least Â£18,600.

The Foxes completed one of sport's greatest shocks when they won the league with a squad costing £57m.
Winger Riyad Mahrez, striker Jamie Vardy and midfielder N'Golo Kante are among the previously unheralded players to be linked with moves away.
"I'm very, very confident," Ranieri said. "Don't go. If you go another team, you might not get on the pitch."
The Italian, who only replaced Nigel Pearson as manager last summer, was given a standing ovation by journalists as he came into his news conference for Saturday's home game with Everton.
"From the beginning I felt something special," he said. "Never could I imagine this, but it's good. We work so hard."
He laughed off suggestions that he could quit on a high this summer, and added he will not be signing global stars for next season's Champions League campaign.
"I don't want big names here. My lads are special. We have to bring some good players but they must have the same spirit."
Algeria forward Mahrez, 25, won the PFA Player of the Year award after scoring 17 goals and 11 assists.
However, his agent Kamel Bengougam says it is "50/50 at the moment whether he stays or goes".
"We have interest from the UK and overseas," he added.
Everton boss Roberto Martinez, who takes his side to Leicester on Saturday at 17:30 BST, thinks a shock winner of the Premier League is likely to be a one-off.
"What Leicester have achieved is a great inspiration for any team sport and for any group in order to dream high and have huge expectations but I think we need to be realistic that this is not the norm.
"It's something we haven't seen in the modern game and I don't think that's going to be repeated easily."

Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew, whose side face Manchester United in the FA Cup final, said: "Leicester won it after 36 games. Last year for 10 games they were in the best form. For nearly 50 games they've been best in the country.
"It's proof the underdog can do it. And it will give us a boost for the cup final.
"Leicester have shattered the glass ceiling, and I thought it was impossible to break. They've gone and done it. Amazing.

Article: If you leave your mobile phone somewhere do you worry you will not be able to check it?
If any of this sounds familiar, there is a chance you could be spending too much time on social networks.
An exclusive online Newsbeat poll suggests that a quarter of 15 to 18-year-olds in the UK feel happier online than they do in real life.
Dr Radha from The Surgery on Radio 1 has dealt with patients who have displayed "a lot of social anxiety" because they are using social networks too much.
"Being online can provoke a sense of 'I'm not good enough, everyone else is having an amazing life'," she explained.
"It doesn't give us a sense of reality and actually what you will find is most people are probably doing the same thing as you are."
The survey, carried out last month, also suggests a third of 15 to 18-year-olds have met someone in person they originally met through social media.
Dr Radha has said it is important people carefully consider what information they share with the online community.
"What this survey showed is a lot of people go online alone," she said.
"In terms of our personal details and how we respond to messages from other people, we need to make sure we are looking after all of that safely."
Dr Radha was concerned that some people feel safer dealing with people online, rather than in person.
"The more time we spend online, the less we are able to develop our social skills," she explained.
"When you are online you're not getting eye contact with people or perceiving how body language is changing, so as a result what people are saying can be misinterpreted.
"Physical contact, like a hug and a kiss, is really important. You don't get that kind of emotional confidence from being online."
If your online activity is leaving you feeling anxious, Dr Radha has advised that you should "slowly try to wean yourself off it".
She said: "If you are worrying, 'what's going on? What am I missing?' It's a sign that being online too much is quite bad for you.
"Give yourself some rules by saying, 'I'm only going to check things three times a day for this amount of time'."

Article: All 42 Scottish clubs discussed league reconstruction on Tuesday, with a 16-team top-flight among the proposals.
That is the number of teams in the Czech top division and Fitzel believes young talent would have a greater chance to shine in a bigger league.
"I am sure a 16-team league has helped our youth development," he said.
Fitzel was involved with the Czech youth teams from 1998 to 2005, and helped bring through the likes of Tomas Rosicky and Petr Cech.
After a spell as the national coach of Malta he has returned as technical director and general manager of the Czech Republic national team. Fitzel has overseen improved fortunes at all levels of the game after the country missed on qualification for the 2010 World Cup.
Since then, the Czech Republic were quarter-finalists in the 2012 European Championships and finished top of their Euro 2016 qualifying group.
"If we did not have a 16-team league and we only had 12, only a few youth players would get a chance," Fitzel told BBC Scotland.
"The bigger the league, the more teams are playing at a higher level, and the more young players are getting a chance. The more they play, the more they improve through experience of playing in the top league."
From next season, the Czech First League will be ranked nine places above Scotland in the Uefa coefficient rankings, with two teams qualifying for the Champions League qualifiers.
However, Fitzel admits a 16-team league does have its pitfalls and they could end up moving in the opposite direction.
"Currently here in the Czech Republic we are discussing maybe having 10 or 12 teams playing each other four times," Fitzel said. "At the moment we do not play enough games.
"A 16-team league has allowed us to have a winter break of two-and-a-half months. We finish at the end of December and start again at the beginning of March. But it means we only play 14 games in spring and all the clubs are saying we should have more games.
"In a smaller league, maybe there are more interesting games. We are looking at the ice hockey league, where right now they have play-offs and the stadia there is sold-out; even the relegation play-offs. That's fantastic income for the clubs and the stadiums hold 13,000 - 15,000 people."
Fitzel, like many in Europe, has looked on with interest at the Scottish game in the last few years. He says the 12-12-18 set-up that was proposed in 2013 was interesting, but feels clubs should listen to what the supporters want.
"It's an interesting idea," he added. "It is something new, and I always feel if you don't try it then you don't know.
"From my point of view it is interesting to play for relegation or promotion. It could be a long period of games.
"It seems interesting, but the question is do the people want to see this?
"If you have enough teams for a 16 top division, they don't need to be equal. Obviously in Scotland you have two big teams, though now there is a problem with Rangers playing out-with the top tier, but still there is two or three dominant teams."

Article: David Crompton, 52, is to step down in November after four years in the post and 31 years in policing.
His retirement comes after a report by Prof John Drew found the force's response to the abuse was "inadequate".
It was commissioned after the Jay Report found 1,400 girls were abused in Rotherham between 1997 and 2013.
In a brief statement, South Yorkshire Police said: "The chief constable's contract runs until November. He will retire after 31 years in policing."
Prof Drew's report, which was published on Wednesday, said the force "regularly missed" opportunities to tackle the problem of abuse and had "seriously under-resourced" its early work.
The report also said several attempts to alert senior officers to the issue fell on "deaf ears".
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) revealed it was looking into 200 allegations about the conduct of police relating to child sexual exploitation in Rotherham.
It also said it had 55 ongoing investigations linked to at least 66 officers in South Yorkshire and had received more than 100 allegations linked to officers who have not yet been identified.
In a statement, the IPCC said: "From the moment the IPCC wrote to South Yorkshire Chief Constable David Crompton to advise him of our expectations for referrals following the publication of the Jay Report in August 2014, the number of allegations and number of officers involved has steadily increased.
"We first announced an investigation in November 2014 and that related to allegations raised in the Jay Report against 10 officers."
Aside from the issue of abuse in Rotherham, Mr Crompton also faced criticism when Sir Cliff Richard's home was searched in connection with an inquiry into alleged child abuse in 2014.
The force co-operated with the BBC to enable live TV coverage of the raid, which an independent report found had "interfered with his [Sir Cliff's} privacy and may well have caused unnecessary distress".
Mr Crompton took over the chief constable role in 2012 from Meredydd Hughes after he retired from the post.

Article: Mr Tshibala will be leader until presidential elections later this year.
He was expelled from Congo's largest opposition party, the UDPS, last month after contesting the designation of successors to veteran leader Etienne Tshisekedi who died in February.
Mr Tshibala's appointment is likely to further divide Mr Kabila's opponents.
Talks to negotiate his exit from power broke down last week.
Mr Kabila was supposed to step down after his second and final five-year term came to an end last year but the vote to replace him was not held.
The electoral commission cited financial and logistical difficulties.
The arrogance of power
The failure to organise the polls led to a wave of deadly demonstrations by opposition supporters, with calls from diplomats for the president to respect the constitution.
The Roman Catholic Church stepped in to broker a deal at the end of 2016 which outlined the creation of a transitional government that would oversee the elections.
But the deal collapsed because the government and the opposition were unable to agree on the power-sharing mechanism under the arrangement.
The country of 71 million people has not had a peaceful transfer of power since its independence from Belgium in 1960.

Article: The bird, which is named LM12, arrived on Thursday, the earliest reappearance of a resident bird there in almost 50 years.
Its mate LF15 is expected soon at the Scottish Wildlife Trust reserve near Dunkeld, which operates a live webcam of the nest.
The pair fledged three chicks in both 2015 and 2016.
Charlotte Fleming, Perthshire ranger for the Scottish Wildlife Trust said: "One of our eagle eyed volunteers spotted LM12 just after 17:00.
"He spent several hours in the nearby trees but didn't touch down on the nest until early this morning when he appeared carrying his breakfast.
"From the views we've had of his distinctive chest pattern and long wing tips we are as sure as we can be that it is LM12.
"He has also made himself well and truly at home, bringing in sticks and preparing the nest, which is further proof that he is the resident male."

Article: Akinfenwa chested down in the box and saw his deflected shot fly past Bobby Olejnik to continue Wycombe's impressive home form - they have lost just one of six league games at Adams Park this term.
Paul Hayes should have given the hosts the lead after 18 minutes when a bouncing ball fell to him five yards out but his looping header cleared the crossbar.
Exeter striker Reuben Reid's driven 27th-minute shot bounced dangerously in front of Wycombe keeper Jamal Blackman, who temporarily spilled, and the visitors were then denied a glorious chance as Ollie Watkins was penalised for a foul when one-on-one.
The Chairboys dominated the second period as substitute Akinfenwa nodded over and Paris Cowan-Hall flicked Joe Jacobson's delivery wide.
But after 85 minutes, Anthony Stewart's lofted ball from the left fell straight to Akinfenwa, allowing the big striker to turn and smash the ball past Olejnik for his second goal since joining the club.

Article: Last week, Seoul suspended its operations at Kaesong following the North's recent rocket and nuclear tests to cut off the money supply.
The North has called the shutdown "a declaration of war".
Kaesong was one of the last points of co-operation between the two Koreas.
The North reacted to the shutdown by expelling all South Koreans from the complex and freezing the assets of South Korean firms. It has also vowed to cut key communication hotlines with the South.
The privately-run manufacturing zone saw thousands of North Koreans working for South Korean businesses, making clothing, textiles, car parts and semi-conductors.
On Sunday, the South's unification ministry said in a statement the wages, in US dollars, had been paid to the government instead of directly to the workers.
"Any foreign currency earned in North Korea is transferred to the Workers' Party, where the money is used to develop nuclear weapons or missiles, or to purchase luxury goods," said Hong Yong-pyo, the unification minister, in a televised interview, referring to Pyongyang's ruling communist party.
He added that 70% of the money was kept by Pyongyang while workers were given tickets to buy food and essential items, and local currency. The government cited "multiple channels" as its sources for these claims but did not divulge how it had arrived at the percentage.
The South estimates about 616bn Korean won (Â£350m, $508m) had been paid to the North over the years.
Mr Hong was quoted by Yonhap news agency as saying that the South did not suspend operations earlier at Kaesong because "the international community recognised its significance", and it shut it down this time because "North Korea was only going to intensify its weapons development, and we needed to make a decisive move to alleviate our people's security concerns".
On 7 February, North Korea conducted a long-range rocket launch. It came after the country's fourth nuclear test in January.

Article: Fairfax said on Wednesday it would cut 125 editorial jobs - a quarter of its newsroom - to absorb slumping revenues.
In response, staff will strike until after next week's federal budget, one of the year's biggest local news days.
Fairfax's outlets include the Sydney Morning Herald, Melbourne's The Age and the Australian Financial Review.
The latest cuts come in addition to restructuring and cuts in recent years.
The Sydney Morning Herald's chief political correspondent James Massola tweeted "On strike for a week", while his colleague Judith Ireland urged that "quality journalism needs actual journalists to do the job".
Like most media outlets around the globe, Fairfax is suffering from falling circulation of its print editions and declining advertising revenue.
The fresh staff cuts were announced along with plans to scale back the use of freelancers.
"While we will be looking across all parts of the newsroom, at the end of the redundancy program we expect there will be significantly fewer editorial management, video, presentation and section writer roles," the publisher is quoted as saying in an internal note.
Australia's Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance, which represents the country's journalists, strongly criticised the planned cuts at Fairfax as a "dumb move".
"This will only undermine and damage its mastheads further, alienating its audience and leaving the editorial staff that remain to work harder and harder to fill the gaps," chief executive Paul Murphy said.
Fairfax is the main rival to Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Australia, which is also suffering from falling revenues and also has announced plans to cut jobs.

Article: The £155,000 Bike2Go project was the first of its kind in Scotland and it was hoped it could go into other areas.
However, Dumfries and Galloway Council is not including the scheme in a planned regional rollout of initiatives to reduce car journeys.
Since its launch in September 2010 the bikes have been hired 2,270 times - a daily average of about two rentals.
The scheme was set up to encourage people to get "out of their cars and onto their bicycles".
It provides bikes free of charge to subscribers at 11 locations across the town.
It is based on similar schemes in Paris, Barcelona, Stockholm and one in London which clocked up one million journeys in its first 10 weeks.
The Dumfries project has struggled to increase rental levels since it started.
After 10 weeks they averaged about 20-a-week, with winter weather being blamed for the low uptake.
The council promised a marketing campaign to encourage increased use of the bikes.
A poor summer was again blamed for low uptake in 2012.
Plans were then proposed to make the bikes available to all council staff when on business in Dumfries.
However, some councillors questioned the value of the scheme which has 171 members on latest figures.
One suggested it would have been cheaper to buy them all a bicycle and said the project was "in danger of becoming an embarrassment".

The cost of a bike hire scheme in Dumfries works out at more than £60 per rental, new figures show.

The 17-year-old from Gloucestershire won the champion apprentice trophy in his maiden season this year.
Marquand has racked up 68 wins across the last 12 months, prompting his trainer Hannon to make the comparison with Moore.
"I think he could be a champion jockey one day," Hannon told BBC Points West.
"I would be amazed if he does not go right to the top, he is the name on everybody's lips at the moment."
Marquand's rapid rise has seen him nominated for the BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year 2015 award.
The jockey has been named on the final shortlist for the award, alongside gymnast Ellie Downie and para-swimmer Tully Kearney.
"What he has achieved is a little bit special," added Hannon. "He is a lovely guy and thoroughly deserves his success. He is very popular and he has endeared himself with everybody."
Hannon, who has 300 horses based at his stables near Marlborough, is the son of former flat jockey champion Richard Hannon Sr.
Moore has enjoyed great success under the guidance of Hannon and won the champion apprentice title in 2003.
Since then, Moore has established himself as one of the most respected flat jockeys in horse racing and was champion jockey in 2006, 2008 and 2009.
"Ryan Moore performs on the big stage and he is the best jockey in the world at the moment. He is so professional and the ultimate jockey and that's who you want to be," said Marquand, who will find out if he has won the BBC award on Sunday.

Article: Officials from Cuba and Norway, the two countries brokering the peace process, said a week of discussions would begin in Havana on 10 December.
Colombia's president stopped the talks after the rebels seized Gen Ruben Dario Alzate and two others on 16 November.
The captives were released on Sunday.
They were handed over to a humanitarian mission led by the International Red Cross and taken to a military base near the city of Medellin before travelling to be reunited with their families.
"We consider the crisis over and announce that we have agreed that the next cycle of conversations will take place between 10 and 17 December," Reuters quoted a joint statement read by a Cuban official as saying.
The negotiators said the next round of talks would focus on a de-escalation of the conflict, and on meeting the relatives of victims.
They also said the parties had agreed to establish a permanent system to deal with any future crises.
They will reconvene around mid-January, on a date not yet determined.
The negotiations have been under way in Havana since November 2012 and aim to bring an end to five decades of conflict, in which 220,000 people are estimated to have died.
The Red Cross and the Farc said that the handover on Sunday had taken place in a remote location in Choco province, an isolated jungle region on Colombia's Pacific Coast.
Gen Alzate, Cpl Jorge Rodriguez and lawyer Gloria Urrego had been kidnapped 14 days earlier while travelling along the Atrato river by boat. They had ventured into territory dominated by the Farc in civilian clothes and without a security detail.
The Farc said they kidnapped the general because they were unhappy that President Juan Manuel Santos had continued military operations against them during peace talks.
The left-wing rebel group has renewed calls for both sides to call a ceasefire while the peace negotiations proceed.
The government has rejected such calls, saying that a truce would only help the rebel group regroup and rearm.
Gen Alzate resigned from his post on Monday, saying he should have taken more security precautions.

Article: Ri Jong Chol said his detention was a "plot" to "damage the honour of the republic", Reuters news agency reports.
He made the comments outside the North Korea embassy in Beijing after he was deported from Malaysia on Friday.
Ri Jong Chol was released from police custody due to insufficient evidence.
Speaking to reporters early on Saturday, he accused Malaysia of using coercion in an attempt to extract a confession.
Malaysian authorities are continuing their investigation into the death of Mr Kim, the estranged half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who was killed at an airport in the country's capital, Kuala Lumpur nearly three weeks ago.
Ri Jong Chol, who said he was not at the airport on the day of the incident, was the only North Korean held in connection with the death.
Malaysia is seeking to question several North Koreans, including an embassy official.
Two women, Doan Thi Huong from Vietnam and Siti Aisyah from Indonesia, were charged on Thursday with killing Mr Kim by smearing his face with VX, a banned chemical weapon.
Both women said they thought they were taking part in a TV prank. They have yet to make a formal plea in their case.
Malaysia, which has condemned the use of the powerful nerve agent in the 13 February attack, is also investigating a firm thought to be used by North Korea to evade sanctions on military exports.
Ri Jong Chol had lived in Malaysia for three years but, according to Reuters, his work permit expired on 6 February.
Immigration director-general Mustafar Ali said Ri Jong Chol, who was escorted out of Malaysia by two North Korean embassy officials, was blacklisted from re-entering the country.
Meanwhile, the government said it had launched an investigation into a company called Glocom, which has been operating in Malaysia for several years.
According to a confidential United Nations report, Glocom is run by North Korea's top intelligence agency to sell military communications equipment, in violation of UN sanctions.
Police said on Friday that an arrest warrant had been issued for 37-year-old Kim Uk-il, who works for North Korean national airline Air Koryo. He is believed to be still in Malaysia.
Reuters news agency reported that security checks on North Koreans had been stepped up at all border crossings to prevent them from leaving.
On Thursday, Malaysia announced it was cancelling visa-free travel for visiting North Koreans, citing security reasons.
It has not directly blamed North Korea for the attack, but there is widespread suspicion Pyongyang was responsible.
North Korea has strongly rejected the allegations. It also rejected the findings of the post-mortem examination, having objected to it being carried out at all, and has demanded the body be handed over to them.
It has not yet confirmed that the body is that of Kim Jong-nam, acknowledging him only as a North Korean citizen. Mr Kim was travelling using a passport under a different name.

The North Korean suspect questioned in connection with the death of Kim Jong-nam has said he was the victim of a conspiracy by the Malaysian authorities.

Blackburn have also been charged with failing to ensure players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion.

A three-match ban is the standard punishment for a red card for violent conduct.
However, it is alleged that Akpan's behaviour constituted violent conduct in circumstances where the standard punishment that would otherwise apply is clearly insufficient.
He is currently banned for three matches, including Sunday's FA Cup tie with Manchester United.
In 1998, then-Sheffield Wednesday striker Paolo di Canio was banned for 11 games for pushing referee Paul Alcock to the ground.

Article: His correspondents included David Lloyd George, William Gladstone, Rudyard Kipling, George Bernard Shaw and Arthur Conan Doyle.
And on his death 100 years ago, obituaries were effusive in their praise, calling him the last of the great Victorians.
You would be forgiven for the name Charles Darwin popping into your head - but you would be wrong.
The theory of evolution by natural selection was published jointly between Darwin and Monmouthshire-born Alfred Russel Wallace, whose interest in natural history developed when he moved to Neath and worked as a land surveyor with his brother.
But while today Darwin is a household name synonymous with the theory, Wallace struggles to gain anywhere near the recognition of his friend.
This is illustrated by an appeal this year to raise funds for a life-sized bronze statue to honour Wallace - it only reached half of its Â£50,000 target.
Wallace expert Dr George Beccaloni, who is a curator at the Natural History Museum where the statue would stand, said: "We have enough money to pay for a torso and arms at the moment.
"There are hundreds of Darwin statues and busts but there's not even a bust of Wallace.
"There's a side-profile roundel on the wall at Westminster Abbey - not far from Darwin's grave. There's not a lot else."
Interestingly, Wallace was not overlooked during his lifetime and was awarded the Order of Merit, the highest honour that could be given by the British monarch to a civilian.
His correspondents included some of the most significant politicians in recent British history, and celebrated authors and poets.
"He was extremely famous and possibly the most famous scientist and one of the most famous people in the world when he died (in 1913)," said Dr Beccaloni.
"There were very long, glowing obituaries in all the world's papers from Bombay to Boston saying he was the last of the great Victorians.
"One of the papers said only a great ruler would have had the sort of level of obituary recognition as Wallace."
He said Darwin was more famous but died many years before Wallace leaving Wallace to go on and become "the most famous living biologist in Britain".
So where did it go wrong for Wallace's reputation?
Prof Jim Costa, director of a biological research station in North Carolina, USA, and an expert on both men, says part of the problem appears to be that Wallace failed to promote his role in formulating the theory as effectively as Darwin.
While they had jointly published the theory of evolution by natural selection in a paper in August 1858, it was Darwin's On the Origin of Species the very next year that truly grabbed the public's imagination.
Even one of Wallace's own books appeared to pass on the credit for the discovery. It was called 'Darwinism: An Exposition of the Theory of Natural Selection with Some of Its Applications'!
Prof Costa said another factor was what became known as the "eclipse of Darwinism", when natural selection fell out of favour in the late 19th Century.
By the time it was revived in the 1930s, neither man was around and the world was a very different place.
"I think when this idea was resurrected in 1930 there was a new generation and they very much had Darwin on their minds," said Prof Costa.
"Wallace I think had a role in this - his book 'Darwinism' for example. He tended to downplay his role in public forums and that just didn't serve him well.
"When it [natural selection] was resurrected, it was always associated with Darwin."
He said when evolutionary biology really took off in the 1940s, the history of the discovery had been largely forgotten.
A Darwin "industry" developed and, said Prof Costa, it viewed Darwin as the "great visionary".
While little has changed since in terms of public acclaim, there are signs that Wallace's work is gaining more recognition in certain circles.
A series of events are being held around the world to commemorate the centenary of Wallace's death this year under the Wallace100 banner.
These include an exhibition in Swansea, a lecture in Berlin and a two-day conference in Malaysia.
Comedian Bill Bailey recently unveiled a restored portrait of Wallace at the Natural History Museum and has also filmed a two-part documentary for the BBC about Wallace.
Thousands of Wallace's letters have been put online for the first time, including correspondence with Darwin about evolution by natural selection.
There is even hope for the statue with renewed efforts being made to raise the rest of the money by August.
But gaining the same level of acclaim as Darwin is another matter.
"I think that in the popular imagination, it would be very, very difficult. It's indelibly Darwin and monkeys," said Prof Costa.
"I don't think there's much we can do about that but I do think he will emerge from relative eclipse by Darwin, certainly in the broad academic world and the world of naturalists.
"He contributed so much."

He jointly came up with the theory of evolution by natural selection, corresponded with the great and good of society, and was given the highest honour possible from a British monarch.

Article: Biologists studied a group of Sydney octopuses off Australia's east coast and observed a range of behaviour that may indicate complex social signalling.
Octopuses that stand tall, turn dark and spread their web in a "Nosferatu pose" are likely showing aggression.
Conversely, octopuses may display a pale colour after losing a fight or when trying to avoid conflict.
It was previously believed that octopuses were largely solitary creatures. Changes to body colour and other behaviour were interpreted as tactics to avoid predators.
But Prof Peter Godfrey-Smith said the unique study, based on 53 hours of footage and published on Friday in the journal Current Biology, provided a novel perspective on octopus behaviour.
"[An aggressive] octopus will turn very dark, stand in a way that accentuates its size and it will often seek to stand on a higher spot," Prof Godfrey-Smith, who co-authored the report, said.
"Clearly the unusual stance is not a physiological response. It makes it look as big as it can possibly be, with its arms spread out below and the mantle, the back part of the animal, raised over the head.
"The dark colour is produced in concert with those size-accentuating behaviours. There's no particular physiological reason why darkness should be associated with aggression, but it does give the impression of a larger object."
The researchers, based in Australia and the US, dubbed the stance the "Nosferatu pose", referring to the classic 1920s horror film, because the spread of the octopus's web was reminiscent of a vampire's cape.
Octopuses frequently turned pale while retreating from aggressors and also produced high-contrast patterns known as deimatic displays.
The contrasting patterns were most frequently observed when octopuses were attempting to return to their den after they had been forced out, or in the presence of an aggressive individual.
"Suppose there's a large, aggressive guy there and you want to get back into our den, if you approach with a pale colour it could be interpreted as a non-confrontational behaviour," Prof Godfrey-Smith said.
The study also found that two octopuses displaying dark colours were likely to fight if in close proximity, while a darker-coloured octopus was likely to stand its ground against a lighter-coloured octopus.
Another cephalopod, the cuttlefish, shows a similar set of features, with aggressive males darkening their faces and paler males withdrawing from fights.
The unusually high number of octopuses living together in the colony off Jervis Bay, south of Sydney, allowed a more in-depth observation of interactions than had previously been possible.
Prof Godfrey-Smith's co-author David Scheel and his students combed through 53 hours of footage and observed 186 interactions between the octopuses.
This included the Nosferatu pose, along with reaching, grappling and mating.
Watching these long videos was "much more exhausting than I expected", Prof Godfrey Smith said.
"Identifying an individual from minute to minute is very difficult, because they change colour and shape.
"If the octopus wanders out of the frame, there's not much you can do."

Article: Supporters of new President Mohammed Mursi are in a stand-off with generals who have ruled since President Hosni Mubarak was ousted last year.
Speaking after talks with Mr Mursi, Mrs Clinton said the situation required "compromise and real politics".
She also praised Egypt's military council for its interim leadership.
Mr Mursi, of the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, was elected in June in the country's first freely contested leadership vote.
'Prevent confrontation'
The hour-long meeting between President Mursi and Mrs Clinton was described by a US official as candid and cordial.
By Kim GhattasBBC News, Cairo
Hillary Clinton wanted to come to Egypt soon after the elections because the US believes it is important to engage with President Mursi early on. The meeting was described by officials as good and candid but this is still a tentative relationship, not a full embrace.
The US administration is slowly feeling its way in the region, learning to work with groups that Washington has shunned in the past.
When Condoleezza Rice was here in 2005 as US Secretary of State, she was categorical - the US would not engage with the Muslim Brotherhood. But in the new Arab world, long-held American assumptions about who is a friend or not have been shattered. And new problems have emerged.
Outside Mrs Clinton's hotel, dozens of Egyptians protested against Mr Mursi and continued US military aid to Egypt under his presidency with slogans like: "We don't want Hamas to rule Egypt."
Afterwards, Mrs Clinton told reporters: "I have come to Cairo to reaffirm the strong support of the United States for the Egyptian people and their democratic transition.
"We want to be a good partner and we want to support the democracy that has been achieved by the courage and sacrifice of the Egyptian people."
The BBC's Jon Leyne in Cairo says that for all the US fears of an Islamist takeover in recent decades, the governments in Washington and Egypt have now realised they need each other.
Mr Mursi and the Muslim Brotherhood are particularly keen to avoid the sort of international isolation that has been so damaging to other Islamist governments after they have taken office, our correspondent adds.
Saturday's talks launched a series of high-level meetings aimed at stabilising Egypt's fledgling democracy and its alliance with the US.
Mr Mursi has tried to defuse a row over parliament - a body he tried to reinstate by decree last weekend.
The chamber, dominated by Mr Mursi's Islamist allies, was shut down by the military before he took power. The Supreme Constitutional Court has said the dissolution is final.
Mr Mursi says he is "committed to the rulings of Egyptian judges and very keen to manage state powers and prevent any confrontation".
Mrs Clinton said she would meet the head of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (Scaf), Field Marshal Mohammed Hussein Tantawi, on Sunday.
He became the country's interim ruler after the fall of President Hosni Mubarak in February last year.
Mrs Clinton praised the role played by the military, but said she would make clear to Field Marshal Tantawi that the US supports the return of the armed forced "to a purely military role".
The secretary of state also encouraged President Mursi to live up to his promises to protect the rights of women and minorities, and to preserve the peace treaty with Israel.
Mrs Clinton arrived in Egypt from a week-long trip to Asia, and will later visit Israel.

Article: They range from extra responsibility for off-street parking, through to tourism.
Potentially, though, the most controversial move will be putting politicians in charge of all but the most significant planning decisions.
Councils will be able to accept or reject developments in their own areas.
Currently, if you want to build a new house or erect an extension, you have to apply for permission to the Planning Service, an agency that comes under the umbrella of Stormont's environment department.
Planning officials refer your application to your local council. The councillors can express their opinion on the merits of your application, but the final say rests with the Planning Service.
From April 2015 that responsibility will shift to the councils themselves, meaning elected politicians will make planning decisions.
So is this a positive move, democratising our planning system?
Michael Corr, the creative director of Northern Ireland's architecture and planning centre, PLACE, is optimistic.
Mr Corr already works with councils and government departments, providing advice on new developments like leisure centres.
He told me the move is "a huge opportunity for the future, which offers local councils an opportunity to develop their own community and development plans".
But do Northern Ireland's politicians have the necessary skills?
Speaking about voters, Mr Corr said: "They really want to choose politicians who have the ability and understand urban regeneration and planning issues, because it's those politicians who will be able to make the biggest difference."
However, not everyone is so upbeat.
Back in the 1960s, local councils in Northern Ireland were accused of discrimination in the allocation of public housing.
Protests, like the one against Dungannon council's allocation of housing in County Tyrone, fuelled the Civil Rights movement.
The environmental group Friends of the Earth warn that a strict code of conduct will have to be rigorously enforced in order to ensure the new councils' handling of planning matters is regarded as fair and transparent.
James Orr, Northern Ireland director for Friends of the Earth, said: "In terms of property deals and in terms of politicking, we could see a situation not too far away from what happened in the 1960s, where certain communities get planning permission more favourably than other communities."
Mr Orr is also concerned about what he describes as a "tradition of close relationships between developers and political parties here".
He said: "It's quite easy to see that continuing, where we get a laissez-faire system which says, 'you look after your community and we won't bother engaging in proper democratic planning'. That is a real danger and that's why we need the nuts and bolts of good transparency put in place."
Friends of the Earth argue that giving politicians more powers with real financial consequences for developers and objectors makes it increasingly important that the public should know who donates to Northern Ireland's political parties.
Some local politicians remain opposed to the move, because they say it could deter donors worried about their personal security.
Others argue that the Â£7,500 limit for declaring donations is largely irrelevant to Northern Ireland, as the Stormont parties don't attract such large amounts.
Under the terms of a law passed earlier this year, it's up to the Northern Ireland Secretary to decide when the time is right to make an order shedding more light on political donations.

Article: A foul smell led residents to the site in March.
The government says all the bodies were buried in a single night and include stillborn babies and unclaimed bodies.
But Human Rights Watch says they must check to see if any of the people killed during anti-government protests in January have been buried there.
Dozens of demonstrators died in protests over a proposed electoral law change which would have required a national census to be held before the presidential election could take place.
The US-based watchdog Human Rights Watch (HWR) has said that bodies went missing during the protests and also during government crackdowns on criminal gangs in the capital last year and in 2013.
Human rights workers first became aware of the burial site after residents of Maluku in Kinshasa reported a terrible smell near the local cemetery more than two weeks ago.
A woman working in the field then discovered a limb sticking out of the ground.

The Toffees will pay about £5m compensation for the 53-year-old Dutchman, who leaves Saints after two years in charge.
Everton have been without a manager since they sacked Roberto Martinez just before the end of the 2015-16 season.
It is expected Koeman's appointment will be confirmed by Friday.
Listen: Saints fans feeling let down by Koeman
BBC Radio 5 live's Football Daily podcast
Koeman, who has been headhunted by new Everton owner Farhad Moshiri, will sign a deal reported to be worth about £6m a year.
The former Netherlands international, who is on holiday, will take brother Erwin and fitness coach Jan Kluitenberg with him to Goodison Park.
Saints have finished seventh and sixth under Koeman - their best Premier League campaigns.
Martinez promised Champions League qualification when appointed but Everton finished 11th in 2015-16, his third year at the club.
In April, Saints chairman Ralph Krueger said discussions with Koeman over a new deal were progressing "in a very good direction", but added the club was "not in any real hurry".
And last month the former Ajax, PSV Eindhoven and Barcelona defender said he expected to stay with the Saints for the final year of his contract.
Koeman made more than 763 appearances as a player, scoring 253 goals, and won the 1988 European Championship with the Netherlands.
He won the European Cup - now the Champions League - with PSV Eindhoven in 1988 and Barcelona in 1992, scoring the winner for the latter against Sampdoria at Wembley.
He also won four domestic league titles apiece in the Netherlands and Spain.
Koeman has since managed Vitesse Arnhem, Ajax, Benfica, PSV, Valencia, AZ Alkmaar, Feyenoord and Southampton.
He has won the Dutch league with both Ajax and PSV.
Reaction
Former Southampton and England forward Matt le Tissier said he was "disappointed" and "quite surprised" at Koeman's decision to leave, particularly with Saints playing in the Europa League next season.
"He may feel he has got a better chance of winning trophies at Everton. I'd be of a slightly different opinion," Le Tissier told BBC Sport. "I understand they've got a new owner and want to splash a bit of cash, but it might not be as easy a job as he thinks.
"Most clubs in the Premier League are pretty wealthy now and can compete in the transfer market. We just have to move on and look to the next man to take us forward again.
"The players' loyalty lies with the football club and hopefully they will kick us on again next season."

Article: The ECB has also appointed ex-Test batsman James Whitaker as chairman of selectors after announcing Geoff Miller's surprise resignation.
I am excited by the challenge of building on the success which England have enjoyed in recent years
Downton, 56, replaces Hugh Morris, who quit to take up the dual role of chief executive and managing director at County Championship side Glamorgan.
Ex-England captains Andrew Strauss and Nasser Hussain were linked to the job.
"I am honoured to have been offered this position and the trust which the ECB has placed in me," said Downton, who starts his new job on 1 February.
"I am excited by the challenge of building on the success which England teams have enjoyed at all levels in recent years."
Downton played 30 Tests for England between 1981 and 1988, plus 28 one-day internationals. He was part of the squads which won the Ashes in 1981 and 1985, and reached the 1987 World Cup final.
The ex-Kent and Middlesex player also played in six County Championship-winning teams. He was forced to retire from the game after a bail struck him in the eye during a Sunday League match.
Since retiring in 1991, he has been an active member of Middlesex, ECB Cricket and MCC committees and pursued a law career in the City.
ECB chief executive David Collier said Downton's experience in cricket and business made him "the outstanding candidate" to replace Morris, who announced he was leaving the role last month and had said Strauss, 36, would do a "great job" if named as his successor.
Collier added: "Paul's experience of a World Cup final, Ashes success, six County Championship wins and 58 international appearances for England provides a wealth of cricket experience.
"His background in law when coupled with his experience in the City provides the unique set of skills which is required to lead and manage the England Cricket Department's £100m budget over the next four years."
The ECB said Miller, 61, announced his intention to step down from his role during the summer's Ashes win against Australia. He joined the England selection panel in 2000, before replacing David Graveney as chairman of selectors eight years later.
Former England and Leicestershire batsman Whitaker, 51, replaces Miller after being part of the selection panel for the past eight years.

Article: The problem is that so many of the initiatives and ideas sold to the country as ground-breaking prove to be business as usual.
So the Communities Secretary Sajid Javid went out of his way to sound no-nonsense and tough today. He accused some English councils of "fudging" the numbers on housing need in their area and warned them that he was not going to allow that to happen anymore.
But the response to the government's proposals has been decidedly mixed.
Labour's shadow housing minister John Healey described them as "feeble beyond belief".
"Re-treading old ground" was how the National Association of Commercial Finance Brokers described the White Paper.  "Kicking the can down the road," one big investment fund said.
The chief executive of the housebuilder Inland Homes, Stephen Wicks, bemoaned the failure to relax rules on green belt development.
"Brownfield in itself can't possibly sustain the long-term housing requirements of the UK," he said.  "It can go an awful long way but there needs to be a relaxation of some green belt to enable us to deliver the numbers that we are required to do."
The White Paper does include measures to encourage developers, housing associations and councils to build more affordable homes more quickly, both to rent and to buy.
But this government seems to speak with two voices on housing: the communities department wants to shift the balance of power firmly towards new development in places people want to live, but Number 10 and some influential Tory backbenchers are sympathetic to the passionate concerns of those who wish to protect the countryside and particularly the green belt.
The real question that lies behind all the rhetoric and policy bullet-points is whether the balance of power between development and local opposition has fundamentally changed.
Ministers now accept England needs 250,000 new homes every year, they have described the housing market as "broken" and they agree that radical change is the only way to mend it.
But many have yet to be convinced that this White Paper amounts to a "realistic plan" to achieve that.

Article: The footage shows gunmen beating and shooting a group of prisoners who were cowering on the floor.
It has been alleged that Islamist militants carried out the attack after seizing army checkpoints on Thursday.
Unconfirmed reports say troops have now quit all bases near the strategic northern town of Saraqeb.
The town lies near the main roads linking Aleppo to Damascus and the coastal city of Latakia.
The army, meanwhile, continued its air strikes across Syria on Thursday.
In all, more than 150 people reportedly died in fighting, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a UK-based activist group.
The SOHR said that among the victims were more than 70 government soldiers, 43 civilians and 38 rebels.
The claim has not been independently verified.
In other developments:
The alleged shootings took place after the rebels overran the strategic army checkpoints between on Thursday.
The video appears to show agitated rebels kicking and pushing the soldiers or pro-government militiamen, known locally as "shabiha", to the ground inside one of the seized buildings. Shots are then fired into the cowering mass of bodies.
Rupert Colville, of the UN High Commission for Human Rights, said it appeared that the victims "were no longer combatants and therefore, at this point, it looks very like a war crime".
He added that the video, if proved to be genuine, would almost certainly form part of a future prosecution.
Rights group Amnesty said in a statement: "This shocking footage depicts a potential war crime in progress, and demonstrates an utter disregard for international humanitarian law by the armed group in question."
No group has so far admitted carrying out the alleged killings.
However, a rebel fighter from Idlib province, Abu Abdul Rahim, told the Guardian that a Salafi-jihadist group was behind the killings, which he said had occurred in al-Nayrab, to the west of Saraqeb.
He said Salafists of the Dawood brigade and Suqur al-Sham did not answer to any military council affiliated to the rebel Free Syrian Army.
For months, activists have reported similar summary killings by government forces virtually every day.
But there has been mounting evidence of similar tactics being used by some rebel groups too, although many have signed a code of practice banning such abuses, says the BBC's Jim Muir in neighbouring Lebanon.
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton earlier warned that radical Islamist fighters were trying to hijack the Syrian revolution.
The comments have drawn an angry response from some opposition leaders, who say that it is the failure of the outside world to support the uprising with practical help that has left the field open to the radicals.
The SOHR says more than 36,000 people have been killed since protests against President Bashar al-Assad erupted in March 2011.
The SOHR is one of the most prominent organisations documenting and reporting incidents and casualties in the Syrian conflict. It says its reports are impartial, though its information cannot be independently verified.

Article: A tractor laden with explosives was driven at a military police station, a statement said.
The attack happened early on Sunday near the town of Dogubayezit in Agri province, near the border with Iran.
Since 24 July, Turkey has carried out hundreds of air raids on PKK bases on both sides of the Iraq-Turkey border.
A Turkish state news agency, Anadolu, said the tractor was carrying two tons of explosives that were detonated by a suicide bomber.
Turkey's army said in a statement that "long-range guns" were also found. Four of the injured were in a serious condition.
The statement said the Karabulak Gendarmerie Station was hit at around 03:00 local time on Sunday (midnight GMT).
Images in the Turkish press showed a badly-damaged building with the roof destroyed.
One report said the blast was so strong that houses in a village several hundred metres away were hit by debris and some residents were slightly injured.
The Dogan news agency added that militants also set up ambushes on roads to prevent medical teams getting to the scene.
There has been no comment from the PKK so far.
AFP news agency said it would be the first time the group was accused of deploying a suicide bomber during recent clashes.
Turkey says the group was behind a number of attacks in the last two weeks:
Turkey's official news agency says about 260 Kurdish fighters have been killed in strikes in northern Iraq and Turkey since 24 July. It has also targeted positions held by the Islamic State group.
At least six people were killed and several wounded in further Turkish air strikes on Saturday east of Erbil, said local officials.
The pro-PKK Firat news agency described an attack on the village of Zerkel as a "massacre".
Iraqi Kurdish President Massoud Barzani said: "We condemn the bombing, which led to the martyrdom of the citizens of the Kurdish region, and we call on Turkey to not repeat the bombing of civilians."
The Turkish military on Sunday said it had investigated the incident and dismissed claims that there could have been civilian casualties in Zerkel, Reuters reported.
Turkey considers both the PKK and IS terrorist organisations.
The PKK has been fighting Turkey for an autonomous homeland for the Kurds.
More than 40,000 people have been killed and hundreds of thousands displaced since the PKK began an armed uprising in 1984.
In 2012, the government and PKK began peace talks and the following year a ceasefire was agreed.
However, the ceasefire ended in effect when Turkey launched raids against Kurdish separatist camps in northern Iraq last month.
The raids came after the PKK reportedly killed two Turkish police officers in retaliation for an attack claimed by Islamic State and what the PKK sees as Turkey's collaboration with IS.

Article: The study by Napier University found those on benefits were anxious that changes to their circumstances would push them into "crisis situations".
Scottish Social Justice Secretary Alex Neil urged the UK government to rethink its reforms.
But the Department for Work and Pensions said the changes were designed to help people into work.
The Welfare Reform Tracking Study, which was carried out by Edinburgh Napier University on behalf of the Scottish government, also highlighted criticism of how the details of reforms were communicated to recipients of benefits.
Some disabled people who took part in the study said they felt they had to present themselves in a "negative light and focus on their limitations" when claiming.
Other participants spoke of stress, anxiety and depression brought on by assessments, and a fear of further changes.
Mr Neil accused the UK government's "austerity agenda and benefit cuts" of having a "damaging effect" on people in Scotland.
He added: "Their approach is slashing the incomes of some of our poorest households and pushing 100,000 children into poverty.
"The study is further evidence that people are living in constant anxiety about changes to their entitlements and are already suffering from the effects of around Â£6bn of cuts taken from Scottish welfare expenditure over the last five years.
"Despite these frustrations we will do all we can to use our new powers to make our system fairer and simpler and work to improve the experience for people."
However, a spokesman for the Department of Work and pensions said the reforms were about giving people peace of mind.
He added: "Reforms to welfare are designed to help people into work, giving more people the peace of mind and security that comes with a steady income - there are now near record numbers of people in Scotland in a job.
"The government provides a safety net to support millions of people who are unemployed or on low incomes, spending Â£94bn a year across the UK on working age benefits."

The fear is a "soft" post-Brexit border between Northern Ireland and Ireland could result in more stringent controls at Welsh ports for freight operators.
First Minister Carwyn Jones has warned that could mean job losses.
The Irish Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Patrick O'Donovan, and representatives from the Irish Exporters Association were among those meeting AMs during the Dublin visit.
The UK's formal Brexit negotiations with the European Commission started on Monday in Brussels.
Launching a paper on Brexit and devolution last week, Mr Jones said the question of Ireland was "insoluble" at the moment.
He said Wales had an interest in the border between the north and south of Ireland because of Wales' maritime border with the Republic.
Mr Jones warned a "seamless" border between north and south, twinned with customs checks at Welsh ports, could provide an incentive for trade to avoid Welsh ports.
Freight operators could "go through Cairnryan in Scotland, go through Liverpool and go to Northern Ireland then down rather than mess about in Holyhead, Fishguard and Pembroke", he warned.
"So there are job losses there if we're not careful."

The only England players in the top 10 are Tottenham duo Harry Kane (worth £122m) and Dele Alli (£96m).
Paul Pogba, who joined Manchester United for a record £89m in the summer, is worth £136.4m.
The study has been carried out by a team of academics from the CIES Football Observatory, using a transfer value algorithm.
They have calculated the value using criteria that includes player performance and characteristics, such as age and length of contract.
Cristiano Ronaldo, the Ballon d'Or winner and Fifa's world's best player, is seventh on the list at £111m, with Real Madrid team-mate Gareth Bale 14th and valued at £73.8m, less than the £85.3m he cost the La Liga side in 2013.
Pogba is the only player in the top five not based in Spain, with Atletico Madrid's Antoine Griezmann third at £132m and Barcelona's Luis Suarez fifth (£127m).

Article: The experimental aircraft, which has a wingspan bigger than a jumbo but weighs little more than a large car, left Nanjing at 02:39 (18:39 GMT).
It is likely to take Mr Borschberg five to six days of continuous flight to reach his central Pacific destination.
He will try to stay awake for much of that time, taking only short catnaps.
His progress will be monitored the entire way from a control room in Monaco.
Meteorologists and flight strategists will constantly update him on the best route to follow.
The journey is the seventh leg in the single-seat, propeller-driven aircraft's quest to circumnavigate the globe using just the energy of the Sun.
The project made steady progress after starting out from Abu Dhabi in March, but was held up for more than a month on China's east coast waiting for the right weather conditions over the ocean.
Solar Impulse needs not only favourable winds to help push it forward, but also clear skies to enable its 17,000 wing-mounted photovoltaic cells to achieve peak performance.
These cells must have the vehicle's lithium-ion batteries fully topped up at dusk to sustain flying through to dawn the next day.
Mr Borschberg is a highly experienced pilot, and as a trained engineer is completely familiar with the plane's systems.
Nonetheless, he is in no doubt how tough the mission will be.
"It's more in the end about myself; it's going to be an inner-voyage," he told the BBC before departure.
"It's going to be a discovery about how I feel and how I sustain myself during these five or six days in the air."
And Bertrand Piccard - who has flown Solar Impulse on other stages of the voyage - told the BBC: "There's one pilot at a time, so the pilot needs to do everything on his own. And it's a very large aeroplane, big wingspans, sensitive to turbulence, flying quite slow.
"So sometimes it's difficult to handle when the air moves. But we have an auto-pilot, we have toilets on board, we have food for days, water reserves and everything, and we are well trained."
The distance to Kalaeloa airport on Hawaii's O'ahu island is more than 8,000km (5,000 miles).
If, early on in the flight, the weather turns bad or he encounters a major technical problem, Mr Borschberg can always choose to turn around and head back to China or Japan.
But there will come a point where that option is denied to him, and Mr Borschberg and his support team have had to prepare for the possibility of ditching in the Pacific if something goes seriously wrong.
The pilot himself would not go down with the plane because of the risk of electrocution once in the water. Instead, he would bail out with a dinghy and wait for a ship to come and pick him up.
If he succeeds in reaching Kalaeloa airport, he will set several aviation records - not least the longest-duration journey for a single-seater plane.
The purpose of the Solar Impulse project is not really to showcase a particular kind of future for aviation, but rather to demonstrate the potential of clean technologies more generally.

Article: Keith Towler said there was little regulation and control of bullying on social networking sites.
A survey suggested over a third of 11 to 17-year olds in Wales who had been bullied had suffered cyberbullying.
The Welsh government said it was better to develop respectful relationships than criminalise bullying.
Cyber-bullying has been highlighted in the media in recent months after the death of 14-year-old Hannah Smith, from Leicestershire.
She killed herself, according to her family, because she was bullied on the social networking site ask.fm.
Under UK legislation there is not a specific law which makes cyberbullying illegal, although it can be considered a criminal offence under legislation such as the Protection from Harassment Act and the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act.
Mr Towler said he believed legislation specifically to deal with cyber-bullying was now needed.
"What we are trying to cope with is an ever-changing world," he told BBC Wales' Welsh language Taro 9 programme.
"We're trying to run to catch up to something that is actually way out there and it is way out there without very much regulation or control, and do we need to wrestle back some control of this so that it is safe? Yes we do."
He told the programme: "I think we need to think about legislation, we need to think about guidance, we need to think about the roles of schools, what is the role of parents and carers, enabling children and young people to empower themselves so that they can take some responsibility for their own safety.
Ysgol y Cymer in Porth, Rhondda Cynon Taf, is one school taking a pro-active approach to try to stop its pupils becoming victims of cyberbullying.
Under a scheme called Cymer Ofal, pupils are able to give advice to other younger pupils on Bullying and cyber-bullying.
One counsellor, Lowri Mitchinson, 16, who was bullied on ask.fm, said her experience could be used to help others.
"Some people don't see teachers as real people who actually care for you. But maybe if someone who has been in their shoes gives them advice then they might listen a bit more," she said.
"I've had the experience myself so they won't just ignore me - they'll know she's been through this, she can help me with this.
"People used to call me anorexic - I wasn't but that could have hurt me so much, and maybe cause me to put weight on or lose it."
"All of those things need to happen."
Olivia Edwards, 15, from Treorchy in Rhondda Cynon Taf, was bullied last year on ask.fm but did not know who the perpetrators were because the comments were posted anonymously.
"I had to read stuff like 'kill yourself' and 'you're anorexic' and stuff like 'you're not pretty'," she said.
"It just really upset me a lot and I started to believe it. It wasn't a good idea to start believing stuff like that."
The bullying ended after two months but she said anyone suffering like she did should delete their accounts on the site.
When asked to respond to the points raised in the Taro 9 programme, ask.fm said in a statement: "We are committed to doing everything we can to protect our users.
"We are working with the pre-eminent online child safety expert Annie Mullins OBE to review and update our safety and privacy policies.
"This will ensure that our abuse and inappropriate content reporting systems are among the most effective in the industry."
The site is also asking users to report any bullying, insisting that complaints will be "dealt with immediately".
A recent survey of nearly 1,000 children and young people in Wales by the Children and Young People's Assembly for Wales: Funky Dragon - an umbrella organisation promoting the rights of young people - appeared to show the scale of cyberbullying.
We're talking about online bullying and that's a situation where a person and in some instances a group of people use emails, the internet or any kind of digital technology to bully someone.
It could involve teasing, upsetting or humiliating and the thing is with this sort of bullying it's there 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
There was a time when you could say bullying ended at the school gate but that's not the case any more.
The other thing about online bullying is that you don't always know who's responsible because it can be done anonymously and there are examples of people setting up fake accounts and hiding their IP address or even blocking their mobile number.
Parents need to be aware of what their children are doing online, understand what they're doing and make sure their children are happy to talk to them if there's a problem with bullying.
Some 47% said they had been bullied and 37% of those said that they had suffered from cyberbullying.
It also suggested it was more of a problem among girls, with 43.8% reporting it compared with 27.4% of boys.
Responding to the call for legislation, the Welsh government said developing positive and respectful relationships would be a better approach.
"We have published Respecting Others, a suite of comprehensive anti-bullying guidance which includes a specific section on cyberbullying," a spokesperson said.
"The guidance gives details of schools' legal responsibilities while providing them with information they need to create effective strategies for tackling bullying.
"There are already a number of criminal laws that can apply in terms of harassment or threatening behaviour, including threatening and menacing communications.
"Rather than criminalise bullying the focus should be on developing positive and respectful relationships amongst children and young people."
Taro 9 is broadcast at 21:30 BST on S4C on Tuesday with English subtitles.

Legislation should be brought in to deal with the problem of cyberbullying, according to the children's commissioner for Wales.

Article: Yvonne Mosquito, the West Midlands Deputy PCC, was suspended after visiting a murder victim's family without informing officers.
Following a disciplinary in May 2016, Ms Mosquito had an employment tribunal listed to take place in May 2017.
A joint statement said "all outstanding matters" were resolved.
A BBC source said Ms Mosquito had received a payout. The Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner said it would not comment on whether money had exchanged hands.
Allegations against Ms Mosquito related to a visit she paid to the family of Kenichi Phillips, 18, who was shot dead in a car in Birmingham, on 17 March 2016.
Police and Crime Commissioner David Jamieson said her actions "caused ongoing upset and distress" and "damaged the relationship" between the family and police "in the middle of a complex and sensitive murder investigation".
Her supporters insisted she visited as an ordained minister who wanted to offer condolences to relatives.
Her union Unite rejected the allegations, saying it was "deplorable" the hearing went ahead in Ms Mosquito's absence.
She was issued with a final written warning and her contract was never renewed.
The BBC previously reported Ms Mosquito wrote a letter of complaint about the PCC's behaviour towards her, of which the PCC was aware, four weeks before her suspension.
A joint statement issued by the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) and Ms Mosquito said they were "happy to announce that they have amicably settled all outstanding matters between them".
"Litigation is a stressful business and the parties acknowledge and regret the effects that inevitably follow from that," it added.
The former colleagues thanked each other for their work around issues of equality, the statement added.

Some estimates put Lagos' population at around 20 million, creating a constant background of noise - from the blaring of car horns, to the Muslim call to prayer and loud singing in churches.
The state government has vowed to make the city, the biggest in Africa, noise-free by 2020.
Africa Live: More on this and other news stories
In August, the Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency (LEPA) closed 22 premises after residents complained about noise emanating from them.
Following the latest crackdown, its general manager Bola Shabi said the agency would no longer allow people to pray in makeshift buildings and tents.
Mr Shabi said noise levels had been reduced by about 35%, but this was not a "pass mark yet".
"Enforcement is a continuous exercise and we have set a target for ourselves. We want to ensure that Lagos is noise-free by the year 2020," he said.
Mr Shabi said mosques complied with their instructions more than churches because when they are ordered to shut down, they "instantly bring down their speakers or reduce the noise they make''.
Nigerians are extremely religious, with a large number of evangelical churches operating in Lagos.
Christians form the majority in the city.
In 2014, 116 people died when a building owned by popular televangelist TB Joshua collapsed in Lagos.

Article: The 6ft 5in star had been diagnosed with brain cancer and was in intensive care in New York before his death on Wednesday.
His son Rory said in a statement: "He was full of knowledge and kindness and goodness.
"He always wanted to share the great and beautiful things in life."
Herrmann played the beloved grandfather Richard Gilmore on Gilmore Girls, a waspish family drama set in a storybook Connecticut town.
Lauren Graham, who played Herrmann's on-screen daughter Lorelai Gilmore during the show's seven series, remembered the actor as the "kindest, classiest, most talented man" and said it was a "devastating blow to lose him".
"Ed Herrmann's combination of pure charisma plus his distinctive voice lit up any room he entered," she added.
"He had a gentlemanly manner, a wicked sense of humour, and a sharp wit. He was well-read, interesting, and just plain fun to be around."
Kelly Bishop, who played his wife Emily Gilmore, said she was "somewhat stunned" by his death, having only found out he was ill a few weeks ago.
"I think everyone who knew or worked with Ed found him to be absolutely delightful," she said in a statement. "Everything looks a little dim, as if the lights went down."
The actor, who trained at London's Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, was singled out for praise when Entertainment Weekly picked Gilmore Girls as one of its "new TV classics" in 2009.
Describing him as an "on-screen pro", it said he could "advise, hector, and soothe with debonair slyness".
But his son, Rory, said his father's favourite role had been US President Franklin D Roosevelt, whom he played in the TV movies Eleanor and Franklin and Eleanor and Franklin: The Whitehouse Years in 1976 and 1977.
The actor reprised the role in the 1982 movie musical Annie, and provided the voice for FDR in Ken Burns' documentary series The Roosevelts: An Intimate History, last year.
Herrmann also starred in Joel Schumacher's teen vampire film, The Lost Boys, alongside Kiefer Sutherland, where he played Max; and won a primetime Emmy in 1999 for his guest role in the Boston-based legal series The Practice.
His Broadway credits included the original run of Love Letters in 1989, The Deep Blue Sea with Blythe Danner in 1998 and George Bernard Shaw's Mrs Warren's Profession, for which he won a Tony Award in 1976.
He often appeared on the big screen in major films including The Wolf of Wall Street, The Aviator and Reds, and recently appeared on shows such as Grey's Anatomy, How I Met Your Mother and The Good Wife.
His manager Robbie Kass said in a statement: "Besides being an accomplished actor, [Herrmann] was also a true gentleman and a scholar, as well as being incredibly kind and decent man. He will be sorely missed."
Herrmann was surrounded by his family including his wife, Star, and three children when he died.

Article: "Maduro won't be ousted by a referendum because there will be no referendum," Mr Isturiz said.
Opposition politicians began the process two weeks ago by handing in a petition signed by 1.85 million people.
Meanwhile, the government has published details of the state of emergency it declared on Friday.
It said the emergency would last for 60 days and could then be extended for another 60.
Mr Isturiz said the opposition had "acted too late" over the recall referendum, had "done it wrong and had committed fraud".
The opposition have previously warned the referendum may be hard to push through, as they alleged that the National Electoral Council (CNE) is staffed by government loyalists.
Many Venezuelans blame Mr Maduro for the economic crisis the country is experiencing.
Its economy contracted by 5.7% last year and is expected to shrink further this year. Inflation is at 180%, according to official figures, and there are shortages of medicines and basic food items.
On Friday, President Maduro declared a state of emergency to "denounce, neutralise and overcome the external and foreign aggressions against our country", which he blames for Venezuela's economic problems.
In measures published in the government gazette on Monday, the armed forces and local committees will now have powers to distribute and sell food.
Authorities will also be allowed to cut the working week in the private sector, as they have done in the public sector, to conserve electricity.
The new measures also allow the government to take control of basic goods or services, which analysts say opens the way to the expropriation of companies.
On 2 May, opposition politicians handed in 80 boxes containing 1.85 million signatures to the CNE, well above the 1% of voters on the electoral roll needed to kick-start the process.
Opposition politicians say the authorities are trying to stall the process and have called on their supporters to march to the offices of the CNE on Wednesday to demand they verify the signatures so the process can go ahead.
The timing of a potential recall referendum is key because the outcome could be radically different depending on when it is held.
Under Venezuela's constitution, if President Maduro were to be removed by a recall referendum in his last two years in office, he would be replaced by his Vice-President, Mr Isturiz.
But if Mr Maduro were to be recalled before that, new elections would be triggered.
The opposition sees it as essential to have new elections rather than have Mr Isturiz take power, as he is seen as a loyal member of Mr Maduro's Socialist Unity Party.
For new elections to be held, the recall referendum would have to go against Mr Maduro before 10 January 2017.

Venezuela's Vice-President Aristobulo Isturiz has ruled out the possibility of a recall referendum being held against President Nicolas Maduro.

Winger Niall McGinn also netted as Northern Ireland recovered from their opening defeat by Poland to remain in contention for a place in the last 16.
"People had written us off, nobody gave us a chance," said defender McAuley. "It's a very special moment.
"We weren't at it against Poland and we wanted to put it right."
Media playback is not supported on this device
The 36-year-old West Brom player became the second-oldest goalscorer at a European Championship by putting Northern Ireland ahead with a 49th-minute header, before substitute McGinn added the second in injury time.
It was Northern Ireland's first victory at a major tournament finals in 34 years - since beating hosts Spain at the 1982 World Cup - and the result means Michael O'Neill's side can still progress as a best third-placed team at least.
They face Germany in their final Group C game and, with Ukraine having been eliminated, Northern Ireland will qualify for the knockout stages with a win in Paris on Tuesday.
"We let ourselves down against Poland in terms of the intensity we wanted to play at so we had a point to prove to ourselves," said McAuley.
"It was a wonderful team performance and we are delighted for everyone, especially the supporters.
"We have something to play for in our last game against Germany, which is what we wanted. We can take a lot of confidence into that game."

O'Neill made five changes for his side's second group game, including leaving striker Kyle Lafferty on the bench, and the Northern Ireland boss acknowledge it was a gamble.
"There was some risk attached to changing the team but it was a fantastic performance from the entire side," said the 46-year-old.
"I couldn't have asked any more. The players gave every last ounce of passion and energy and the supporters were magnificent - everything that is good about Northern Ireland was in that stadium.
"We have given ourselves a great chance of finishing third and we will try to nick a point, maybe more, against the Germans.

Article: Cuadrilla, the firm behind the tests, said drilling had been suspended as a precaution after the 1.5 magnitude tremor - the second in two months.
It will now examine the data collected by the British Geological Survey (BGS) before deciding whether to resume.
A tremor centred on Poulton-le-Fylde on 1 April shared a "similar location and mechanism", the BSG said.
Shale gas drilling, known as "fracking", involves shattering hard shale rocks underground to release gas using either hydraulic pressure or tiny explosions.
Mark Miller, chief executive of Cuadrilla Resources, said: "We take our responsibilities very seriously and that is why we have stopped fracking operations to share information and consult with the relevant authorities and other experts.
"We expect that this analysis and subsequent consultation will take a number of weeks to conclude and we will decide on appropriate actions after that."
The process has proved controversial in the US with environmentalists alleging that shale gas leaking into their drinking supply could cause tap water to ignite.
But earlier this month the Commons energy select committee called on ministers to support the process in the UK arguing that environmental problems associated with it in the US could be overcome by tight regulation and good industry practice.
The BGS said it was also monitoring fracking as a precaution. There have been two small earthquakes in Lancashire since fracking began in the county in March, including the latest on Friday.
In an analysis of the April quake published on its website the BGS said: "Any process that injects pressurised water into rocks at depth will cause the rock to fracture and possibly produce earthquakes.
"It is well known that injection of water or other fluids during the oil extraction and geothermal engineering, such as Shale gas, processes can result in earthquake activity."
The BGS said the April tremor took place 1.2 miles (2km) away from the drilling site but said its monitoring instruments were 50 miles (80km) away.
Speaking about the latest quake, Dr Brian Baptie, head of seismology at the BGS, said: "The earthquake was felt by at least one person in Poulton-Le-Fylde.
"Our analysis places the epicentre of the event to within 2km of the Preese Hall site.
"Data from two temporary instruments close to the drill site, installed after the magnitude 2.3 earthquake on 1 April, indicate that the event occurred at a depth of approximately 2km (1.2 miles).
"The recorded waveforms are very similar to those from the magnitude 2.3 event last month, which suggests that the two events share a similar location and mechanism."

Shale gas test drilling in Lancashire has been suspended following an earthquake on the Fylde coast.

Article: Two separate proceedings, one by a cross-party group of MLAs and another from victims' campaigner Raymond McCord, were heard earlier this month.
A judge ruled there was nothing in the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement to prevent the government triggering Article 50, the formal legal process for leaving the EU.
The UK government welcomed the ruling.
Mr McCord said that "without a doubt" he would be taking his case to the Supreme Court.
"The judge has left the door open," he said.
"We're right in what we're doing for the people of this country."
The challenge by politicians from Sinn FÃ©in, the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), the Alliance Party and the Green Party suggested the UK government could not trigger Article 50 without a parliamentary vote.
They said the Brexit decision should be examined and voted on by parliament or, failing that, by the Northern Ireland Assembly.
Earlier this month, the High Court in London heard that the need for parliament to give its approval before the Brexit process starts is of huge "constitutional importance".
Mr McCord, whose son was murdered by loyalist paramilitaries and who now campaigns for victims of violence during Northern Ireland's Troubles, brought Friday's other legal bid.
His challenge came amid worries that the Brexit vote could mean an end to EU funding for peace projects that help Troubles victims.
His lawyer argued that the Good Friday Agreement meant Westminster had given sovereignty of Northern Ireland over to its people, and that leaving the EU would have a "catastrophic effect" for the peace process.
Major constitutional changes such as leaving the EU could not therefore be imposed by a Westminster government, Mr McCord's barrister said.
But the judge ruled that prerogative power could still be used, arguing that triggering Article 50 is merely the start of a legislative process in which acts of parliament will be necessary.
"While the wind of change may be about to blow, the precise direction in which it will blows cannot be determined," he said.
He concluded that discussing the use of prerogative power to enact the EU referendum result was not suitable for a judicial review.
It had also been argued that the Good Friday Agreement gave the power of sovereignty to the people of Northern Ireland and that the Westminster government could not therefore make the region leave the EU.
But the judge rejected that argument as well, saying he could not see anything in the agreement or the relevant legislation that confirmed that view.
All of the issues raised by the applicants were rejected by the court.
The pound dropped in the wake of the ruling, with analysts speculating that it had weighed on the currency.
Sinn FÃ©in's John O'Down said Remain-supporting politicians would "continue to explore every legal and political option open to us" to ensure that citizens' rights are "protected and upheld".
SDLP leader Colum Eastwood acknowledged that the cost of taking the case to the Supreme Court could be an issue.
But he added: "We believe very, very strongly that Brexit would have a hugely detrimental effect on people here," he said.
"It would be a huge constitutional shock to people and to the political process here."
Remaining within the EU would give Troubles victims a better chance of getting justice, Mr McCord said.
"The British government have no interest in victims," he added.
Mr McCord's barrister Ciaran O'Hare said the judgement was "no surprise" and they welcomed the ruling.
"It is a very important constitutional case and it will have to dealt with in the Supreme Court," he said.
Welcoming the ruling, a government spokesman said: "As we have always made clear, we stand by our commitments under the Belfast Agreement and the outcome of the EU referendum doesn't change this."
The case has been closely watched by Westminster, especially as similar hearings are due for judgement in the near future.

Article: A Ray Winstone-like voice is programmed to say "Don't even think about it" and "Put it down, put it back" as soon as the card is removed from the bag.
Rebecca Smith, Leanne Fischler and Kirsty Sneddon created the bag for a degree project.
The fourth-year students said the design was "very conceptual".
All three are in their final year at Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design in Dundee.
The bag - designed to be a "unisex satchel" - has all the electronics hidden inside a false bottom.
A slot has been sewn in for a credit card which conceals an led light and a sensor which acts as a trigger to play the voice recordings.
Ms Fischler, 21, said: "As soon as you take the credit card out, it sends a signal and inside the bag we have a whole load of electronics which we coded ourselves using a platform called Arduino.
"It receives a signal when you take the credit card out and it tells the circuit board that the credit card's moved and it starts to play sequences from our recordings."
The students said at first the bag tried to deter you from spending money, saying things like "Don't you think that's a bit much?" and "Oh, not again". After a while the bag assumes you have made the purchase and starts to "publicly embarrass you".
However, if you put the credit card back right away it rewards you with a gruff: "I knew you could 'ear me".
Ms Smith, 21, told BBC Scotland they had been asked to make a project with an "element of whispering".
She said they had designed the bag as a concept, rather than hoping it would be manufactured for the mass-market.
"We're all passionate about using design to create change and starting conversations," she said.
"We want people to see it and interact with it."

Aaron Barley, 23, of no fixed address, has been charged with their murders and with the attempted murder of Mr Wilkinson.
Lydia, who was at university at the time 50-year-old Tracey and 13-year-old Pierce were stabbed, spoke of her devastation.
Mrs Wilkinson was pronounced dead at the scene. Pierce died in hospital after paramedics battled to save him.

Article: Matthew Todd Miller, a 24-year-old US citizen, was sentenced to six years of hard labour on 14 September 2014 for what state media described as "hostile acts" against North Korea.
He had been in custody since 10 April when, according to North Korean sources, he destroyed his tourist visa and demanded asylum.
The youngest of four sons, he grew up in Bakersfield, California, and both his parents were oil engineers.
Described by former classmates as "quiet but extremely intelligent", he learnt Korean on his first trip to South Korea four years ago while visiting a brother stationed there with the US air force.  A California neighbour said he liked it so much he stayed.
Notes produced in court, apparently in Mr Miller's handwriting, suggested he had become a fugitive because he was involved with Wikileaks, the organisation that leaked US state secrets.
However, the BBC's Stephen Evans in Seoul says it is unclear if they were written under duress or not, and if any of the allegations were true.
In an interview this month with CNN, attended by North Korean officials, Mr Miller said: "I will say that I prepared to violate the law of the DPRK before coming here."
He also said he deliberately committed his "crime", without specifying what he had done wrong.
The charges he faced in trial were non-specified.
Mr Bae, a Korean-American known in North Korea as Pae Jun-ho, was arrested in November 2012 as he entered the north-eastern port city of Rason, a special economic zone near North Korea's border with China.
He has been described as both a tour operator and Christian missionary. North Korea said he used his tourism business to form groups to overthrow the government.
He was sentenced to 15 years' hard labour in May 2013.
Mr Bae's trial and conviction came at a time of high tension between the US and North Korea, in the wake of the communist state's third nuclear test. So far efforts to secure his release have been unsuccessful.
His family say he has several health complaints including diabetes and liver problems.
Jeffrey Edward Fowle: June 2014 - October 2014
Jeffrey Fowle entered North Korea on 29 April and was detained as he was leaving the country some time between mid-May and early June, according to reports.
He is a 56-year-old US citizen from Miamisburg, Ohio, who works for the city.
The father of three came into the country as a tourist but, according to reports, left a Bible in his hotel room - something the North considers incendiary.
He was facing a trial for non-specified charges but was released following negotiations and returned to the US in October 2014.
Mr Jun, a businessman, was arrested in November 2010 for an unspecified "grave crime", and detained in North Korea for six months.
It was reported that he may have been involved in missionary work during business trips to North Korea.
The communist state views organised religious activity as a potential challenge to its leadership.
North Korean state media said that he had confessed to wrongdoing, and that he was treated well in custody, being allowed diplomatic contact and family phone calls.
Visiting US officials repeatedly requested his release, including Robert King, the US special envoy for human rights, who was visiting North Korea to assess its food situation.
During Mr King's visit, the North agreed to free Mr Jun on "humanitarian grounds".
Mr Jun was flown out with Mr King's delegation.
The US had suspended its food aid to North Korea in 2009 amid concerns over the North's nuclear programme, and Mr King stressed that Pyongyang had not been promised aid in return for Mr King's release.
Aijalon Mahli Gomes, 31, was sentenced to eight years' hard labour for illegally entering North Korea from China in 2010.
He had been teaching English in South Korea, but reportedly crossed into North Korea in January 2010. He was arrested in April that year.
Mr Gomes, a devout Christian, was thought to have gone to North Korea on a one-man peace mission.
North Korean media said he tried to commit suicide while in detention.
Mr Gomes' detention came during a period of heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula.
In March 2010, South Korea's Cheonan warship sank, killing 46 sailors. International investigators said that the vessel had been sunk by a North Korean torpedo, something Pyongyang denied.
Soon afterwards, the US and South Korea took part in joint military drills, sparking anger from North Korea.
Six-party talks aimed at ending North Korea's nuclear programme had also been stalled for several months.
Former US President Jimmy Carter secured Mr Gomes' release during a "private humanitarian trip" to North Korea in August 2010.
During his trip, he met North Korean officials, including ceremonial head of state Kim Yong-nam.
North Korean media said that Kim Yong-nam expressed North Korea's commitment to resuming six-party negotiations on its nuclear programme, during his talks with Mr Carter.
US Christian activist Robert Park entered North Korea on 25 December 2009, carrying a letter for then-North Korean leader Kim Jong-il.
He crossed into North Korea from China by walking over a frozen river. He was arrested almost instantly.
He told the BBC he had decided to make the trip because his conscience had been tormented by the thought of people suffering in North Korea.
He said he was tortured while in custody.
In February, North Korea said it had decided to "forgive and release" Mr Park.
North Korean media said he confessed to crossing the border, and agreed that his view of North Korea was based on false reports.
He now realised that religious freedom was ensured in North Korea, North Korea's main news agency added - something his colleagues described as "propaganda".
Laura Ling and Euna Lee, reporters for California-based Current TV, were jailed for illegally entering North Korea and sentenced to 12 years' hard labour.
They had been filming a video about North Korean refugees, and admitted to entering North Korea for a short time, but said they were on the Chinese side of the border when they were arrested.
"We were firmly back inside China when the soldiers apprehended us," they said.
"We tried with all our might to cling to bushes, ground, anything that would keep us on Chinese soil, but we were no match for the determined soldiers."
They said it was possible that they had been lured into a trap.
Their detention took place during a period of high tensions between Pyongyang and Washington. In April, North Korea dropped out of six-party denuclearisation talks, and in May, it said it had successfully completed its second nuclear test.
The two journalists were issued with a special pardon after former US President Bill Clinton visited Pyongyang, and returned to Los Angeles on a chartered flight with Mr Clinton.
Official North Korean reports said that Mr Clinton had apologised on behalf of the US for the actions of the two reporters - something denied by the US, who said Mr Clinton carried no message to North Korea.
Correspondents said that it appeared that the women had been held in relative comfort in a guest house for most of their time in North Korea, and been used by North Korea as a diplomatic tool to secure a visit by a high-profile US envoy.

But a statement from the school says the school did not segregate, but was respecting the governor's choice.
A wave of Ofsted inspections found nine private faith schools "inadequate".
Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw had written on Tuesday to Education Secretary Nicky Morgan with the findings of inspections of 22 private faith schools, in cities including Manchester, Coventry, Birmingham and Leicester.
These had formerly been inspected by an independent group - the Bridge Schools Inspectorate - but from this autumn Ofsted has taken over responsibility for carrying out checks.
Religious studies GCSE 'error of law'
Inspectors raised concerns including that some of these private faith schools were not "promoting fundamental British values" and were not encouraging "mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs".
They highlighted particular concern about Darul Uloom Islamic High School in Birmingham, where inspectors observed that "the only female governor sat out of sight of the male governors in an adjacent room to the main meeting.
"As a result, she could only contribute to the meeting through a doorway. Governors told inspectors this was their usual arrangement.
"A senior HMI has pointed out to the school that this practice is unacceptable as it fails to show proper respect for women."
In response, a statement from the school says that visitors, parents and governors can "sit where and how they wish as they feel comfortable, and we never assert any restrictions on this".
The private boys' schools says it has an "open door policy" and has hosted meetings including for a local faith forum and for the West Midlands police.
The school issued a statement from the unnamed governor saying that "my request to sit as I please" was a way of "demonstrating the school's strong promotion of both Islamic and British values".
"The right for a person to choose is a universal value," she said. But she claimed that the "British values" requirement was opposed to this.
Darul Uloom, now rated as inadequate, had been inspected by Ofsted inspectors since 2011. In October 2013, Ofsted rated it as good and described the head teacher as "forward thinking".
Ofsted says that although its own inspectors carried out a number of inspections in recent years, the school was considered to have been part of the BSI inspection system.
Among the 22 schools inspected 15 were Muslim and seven Christian.
They had been part of a group of about 50 private schools which had been assessed by the Bridge Schools Inspectorate, which now is no longer approved to inspect schools.
Among the 22 schools inspected by Ofsted, one was "outstanding", four were rated "good", eight were rated as "requires improvement" and nine were "inadequate".
Sir Michael's letter to the education secretary says it should be a priority to inspect other former Bridge Schools Inspectorate schools.

The female governor at a private Muslim school in Birmingham - at the centre of criticism from Ofsted - chose to sit separately from men, says the school.

Article: Students said the error meant there were two possible correct answers to the multiple choice questions.
Officials have said they will accept two answers as correct in each case, and the head of the national exam board has offered to resign.
The annual test determines the academic futures of high school students.
South Korean media said the mistake would affect the test scores of about 3,600-4,000 students.
"I express deep regret and recognise an urgent need to improve the question-making process," Education Minister Hwang Woo-Yea said in a statement broadcast on television.
"We will investigate the root cause of the problem," Mr Hwang said.
About 640,000 students sat the nine-hour standardised test, called the College Scholastic Ability Test, on 13 November at 1,216 testing sites across the country, South Korea's Yonhap news agency said.
Many students engage in intense studying for years in preparation for the exam, often with the involvement of their parents in what is an extremely competitive academic environment.
A good score would mean a spot in one of South Korea's top universities.
The suspect multiple-choice questions, one in the biology exam and one in the English language paper, sparked an uproar with parents and students complaining to the website of the Korea Institute for Curriculum and Evaluation (KICE) which administers the exam.
Last year's exam was also controversial because of a mistake in one of the questions in the world geology section.
After a year-long legal battle, Seoul High Court ruled in favour of four students who said the question was flawed.
"We did our best this year to prevent erroneous questions... but again there were faulty questions, causing chaos and inconvenience among exam takers, their parents and teachers," said Kim Sung-Hoon, head of KICE.

Article: Figures indicate that 15% of people were very concerned while 37% were fairly concerned, about their spending.
The average cost in the area is expected to be £497.23, the highest after North Yorkshire at £508.82.
The figures also suggest 13% of people could resort to borrowing, more than twice the level in other areas.
Across the county, North Derbyshire and Lincolnshire, 50% of people surveyed for the BBC said they were concerned about their festive spending.
Concern is highest amongst those aged 18-34 and those with children under 18.
Jane Symonds, money expert at the Money Advice Service, said: "Christmas can be an expensive time of year, but it's important to know that you don't have to live beyond your means to make it a fun time. A big financial hangover is the last thing anyone wants to start the new year with.
"Planning ahead by looking carefully at costs will help you to take control of your spending and reduce some of the pressure. It's best to avoid credit if you can, but if you need to borrow there are more options if you think ahead."
Across all the areas surveyed, of those planning to borrow 68% said they would use their credit card, 18% plan to ask friends and family for help, 18% will use their overdraft, 6% will go to a pay day lender, 6% will take out a loan, and 2% say they will go to a credit union.
On average people said they expected to borrow about £180.
On average, men said they were likely to borrow £214.76 while women said they expected to borrow about £146.36.
More than half of all borrowers said it would take them between a few weeks to a year to repay their debt.
Kevin Peachey, personal finance reporter, BBC News
Financial advisers say it is never too late to draw up a budget for your Christmas spending.
Those who get into trouble often forget to factor in those little extras that add to the festive bill.
So, as well as presents, food and travel, advisers urge families not to ignore the cost of replacing decorations, calling relatives and even taking the children to Santa's grotto.
They suggest shopping around on the internet for all these things to get the best deal.
Those who turn to credit may be deferring the pain, but missing repayments in the new year could start or continue a debt spiral that may be difficult to pull out of.
Instead, advisers say, keep things under control this year, and start saving now to bring some Christmas 2015 cheer to your family and your finances.
Market research agency ComRes interviewed 1,270 people across Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, of which 501 were in West Yorkshire, 305 were in South Yorkshire and North Derbyshire, 335 in North Yorkshire, 179 in East Yorkshire and northern Lincolnshire and 189 in Lincolnshire.
The online survey was carried out for BBC Radio Sheffield between 27 November and 1 December.

Article: Monarchs are the only insects to migrate such a vast distance.
So, by teaming up with biologists, mathematicians set out to recreate the internal compass they use to navigate on that journey.
The findings are published in the journal Cell Reports.
Lead researcher Prof Eli Shlizerman, from the University of Washington, explained that, as a mathematician, he wants to know how neurobiological systems are wired and what rules we can learn from them.
"Monarch butterflies [complete their journey] in such an optimal, predetermined way," he told BBC News.
"They end up in a particular location in Central Mexico after two months of flight, saving energy and only using a few cues."
Prof Shlizerman worked with biologist colleagues, including Steven Reppert at the University of Massachusetts, to record directly from neurons in the butterflies' antennae and eyes.
"We identified that the input cues depend entirely on the Sun," explained Prof Shlizerman.
"One is the horizontal position of the Sun and the other is keeping the time of day.
"This gives [the insects] an internal Sun compass for travelling southerly throughout the day."
Having worked out the inputs for this internal compass, Prof Shlizerman then created a model system to simulate it.
This consisted of two control mechanisms - one based on the timekeeping "clock" neurons in the butterflies' antennae and the other from what are called azimuth neurons in their eyes. These monitor the position of the Sun.
"The circuit gets those two signals then matches them, according to how it's wired, to control signals that tell the system if a correction is needed to stay on the correct course," explained Prof Shlizerman.
"For me this is very exciting - it shows how a behaviour is produced by the integration of signals," he added.
"We can take these concepts to produce robotic versions of these systems - something [that is] powered by and that navigates by the Sun."
Prof Shlizerman said that one of his team's goals was to build a robotic monarch butterfly that could follow the insects and track their entire migration.
"It's a very interesting application that could follow the butterflies and even help maintain them.
"Their numbers are decreasing, so we want to keep this insect - the only one that migrates these huge distances - with us for many years."
Prof Matthew Cobb from the University of Manchester told BBC News that the study showed that "something as astounding as the monarch migration can be understood in terms of cellular circuitry".
"Our current robots are far cruder than even the simplest nervous system," he added.

Article: In July, Conor McGinn, who is from south Armagh, claimed the Labour leader suggested phoning his father.
It followed an interview in which he called for Mr Corbyn to "reach out beyond his comfort zone".
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said at the time that it was "untrue".
The St Helens MP told BBC Radio Four's Westminster Hour: "The modus operandi that he (Mr Corbyn) and the people around him were trying to do, involving my family, was to isolate and ostracise me from them and from the community I am very proud to come from -  which is an Irish, nationalist community in south Armagh."
The MP claimed that after he spoke out about Mr Corbyn in May, he got a call from the Labour whips' office saying the party leader had initially asked for his resignation and then considered sacking him.
But subsequently, through his spokesman, he had asked for an apology and retraction, which Mr McGinn refused to make.
The MP said he then texted the Labour leader to make clear no offence was intended and reiterate that their friendship was important to him and asking for a meeting.
He received no response, but said he was then informed by the whips' office that Mr Corbyn had proposed asking the MP's father, Pat, to intervene.

"Berra is the best defender in the league, for me, without a doubt," McCarthy told BBC Radio Suffolk.
"He's just outstanding, he's big and powerful and wins it in the air, he's quick, he blocks things and is good at defending corners."
Berra has impressed alongside youngster Adam Webster at the centre of Ipswich's defence this season, and McCarthy has previously said Webster will go onto play in the Premier League.
The pair played on Tuesday against Burton as Town ended a winless run of five matches and McCarthy's side travel to leaders Newcastle United on Saturday.
Former Republic of Ireland boss McCarthy said he was impressed by the signings the Magpies made following their relegation to the Championship, such as Matt Ritchie from Bournemouth and Dwight Gayle from Crystal Palace.
"They went out and got players who know the Championship, don't mind playing in the Championship, all want to be out of the Championship again and probably think they can be.

Article: Turkish forces have targeted so-called Islamic State (IS) inside Syria, but have also gone after Kurdish fighters in the same region.
The pursuit of Kurdish forces, whom Ankara considers terrorists, has led to criticism by the United States.
Ankara contacted the US ambassador on Wednesday over comments the foreign ministry called "unacceptable".
A US military spokesman had expressed hopes on Tuesday that, rather than see Turkey pursue Kurdish fighters, "all parties involved are going to stop shooting at each other and focus" on IS.
On Wednesday, Russia added its voice, with the foreign affairs ministry calling on Turkey to avoid strikes in Syria on opposition and ethnic groups fighting Islamic State, including Syrian Kurds.
"Turkey is a sovereign state, it is a legitimate state," said Turkey's EU Affairs Minister Omer Celik.
"To suggest it is on a par with a terrorist organisation and suggest there are talks between them, that a deal has been reached between them, this is unacceptable."
Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said on Wednesday that "operations will continue until all terrorist elements have been neutralised, until all threats to our borders, our lands and our citizens are completely over".
The foreign ministry phoned US ambassador John Bass on Wednesday morning.
While Ankara and Washington are allies, the US depends on Kurdish forces for support in attacking IS in northern Syria.
However, Turkey has insisted Kurdish militia, which it regards as terrorists, retreat east across the Euphrates river.
Turkey has been fighting a Kurdish insurgency in its south-east for decades and fears Kurdish gains in northern Syria will fuel Kurdish separatism at home.
Turkish forces and allied factions of the rebel Free Syrian Army (FSA) forced IS out of the Syrian border city of Jarablus a week ago and have since pounded neighbouring villages held by Kurdish-led, US-backed Syria Democratic Forces (SDF).
The Kurdish Popular Protection Units (YPG), which dominates the SDF, says its forces have withdrawn, and that the Turkish action against the group was a "pretext" for occupying Syria.
At the weekend, the US Defence Secretary Ash Carter called on Turkey to stay focused on the fight against IS and not to engage the SDF.
He said the US was "very supportive" of Turkey's general counter-IS activities and its efforts to secure the border - but not the area south of Jarablus.
Separately, a spokesman for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan criticised EU states for their response to a failed coup in the country last month.
Ibrahim Kalin said it was unacceptable that EU countries had not sent high-level representatives to Turkey after the coup attempt, which the presidency says was planned by supporters of Fethullah Gulen, a powerful US-based Muslim cleric.
EU officials had spoken of their concern at a crackdown led by Mr Erdogan on state institutions in the wake of the coup attempt.

Mae rhannau o'r e-byst newydd eu cyhoeddi ym mhapur newydd The Church Timesac mae copïau ohonynt yn nwylo'r BBC.
Mae e-bost dyddiedig 8 Chwefror, a lofnodir gyda'r enw John ac a gredir gan The Church Times o gael ei anfon gan Y Gwir Barchedig John Davies, Esgob Abertawe ac Aberhonddu at ei gyd-esgobion yn dweud: "Mae fy ngreddf yn dweud wrthai na fyddai safiad JJ ar fater perthynas un rhyw a'i sefyllfa ef ei hun yn cael llawer o groeso yn yr Esgobaeth...

The university said the new machine would allow academics to work on more projects at faster speeds.
Iridis4 will be used for subjects such as engineering, archaeology and medicine, as well as computer science.
Pro vice-chancellor Prof Philip Nelson said: "Staying ahead of the game in high performance computing [HPC] is vital to help the university stay competitive.
"Simulation and computation enabled by HPC are recognised globally as the third pillar of modern research and this investment will ensure we remain world leaders in this field."
Iridis4 will be used for a range of research, including engineering, archaeology and medicine, as well as computer science.
The world's most powerful computer is China's Tianhe-2, which can perform 33,860 trillion calculations per second.

Article: The company is in talks with several Japanese lenders over money it needs to reorganise its business in the wake of a massive accounting scandal.
The embattled electronics giant is hoping for loans of up to 250bn yen ($2.2bn; Â£1.6bn), said Nikkei daily.
Toshiba confirmed it was in talks but said the details had not been decided.
The Nikkei daily said Sumitomo Mitsui Banking, Mizuho Bank and Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank were like to provide the funds as early as this month.
The funds are vital for the survival of the Japanese conglomerate as it streamlines its bloated businesses, whose poor performances had gone unnoticed during almost a decade of false accounting.
The restructuring comes after the company admitted in 2015 it had overstated its profits by $1.3bn over seven years.
As part of the efforts to balance its books, the firm has announced major job cuts and the selling of several plants and units to external investors.
Toshiba currently employs almost 200,000 people.
Its shares have lost about 40% of their value since April last year, when news of the profit overstatement began to emerge.
In July, its chief executive, president and six other high-level executives resigned from the company.
Toshiba, which is involved in a wide-range of industries from electronics to nuclear energy, was founded in 1875 and launched the world's first mass-market laptop in 1985.

Article: Pavey, a mother of two who only gave birth to her younger child Emily 11 months ago, ran the perfect tactical race to match the gold won by her old friend Paula Radcliffe in Munich 12 years ago.
When France's Clemence Calvin - 16 years her junior and almost 20 seconds faster this season - went to the front with two laps to go Pavey tucked in behind.
Then, at the bell, the Briton surged into the lead, held Calvin at bay on the back straight and kicked hard again as she came off the top bend to race to her first ever major title.
She becomes the oldest female gold medallist in the championships' history, and having won Commonwealth 5,000m bronze 10 days ago seals a wonderful summer at an age when most athletes are long retired.
Pavey told BBC Sport: "I just can't believe it. I was finding it quite a long way - I was thinking, is this the right event?
"I'm really thrilled. I tried to do a controlled last lap, but when I got to the home straight I thought, just give it all you've got, so you don't regret anything."
The time - 32 minutes 22.39 seconds - was irrelevant, Calvin hanging on for silver and her compatriot Laila Traby taking bronze.
British team captain Goldie Sayers had given a speech on the eve of the championships asking her team-mates a simple question: "How would you perform if this was the last time you would ever compete?"
Her room-mate Pavey gave the best possible answer.
The Exeter Harrier has been running for her country for so long that she made her debut in a British vest in the same year her team-mate Morgan Lake was born.
Across four Olympic Games she has secured three top ten places, but this was a glorious finale that few could have predicted.
And on her lap of honour she ran to Emily and four-year-old son Jacob before embracing husband and coach Gavin and her own parents.
Earlier, all three of the British men made it safely through to Wednesday's semi-finals of the 100m, Dwain Chambers winning the second heat in 10.18 secs and James Dasaolu the third, easing up in 10.22 secs, before Harry Aikines-Aryeetey took his in 10.19 secs.
But France's Jimmy Vicaut, the only man in the field to run under 10 seconds this summer, looks the man to beat after an impressive 10.06 secs - the joint third fastest time in the championships' long history.
World champion Christine Ohuruogu also appears to be coming into some form at the right time, winning her 400m heat in 51.40 secs, while Tiffany Porter is into the 100m hurdles final as the fastest qualifier.
But there was disappointment for Britain's two 800m men, Andrew Osagie and Michael Rimmer, who failed to get through to the semi-finals, 28 years after the famous night when Sebastian Coe, Tom McKean and Steve Cram won European gold, silver and bronze for a British clean sweep.

Article: Set 284 for victory, England reached 46-2 at the close of day four in Sharjah - their record fourth-innings run chase in Asia is 209 in 2010.
Bowler Anderson said: "We'd happily lose 2-0 trying to chase the total.
"We know it is going to turn and they have got some world-class spinners, so we are going to have to bat very well."
He added: "We have got some world-class batsman in our line-up. They are going to have to pull their fingers out and bat really well."
Mohammad Hafeez hit 151 as Pakistan - 146-3 overnight - were bowled out for 355 in their second innings.
Jonny Bairstow missed a stumping off Adil Rashid in the first over of day four with Hafeez on 97, and the opener was dropped by Stuart Broad on 113.
England lost Moeen Ali for 22 and Ian Bell for a duck in the space of 13 balls before the close.
Alastair Cook, who hit an unbeaten century when England successfully chased 209 to beat Bangladesh by nine wickets at Dhaka in 2010, will resume on 17 and Joe Root six on Thursday.
"Hopefully, we can get a couple of big partnerships and a couple of big individual scores," added Anderson, who took 2-52.
"We are going to have to bat the whole day to win or draw."
"England are not totally out of it but their chances have gone from one in six to one in 15 or 20," former England batsman Geoffrey Boycott told BBC Test Match Special.
"Joe Root and Alastair Cook are quality players but they didn't look at ease. If they go it is all over."
Former England captain Michael Vaughan added: "It's been a tough day for England. Hafeez's innings could be the difference.
"Pakistan are favourites but you just never know if England can get one player to 100. There's a 15% chance of an England win."

Article: The lawsuit filed in a federal court in San Francisco argues that the policy is unconstitutional.
Women can serve in front line positions in the US military, but they are barred from ground combat units.
A Pentagon spokesman said 14,500 combat positions had been opened to women under the current defence secretary.
He added that Defence Secretary Leon Panetta had "directed the services to explore the possibility of opening additional roles for women in the military".
But ACLU lawyer Ariela Migdal said the changes so far were "not enough". The lawsuit argues that continuing restrictions violate servicewomen's constitutional rights to equality.
One of the plaintiffs, Marine Corps Capt Zoe Bedell, said existing rules had blocked her advancement in the Marines.
"The military is the last place where you are allowed to be discriminated against because of your gender," she said.
Women account for about 14% of the 1.4 million active US military personnel.
The lawsuit launched on Tuesday says they are barred from 238,000 positions, but also alleges that they are already serving unofficially in combat units.

Article: Gatland says Henry indicated to his players at the outset of the trip of Australia who would be selected for the Test matches.
He says that meant his compatriot "lost half the team on day one".
"The players knew straight away what was the Test side and who was making up the numbers," said the New Zealander.
Gatland, who on Wednesday named his side to face the Provincial Barbarians in the tour opener on Saturday, says each of his 41-man squad is in contention to face the All Blacks.
"Keeping harmony in the squad is paramount," he said. "It's about giving everyone an opportunity.
"It's important these guys feel like they are putting themselves in the shop window and have a chance to prove themselves, and with a little bit of luck are in contention for the Tests.

Owen Farrell and Johnny Sexton appear to be in competition for the fly-half spot after Gatland reiterated he sees the Englishman as a "world-class 10", rather than a centre.
Irishman Sexton starts on Saturday, with Farrell on the bench.
"The players are pretty aware about the competition in that position," Gatland said. "Johnny gets a start on Saturday, and the other two [Farrell and Dan Biggar] will get a start in the next two games."
Gatland's son Bryn will start for the Provincial Barbarians at fly-half.
"I spoke to Bryn last night and he's enjoying the week," Gatland Sr said. "We'll catch up tomorrow, and he'll expect to have to make a few tackles on the weekend.

Article: She made the announcement at the Dorset Rape Crisis charity screening of the show's final episode in Bridport, Dorset, on Monday evening.
Hesmondhalgh said she was proud to have "given a voice" to rape victims in the eight-part crime serial.
The charity said it was "excited" she had agreed to take the position.
The storyline of the third and final series of Broadchurch, which is part-filmed in West Bay, centred on the rape of Trish Winterman - played by former Coronation Street actress Hesmondhalgh.
Among the relationships that develop in the show is Trish's work with her rape counsellor Beth Lattimer, portrayed by Jodie Whittaker.
Tracy Parsons, from Dorset Rape Crisis, which worked closely with Broadchurch's writer and producer, Chris Chibnall, said the programmes had shown there was support for people struggling with the legacy of rape.
"We are really excited that Julie has agreed to be our patron - it's huge for our trustees, staff and clients that someone who is so well known is coming onboard," she said.
Hesmondhalgh said: "I was very relieved that I had given a voice - in my own small way in this big project - to the people who have been through [rape]."
Of her new role as patron of Dorset Rape Crisis, she said: "I feel very proud to be part of increasing the profile of anybody who is doing this incredible, important, essential work."
She described rape as a "pressing" issue, adding: "We need to start having conversations at home with our families - with our daughters and our sons - about consent and about respect, and about healthy, sexual relationships."

Article: Yn ôl y corff sydd yn cynrychioli busnesau gofal, mae nifer yn ymladd i gadw fynd ac yn wynebu argyfwng recriwtio wrth i ysbytai ac archfarchnadoedd gystadlu am weithwyr.
Mae Cymdeithas Llywodraeth Leol Cymru yn dweud bod yn rhaid i awdurdodau lleol gael fwy o arian i dalu cyflogau gwell i'r gweithwyr.
Dadl Llywodraeth Cymru yw eu bod wedi buddsoddi yn y sector, gan gynnwys rhoi mwy o gyllid fel bod cynghorau yn gallu cwrdd â'r cynnydd yn y cyflog byw cenedlaethol sydd yn dod i rym mis Ebrill.
Gofynnodd rhaglen BBC Week In Week Out wrth awdurdodau lleol faint o gwmnïau oedd wedi tynnu yn ôl o ddarparu pecyn gofal ar ôl cael cytundeb.
Dywedodd 13 o'r 21 cyngor wnaeth ymateb eu bod wedi wynebu'r sefyllfa yma.
Mae Colin Angel o Gymdeithas Gofal Cartref Prydain, sef y corff sydd yn cynrychioli cwmnïau gofal, yn dweud bod nifer o'u haelodau yn ei chael hi'n anodd i oroesi.
"Yr hyn rydyn ni'n clywed yng Nghymru yw bod rhai darparwyr mewn cyfyng gyngor, ac yn ceisio yn galed i ganfod ffordd i barhau fel busnes gyda'r cyfraddau maen nhw'n cael eu talu gan y cynghorau lleol."
Mae'n dweud bod peryg y bydd cwmnïau yn dod i ben, a hynny yn gyflymach mewn ardaloedd gwledig.
Un cwmni wnaeth orfod rhoi'r gorau i ddarparu gofal i gyngor Conwy oedd Cymorth Llaw.
Roedd y cyngor wedi cynnig talu £15 yr awr i'r cwmni, ond penderfynodd y busnes nad oedd hynny'n ddigon o arian.
Dywedodd pennaeth Cymorth Llaw, Ken Hogg: "Doedden ni ddim yn meddwl y bydden ni yn gallu darparu'r lefel yma o wasanaeth am y pris roedd Conwy yn gynnig. Ac mi oedden ni yn gyndyn iawn, iawn o adael ond mi oedd yn rhaid i ni adael.
"Ar ddiwedd y dydd, busnes ydyn ni. Mae'n rhaid i'n rheolwr banc fod yn hapus. Mae'n rhaid i ni wneud rhyw fath o elw ar ddiwedd y flwyddyn."
Mae Cyngor Conwy yn dweud eu bod wedi ymrwymo i gefnogi pobl fregus mewn cymunedau, er yr heriau ariannol.
Yn ôl Steve Thomas o Gymdeithas Llywodraeth Leol Cymru, mae cynghorau angen mwy o arian er mwyn gallu talu cyflogau gwell i ofalwyr.
"Fel mae hi, oni bai ein bod ni'n cael mwy o arian yn dod mewn i'r system mae gyda ni broblem fawr," meddai.
"Does 'na neb yn ymfalchïo yn y cyflog rydyn ni yn talu'r rhai sy'n gweithio yn y sector gofal cymdeithasol."
Ym mis Mawrth cyhoeddodd Llywodraeth y DU £2bn yn ychwanegol ar gyfer gofal cymdeithasol yn Lloegr, a £200m i Gymru.
Ond dyw Llywodraeth Cymru ddim wedi penderfynu eto beth fyddan nhw'n gwneud efo'r arian.
Mae'r gweinidog sydd â chyfrifoldeb am y maes, Rebecca Evans AC, yn dweud mai penderfyniad i gabinet Llywodraeth Cymru yw sut i wario'r arian ond eu bod nhw'n gweithredu i ddatrys problemau recriwtio ac y bydd cyflwyno cynllun gofrestru ar gyfer gweithwyr yn 2020 yn helpu.
"Bydd hynny yn rhoi'r clod dyledus i'r gweithlu, achos pan mae'n dod at edrych ar ôl ein pobl fwyaf bregus, pa swydd sydd yn fwy pwysig na hynny?
"Fe fydd hefyd yn rhoi cyfle i bobl yn y maes gael y cyfle i feddwl am ddatblygu eu gyrfa, achos dyw hynny ddim yn digwydd ar hyn o bryd."

Article: Tenants cleared from Glancalvie Estate set up a camp in Croick Churchyard, near Ardgay, 170 years ago.
Some who camped scratched their names into the glass of the church windows. The names are still visible today.
A descendant of one of the infants fed from the decanter has handed it into the care of Inverness Museum.
Donald MacMillan's grandmother Christina Ross was the daughter of John Ross, a shepherd who with his family and others was cleared from the estate.
They set up a temporary camp at Croick Church in Sutherland in May 1845. The families later left to settle in other parts of the Highlands.
With help from High Life Highland, which runs Inverness Museum, Mr MacMillan researched his family's history and was able to add new details to what he already knew about his grandmother.
She and various members of her family went on to settle in and around Kilmorack, near Beauly, and Achnagart in Glen Shiel.
Those who worked with Mr MacMillan in the research were Anne Fraser, family historian at the Highland Archive Centre, and Cait McCullagh, curator at the museum.
Jim Hunter, emeritus professor of history at the University of the Highlands and Islands and an author of books on the clearances, also assisted in researching the significance of the Croick Decanter.
To mark the relic's donation an event will be held at Inverness Museum and Art Gallery on 27 August.
Prof Hunter will deliver a talk called Indelible Characters: Relics and remnants of Highland Clearance times.
Starting in the late 18th Century and running into the 19th Century, the Highland Clearances saw townships occupied by generations of families cleared to make way for large-scale sheep farming and the rearing of deer.
Landowners were seeking to "improve" their estates in line with the industrial revolution. Their hope was to make more capital from the land by running shooting estates, or starting industrial-scale livestock farming.
In some cases people who had lived on the land for generations left voluntarily, while others were forcibly evicted and their homes burned and demolished.
The clearances have influenced the stories of two new films.
Slow West, a Western starring Michael Fassbender and Kodi Smit-McPhee and written and directed by Scotsman John Maclean, opened in UK cinemas in June.
Its plot features a clearance based on forced evictions in Wester Ross.
The second film, a new short, will tell the story of Kate McPherson, who was among 80 people cleared off land in Sutherland and emigrated to Canada where they were settled in the Red River colony.
Once in Canada, they had to walk 100 mile (161km) to the colony in wintry conditions in handmade snowshoes.
Sutherland-born composer Robert Aitken is in the process of making the short film, Last Footsteps of Home.
It will be free of dialogue.

Article: Margaret Henderson-McCarroll pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Eddie Girvan, 67, on the grounds of diminished responsibility in May.
The 31 year old, who has 100 previous convictions, was told she must serve three years in prison.
Sentencing her, Mr Justice Treacy said it was "an horrific crime".
Speaking in court on Monday, he said the victim "must have suffered terribly".
Mr Girvan was found dead at his Greenisland home in County Antrim. He was virtually naked, bound and gagged on 18 January 2016.
He had been stabbed in the chest and suffocated after being gagged with kitchen roll and a tie to stop him calling out for help.
The court had heard previously that either injury could have killed him.
The court was told that the pair, who had known each other for some years, had argued over money for sex.
Henderson-McCarroll said she had been acting in self defence and "poked" her victim with a cake knife after Mr Girvan came at her with a stick sword.
She said she had not meant to kill him and admitted that she had been high on crystal meth and heroin at the time.
After the stabbing, Henderson-McCarroll admitted taking more heroin "to calm her nerves" before stealing Mr Girvan's car and driving it to Belfast.
She was involved in an accident at Custom House Square, Belfast which led police to find Mr Girvan's car at the city hostel where she had been living.
She was later arrested on an unrelated bench warrant and found to have a sat nav, a watch, and two sets of car keys in her possession.
The sat nav contained Mr Girvan's home address and, after several attempts to contact him at home, police broke in and found his body.
Henderson-McCarroll has 100 previous convictions for robbery, theft and assault.
The court heard she had bitten, punched and head butted elderly men, young women and children in the course of past crimes.
A doctor's report stated that she had lived a "chaotic life" of drug addiction, alcohol abuse, crime and prostitution.
The court was told that she relapsed into heroin and crystal meth addiction after the death of her baby daughter.
She also previously admitted eight other charges connected to Mr Girvan's killing:
* Theft;
* Attempted theft;
* Aggravated vehicle-taking causing damage;
* Dangerous driving;
* Driving when unfit through drink or drugs;
* Driving without insurance;
* Failing to stop at an accident
* Failing to report an accident
For those crimes, she was sentenced to between one month and a year in prison - all to be served concurrently with her manslaughter sentence which was six years - three to be served in prison and three on licence.

Article: He was seriously injured in a bomb attack in Afghanistan in 2006.
Since carrying the torch on 26 June, Doncaster-based L/Bdr Parkinson has had thousands of requests on Facebook.
But the site limits friend associations to 5,000 per personal page and he cannot accept all the requests.
Flanked by hundreds of people, he walked for nearly half an hour with the Olympic torch with an assistant who supported his arm.
L/Bdr Parkinson's nomination stated: "The brain injury took his speech, but not his personality and sense of humour," adding he now speaks unaided.
It said: "Determined to prove everyone wrong, he fought back every step of the way. Ben's intelligence and wit [are] unchanged. Still the same funny and caring Ben."
He spends 12 hours a day in the gym and rehab and walks with crutches, spending "the rest of his time spent raising money for many military charities and as patron of his beloved  
          Pilgrim Bandits
".
L/Bdr Parkinson's mother Diane said the responses had "been phenomenal" and that Ben was really "buoyed up" by the support and friendship he had been shown.
She said: "It's just unbelievable, Ben's had way over 5,000 friend requests but Facebook won't let him have more than that number.
"Thousands of people have joined the Pilgrim Bandits website and the messages of support we've had are great.
"Ben's page has had 19,000 hits just on an update, I don't understand how these things work, but it's phenomenal."
She said the amount of post the family had received had also increased.
She added: "Some mail has just been addressed to Ben, please Mr Postie.
"E-mail traffic has gone through the roof and Ben's had hundreds of requests to visit places with the [Olympic] torch.
"He's absolutely bouncing and buoyed up and elated."
Facebook would not comment on the issue but their guidance was that if people were receiving this many requests then they have become a public figure, so should consider having a page instead of a profile.
Alternatively, Ben could use subscribe so that people can see his public updates without actually becoming a friend.

Article: Those selling the illicit weapons often disassembled and sent them in different packages or embedded them in old stereos or printers, the report found.
Researchers found that firearms and related goods generated 136 sales per month and a monthly revenue of $80,000 (Â£62,000).
The firearms trade has gained attention following recent terrorist attacks.
The dark net is a part of the internet that requires specific software to access, in order for users to remain anonymous.
While the trade was unlikely to fuel large-scale terrorist operations, it had the potential to become the platform of choice for "lone-wolf" terrorists to obtain weapons and ammunition, the report said.
Non-profit organisation Rand Corporation Europe, working with Manchester University, found 52 unique vendors selling weapons or similar items such as ammunition, explosives, or components such as silencers across 811 listings and 18 markets.
Police believe the 2016 Munich shooting, which left nine people dead, used weapons purchased on the dark net.
Lead author of the research, Giacomo Persi Paoli, said: "Recent high-profile cases have shown that the threat posed by individuals or small groups obtaining weapons illegally from the dark web is real.
"The ability to not only arm criminals and terrorists, who can make virtually anonymous purchases, but also vulnerable and fixated individuals is perhaps the most dangerous aspect."
Guns account for less than 1% of items sold on the platform, with its main trade being in narcotics.
Nevertheless, the volume being sold "can be considered sufficiently high to be a cause of concern for policy makers and law enforcement agencies", said the report.
The study involved collecting data from 12 dark net marketplaces during a week in September 2016.
Most of those selling guns were based in the US, but Europe was the most popular destination for the weapons they sold.
Judith Aldridge, co-investigator on the study, said: "In very simple terms, anyone can connect to the dark web and within minutes have access to a variety of vendors offering their products, which are most often illegal.
"The dark web enables illegal trade at a global level, removing some of the geographical barriers between vendors and buyers, while increasing the personal safety of both buyers and sellers through a series of anonymising features that obscure their identities."

Article: It passed a resolution following an "overwhelming" vote in favour of staying in the EU, which it said was based on the "balance of existing evidence".
The union - which has 55,000 members in England and Wales - announced its position after a vote by its council.
However, the NFU said it would not be actively campaigning in the referendum.
It said its council members looked at a number of issues, including the impact leaving the EU would have on agricultural trade and the availability of labour.
It has also completed 28 roadshows to debate key farming issues in the referendum with members, and sent two reports to its members.
The organisation said it was not joining any campaign groups and would not be telling its members how to vote.
The union has not released how each of its 90 council members voted.
However, its president, Meurig Raymond, said there had been an "overwhelming" vote in favour of staying in the EU.
"We believe it's for the betterment of the future of British agriculture," he said.
"On all the surveys we have done in the NFU, the majority believe that we should stay in."
He added: "We have had 28 meetings across the country in the last three weeks.
"We have spoken to three or four thousand people. So the delegates here today brought the views from those meetings to our council meeting."

While the NFU doesn't represent all farmers, this decision will be influential.
As an established well-funded organisation, the NFU has access to information and expert advice that the average farmer doesn't have time to seek out.
The debate in the council chamber was impassioned, with members talking about what the decision could mean for the future of their children.
The judgement will also play an important part in the wider European debate. Over the last few weeks key figures from both sides of the referendum campaign have been on the phone to the NFU asking for updates, keen to know what side they will come down on.
Now, everyone knows what the council thinks - it's now down to the farmers to decide.
The NFU says more than 70% of full-time farmers in England and Wales are members.
The resolution comes after the NFU in Scotland and the Tenant Farmers' Association both expressed support for remaining in the EU.
However, farming minister George Eustice, who wants to leave the EU, said "virtually every problem that the NFU complain to me about is a direct consequence of dysfunctional EU law".
He said farmers who "want to see change and a better future" should vote to leave.
Last month, Prime Minister David Cameron, who is campaigning to remain in the EU, warned British agriculture would suffer if the UK votes to leave the union.
He said farmers could lose as much as Â£330m on lamb and beef exports if Britain were to leave.
However, former environment secretary Owen Paterson has said Britain's farmers would be better off outside the EU.

Article: Paul Mason, of Ipswich, used to weigh 70 stone (440kg) but has lost more than 40 stone (254kg) with the help of gastric band surgery.
He hopes the procedures in New York will help shed seven stone (44kg). His visa application had been delayed due to a previous criminal conviction.
Mr Mason still needs to raise about Â£7,000 towards surgery-related costs.
He was in the US in December for a consultation with Dr Jennifer Capla, who offered to remove his excess skin for free after hearing that the NHS would not perform the operations as quickly as Mr Mason hoped.
However, his plans to make a quick return to the country were delayed when his visa application was referred to Homeland Security in March, because of a conviction for fraud in 1986.
He has now received his visa and had been due to have surgery on 20 October.
But this has been postponed as he needs to raise $12,000 (Â£7,400) to cover the post-surgery costs, which include accommodation and medicine. He is due to fly out later this week.
Last time he was in the US he appeared on The View TV programme, where he accepted a marriage proposal from his girlfriend, Rebecca Mountain, who lives in Massachusetts.

Article: In a study on mice, Hsp90 inhibitors were found to strip cancer cells of defences against hormone treatments.
This makes the drugs particularly promising for treating drug-resistant cancers, the research team said.
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the UK.
About one in eight men will get prostate cancer at some point in their lives. It mainly affects men over the age of 50.
The cancer can sometimes be treated successfully with hormone treatments, which target androgen receptors linked to the growth of male hormones called androgens.
But some prostate cancers don't work that way. Instead they create an abnormal form of androgen receptor which is not linked to the growth of hormones and therefore does not respond to standard hormone treatment.
This is the most common form of resistance in prostate cancer which leads to aggressive, difficult-to-treat cancers.
The latest research, published in the journal Cancer Research, found that a new class of drugs reduced production of both receptors.
Professor Paul Workman, study author and chief executive of the Institute of Cancer Research, said it was an exciting discovery.
"We call Hsp90 inhibitors 'network drugs' because they tackle several of the signals that are hijacked in cancer all at once, across a network rather than just a single signalling pathway.
"These drugs can hit cancer harder than those targeting only one protein, and look promising for preventing or overcoming drug resistance."
Prof Workman said the next step was to test the Hsp90 inhibitors in clinical trials on patients with aggressive, drug-resistant prostate cancer.
Prof Johann de Bono, a professor of experimental cancer medicine at the Institute of Cancer Research, said: "These drugs are already in clinical trials for several types of cancer, and I am excited that our work suggests they could also benefit men with prostate cancer who have otherwise run out of treatment options."

Article: Internet service providers had until Tuesday to implement the ban.
The sites now redirect to a message explaining they have been blocked "by decision of public authorities".
In 2015, the authorities banned 11 popular pornography websites, saying many failed to protect children "from information harmful to their health".
Analysis by Vitaliy Shevchenko, BBC Monitoring
The decision was made following two separate court rulings, which said the websites "spread pornography".
Sexually explicit content is not outlawed in Russia, but the law bans "the illegal production, dissemination and advertisement of pornographic materials and objects".
It is not uncommon for Russia to ban websites. The government agency Roskomnadzor maintains a blacklist that now includes thousands of them.
Access is usually blocked for violating the notoriously vague extremism legislation or child protection laws.
Websites critical of the Kremlin have been blocked too, and at one point Wikipedia was blacklisted.
Following the 2015 ban, one woman asked Roskomnadzor on Twitter whether it could recommend an alternative.
The agency replied: "You can meet someone in real life."
On Tuesday, it said its earlier tweet was "still relevant".
However, open rights campaigners have warned that local bans can be defeated.
"Blocking porn is the fastest way to ensure widespread adoption of censorship circumvention in your country," said Eva Galperin, global policy analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
One of the affected porn sites offered Roskomnadzor a premium subscription to its service, in exchange for lifting the ban.
The government agency said it was "not in the market" for such an offer.
Nadya Tolokonnikova, lead singer from punk band Pussy Riot, joked that the ban was "a blow below the belt".

Article: School staff should also watch for signs of FGM, such as frequent toilet trips and girls in pain.
The Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL) says teachers need more training to help them identity and protect girls at risk.
At least 66,000 girls and women in the UK are believed to be victims of FGM.
Campaigners say girls are most at risk of undergoing the procedure during the long summer holidays.
The ATL, at its annual conference in Manchester, passed a resolution to lobby politicians to eliminate the practice and to develop resources to advise teachers and support staff on how to tackle the problem.
Proposing the motion, Helen Porter, from Berkshire, said school staff should openly discuss the issue with parents.
"Schools and education staff can help by opening discussion with parents, and scrutinising holiday requests and summer holiday plans from members of communities that practise FGM.
"They should be vigilant for the signs of FGM such as frequent toilet visits and pain whilst sitting down. Schools should publicise the NSPCC's FGM helpline to pupils, parents and staff.
"We must aim to empower girls by discussion in age-appropriate PSHE [personal, social and health education] lessons delivered by trained teachers.
"We must equally empower boys to challenge this practice. Do they want this for their sisters, daughters, girlfriends or wives?"
Ms Porter said the practice of FGM should never be described as female circumcision, as there was no medical benefit and rarely any anaesthetic used.
She said the term female circumcision was "equivalent to describing deforestation as rainforest topiary".
Ms Porter said: "FGM is child abuse. It is a violation of a child's human rights, and according to the United Nations is a cruel, inhumane and degrading torture that should be eliminated."
Tendai Mashapure, from Cambridgeshire, said: "We need to commit ourselves to the creation of an enabling environment where individuals are empowered to make decisions based on the best interest of their children.
"FGM will not end only by targeting those who practise FGM, but rather by engaging with all families, focusing on youth who will be future parents and targeting the leaders who have influence over community members.
"In other words, by reducing the demand for the practice, it will eventually become obsolete."
ATL general secretary Dr Mary Bousted said: "Teachers have been put in a position of great responsibility. What they need now is clear guidance on how to fulfil those responsibilities.
"They need a clear system for reporting their concerns."
Dr Bousted welcomed the letter that Education Secretary Michael Gove sent to schools last term, urging them to protect girls at risk from what he described as "this very serious form of child abuse".
FGM includes procedures that remove or injure female genital organs for non-medical reasons.
Dangers include severe bleeding, problems urinating, infections, infertility, mental health problems, complications in childbirth and increased risk of death for newborns.
Two men were charged last month, in connection with performing FGM, under the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003. They were the first people in Britain to face such charges.
The NSPCC children's charity set up a 24-hour FGM helpline last year.

Article: Something Wicked this Way Comes, shown on a Sunday morning, featured the illusionist putting a plastic bag over his head and walking on broken glass.
Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom said children could have imitated Brown's "clearly dangerous behaviour".
It received five complaints about the show, which aired on UKTV's Watch channel on 6 December.
UKTV said the programme was broadcast in error and was unsuitable for a pre-watershed transmission.
In the 14-minute segment, Brown had sought to demonstrate a technique to limit pain and bleeding.   He placed a transparent bag over his head and sealed it while a member of the audience tapped out his pulse rate on a drum.
Once his pulse rate had slowed to a stop, Brown - who appeared to be in a state of semi-consciousness - removed the bag from his head and walked barefoot on a path of broken glass.
At the end of the sequence, the camera zoomed on his feet to show that they had not bled as a result of contact with the glass.
Ofcom said: "Plastic bags are a common household item that children frequently have access to without parental supervision. They also present a widely acknowledged risk of harm to young children.
"Therefore, Ofcom took the view that Derren Brown's use of a plastic bag to asphyxiate himself was likely to be easily imitable by children in a manner that was harmful.
"This was particularly because self-asphyxiation was presented as a way to carry out acts which would not normally be possible because of the bleeding and pain that resulted.
"Further in this programme no negative consequences of self-asphyxiation were identified."
Ofcom also found that Brown's use of swear words during the segment breached the code on offensive language before the watershed.
UKTV said an internal investigation had revealed that "due to human error" the programme was "erroneously labelled" as being suitable for broadcast before the watershed.
It said it had implemented additional safeguards to prevent the same mistake happening again.

Article: Curtis and assistant manager Paul Williams will take charge of Saturday's match against Bournemouth after Bob Bradley's sacking.
Swansea want to appoint their new boss as soon as possible, with ex-Derby manager Paul Clement the first choice.
"We've got to go with somebody who will to get us out of trouble," he said.
"If we were to go down - and there's obviously that possibility - you look at the Championship and it seems to have got a lot stronger. It's not a foregone conclusion [to go straight back up].
"I know Norwich and Burnley have done it but it's difficult. Newcastle look like they'll do it but they're a big, powerful club who can hang on to a lot of their top players. I'm not sure we'd be able to do that.
"If we go down, it's going to be tough to get back."
Swansea were promoted to the Premier League in 2011 and quickly established a reputation as a well-run club with a team that played exciting, possession-based football.
Their promotion capped a remarkable rise from the brink of bankruptcy a decade earlier and almost being relegated out of the Football League altogether in 2003.
Curtis - a former player who was at the club throughout their rise up the divisions - believes the Swans have not been the same since Michael Laudrup left in 2014.
"I think we have [lost our way]. It's just the change of management all the time," Curtis added.
"The best eras were Roberto Martinez, Brendan Rodgers and Michael Laudrup. But we've probably lost a bit of the 'Swansea Way'. It has been diluted.
"We've lost quite a few players too but have we adequately replaced them?"

Curtis believes the current Swansea squad is good enough to stay up, and the 62-year-old reminds every new signing of how far the club has come.

She thought she saw a dead baby in the bus stop near the Magpie and Stump pub and screamed at her father to drive back to check, which he did.
Mr Braxton, 35, said he saw the lifeless naked baby on the ground, with her umbilical cord still attached.
"We blocked the road off and rang the emergency services," he told BBC Radio Wales.
"I had a dressing gown in the car and ran to grab that, wrapped the baby up, gave her some good hard rubs on the chest and the head.
"She took one big gulp of breath and opened her beautiful little eyes."
Mr Braxton, who is originally from Birmingham and living in nearby Pensarn, said they guessed that the baby was less than one hour old.
"To be honest, I think the fatherly instinct and the adrenaline kicked in because my daughter was hysterical and my partner was hysterical," he added.
"So it was just a case of as soon as I saw her lying there, her naked little body just left on cold concrete, I knew something had to be done."
Mr Braxton said police have told him that the baby has "stabilised and is on her way to a full recovery".
Police are concerned about the welfare of the baby's mother and have urged her to come forward.
Helen Douglas, of North Wales Police, said: "We are concerned about the health of the mother of the baby girl and are appealing for her to come forward.

Article: Data shows that the total tuition fee and maintenance loan balance is up 12% on the previous year's figures.
Graduates start repaying their debt once their income reaches £21,000 but after 30 years outstanding debt is written off.
For those repaying loans in 2017 the average sum owed at the start of repayment was £19,280.
That compares with £32,220 for English students, £20,990 for Northern Irish students and £11,740 for Scottish students who do not pay fees if they study in Scotland.
The figures come from the Student Loans Company and cover 2016/17.
Welsh domiciled students have been able to claim a grant towards their tuition fees since 2012-13 - a sum of £4,954 in 2017-18.
But the grants are due to be scrapped from 2018-19 with help for maintenance costs introduced instead, under plans unveiled last year.
At the end of 2016-17 there were 304,900 borrowers of higher education student loans in Wales, with 191,100 liable for repayment.
As of the end of April 2017 there are 41,430 borrowers who had fully repaid, amounting to 16.4% of the overall total.

Article: He said such a series "would show what a great service the programme is performing for young entrepreneurs, young people, to inspire them".
The BBC said there are no current plans to broadcast a spin-off series.
Speaking about some of the show's past winners, Lord Sugar said: "They've turned into great business people."
He added: "I think the BBC need to do something about that. They need to do a programme, for example, on where they are now."
Earlier this year, BBC Two broadcast a spin-off programme from Dragons' Den, Pitches to Riches, which charted the trajectory of several business ideas the so-called Dragons had invested in.
Lord Sugar added that the success of previous Apprentice winners was "what motivates me to carry on doing [the show]".
"They're doing very well, and they don't get enough publicity. The BBC doesn't get enough publicity over the purpose of this programme.
"I enjoy watching these young people grow a business from scratch really, and that's why I get a great buzz out of it."
"Ricky Martin [2012 series winner] has got about 25 people working for him, Tom [Pellereau, 2011 winner] has eight or nine working for him, Leah [Totton, 2013 winner] has got two clinics now."
He added: "They are one of the reasons why the candidates flock to the auditions because they want to be them."
Not every previous contestant on the show has gone on to success in the business world, however.
One of the most high-profile former candidates is Katie Hopkins - who is now a newspaper columnist and radio presenter, well-known for her controversial opinions
"You get a few people that are picked up by the media because of their outlandish comments, and they go and pursue a separate career," Lord Sugar said.
"Lots of them have tried. Katie Hopkins has found herself a special niche in the market. She's a bit like Piers Morgan on steroids, and of course the media lap it up. And the more controversial she wants to be, the more they lap it up."
Claude Littner and Karren Brady have returned to assist Lord Sugar on the new series of The Apprentice, which begins on 6 October on BBC One.
The businessman said the show's tasks had been updated for 2016.
"One of the things I love about this process is, as I'm getting older, I've got a great production team that keep me on my toes as far as technology is concerned.
"With a lot of the tasks some of the stuff we're going to be doing didn't exist 12 years ago. For example, there's a virtual reality episode in there."
Lord Sugar said he believes "the freshness of the contestants" keeps the show relevant, adding: "One of them was 11 years old when The Apprentice first started and has watched it since then and here they are, turning up to be one of the contestants in the show."
"We have a new audience growing every year, and that's the excitement of the programme."
Lord Sugar was speaking hours after Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump took part in a televised debate with the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
From 2004 until last year, Trump appeared as the figurehead of the US version of The Apprentice - the position Lord Sugar holds on the UK show.
Asked for his thoughts on his former US counterpart, Lord Sugar said: "Well he's not as good as me, as far as The Apprentice is concerned. He's not in my class, quite frankly.
"I saw the debate with him and Hillary Clinton and what comes to mind is that it's like a US version of Would I Lie To You?
"As many people have said it is quite a frightening thought that he may be the most powerful man in the world shortly."
Karren Brady added: "For me personally, I think Hillary Clinton, another woman leader across the world, means the world is a safer and better place."
Lord Sugar also did not shy away from talking about UK politics, commenting that the outcome of the EU Referendum in June made him "fear for our country".
Referring to the vote to leave the EU, Lord Sugar said: "I was very clear in my views, I think they've made a fatal mistake."
"Lots of people are saying nothing has changed. Well, exactly. Nothing has changed because we haven't even started [the process of leaving] yet."
Lord Sugar, previously known as Sir Alan Sugar, became a peer in 2009, while Karren Brady became Baroness Brady in 2014.
So would Claude Littner like to be in line for a knighthood of his own in the future?
"To be honest it crosses my mind all the time," he joked, "but no-one has actually made me the offer".

Article: The unnamed man was stopped at Turin Airport wearing a pilot's uniform and using forged ID cards, police said.
He was charged with endangering air transport security and impersonation.
The suspect led police to a garage containing neatly pressed white shirts with epaulets, black trousers and jackets, like those worn by pilots.
No motive for the man's actions was reported immediately.
Police have established he sat as "third pilot" in the cockpit of an Air Dolomiti plane which flew from Munich to Turin in April. He did not touch the controls, however.
Air Dolomiti is part of the German airline Lufthansa, which gave no details when approached by the Associated Press news agency but insisted he could not have boarded the plane without a ticket.
Investigators are now trying to establish if the man flew on other planes.
Police had long been investigating the suspect, who had allegedly created a fake identity as a Lufthansa pilot named Andrea Sirlo, complete with a Facebook page which included fake flight attendant friends.
They said they had been alerted several months ago after he introduced himself as a captain to a civil aviation lieutenant, who became suspicious because he seemed too young for the job.
Police tracked him down from photos on his Facebook profile, in which he is apparently shown posing in uniform and sunglasses in front of planes.
Officers approached him in a bar outside Turin Airport's check-in area, dressed in a pilot's uniform with no company logo on it, and sipping coffee.
In the garage, officers also found fake IDs and fake flight theory manuals, the Italian news agency Ansa reports.
"On at least one occasion in 2012, pretending to be a pilot of a foreign commercial airline, and with a fake name, he succeeded in flying as the third pilot in the cockpit," police said in a statement.
According to Ansa, a flight took place on 6 April.
In addition, a profile on a website where users can track their flights also shows a "Pilot Andrea Sirlo" flying from Munich Airport to Turin on 23 October last year.
The case has echoes of the 2002 Hollywood film Catch Me If You Can, in which Leonardo Di Caprio played Frank Abagnale, a real-life con-man who flew as a fake Pan American pilot in the 1960s.
Sirlo is the name of a flight corridor over Turin.

Article: Alex Hartley took 4-24 and Katherine Brunt 3-35 as the hosts were bowled out for 155, despite captain Stafanie Taylor's 57.
England looked tense at 56-2 in the chase, but Nat Sciver's unbeaten 58 saw them home with 67 balls to spare.
The victory means England are one win away from World Cup qualification.
That could - and should - be achieved on the tour of Sri Lanka in November, when England will play three matches in the ICC Women's Championship.
Not only have Heather Knight's side moved a step closer to booking a place in the home tournament in 2017, they have secured an impressive series victory in her first overseas tour in charge.
Without wicketkeeper Sarah Taylor, who remains on a break from the game to deal with an anxiety problem, and injured pace bowler Anya Shrubsole, they have beaten the World Twenty20 champions in hot, humid conditions and on slow, spin-friendly surfaces.
It is those conditions that have made run-scoring so difficult and the toss so important - in all four previous matches the side batting first had gone on to win.
England again had to field first, albeit the later sunshine made batting easier in the afternoon, and their bowlers ensured the run-chase would be manageable.
After Brunt and Georgia Elwiss removed Shaquana Quintyne and Hayley Matthews respectively, Hartley and fellow spinner Laura Marsh got to work on the middle order.
With Marsh providing the squeeze from one end, Hartley's accuracy induced poor strokes from Deandra Dottin, Merissa Aguilleira and Shemaine Campbelle.
Taylor once again held the innings together with her third half-century in the five matches, but when she was stumped it gave Hartley a 13th wicket of the series, an England record in ODIs.
With Brunt and off-spinner Knight running through the lower order, West Indies lost their last five wickets for 24 runs.
England were in a strong position chasing 224 in the fourth ODI, only to give away five run-outs in a 42-run defeat.
Here, they were restricted by West Indies' spinners early on, Lauren Winfield chipping Matthews to mid-wicket for 12 and Tammy Beaumont caught and bowled by Afy Fletcher for 34.
With tension rising, the hosts threatened to find a way back into the match, especially with Knight dropped by Anisa Mohammed at short fine leg on only three.
But the skipper combined with Sciver to reverse the pressure, scoring freely down the ground and, at one point, adding 26 runs in three overs.
Though Knight was caught behind off impressive leg-spinner Fletcher, Sciver found an ally in the busy Danielle Wyatt on the way to her sixth ODI half-century.
Wyatt was brilliantly caught at long-on by Britney Cooper, and Elwiss was bowled by Dottin, but there was to be no England wobble, with Amy Jones hitting the runs that sealed the series.
England head coach Mark Robinson told BBC Sport: "It's absolutely outstanding. We've had it tough. It's been ever so humid, red hot, and the wickets have been massively challenging.
"We've come to their back yard, they were on a high after winning the World T20 and we've shown a lot of character. I'm really proud of them.
"Hartley is a tough cookie. She doesn't shy from hard work and she's bowled outstandingly. She's got a big future if she keeps working hard.
"We're a young team and we're learning as we go. We feel we're going in the right direction and we feel we have shown everybody what we're made of."
Ex-England batter Lydia Greenway on BBC Test Match Special:
"England have shown a huge amount of character. Everyone in this series has played their part.
"There have been little turning points in individuals' careers, like Lauren Winfield playing consistently.
"A sign of a good team is showing consistency in all different kinds of situations and I'm sure they will want to carry that on when they go to Sri Lanka."

England put in a dominant display to win the fifth and final one-day international against West Indies by five wickets and take the series 3-2.

Article: The UK must go further to ensure those settling learn English "so they can be more integrated into our country".
Asked about the issue at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Cameron said the last government had made progress on the issue, but more had to be done.
He agreed parents should be responsible for making sure children speak English.
Conservative MP for Keighley Kris Hopkins asked if the PM agreed that there was "a responsibility and an obligation" on parents to make sure their children can speak English when they start school.
Mr Cameron replied: "I completely agree... in too many cases this isn't happening."
Since last autumn, people from outside the EU applying for a visa to join their spouse or partner now have to prove they have a basic command of English before their application is approved.
Previously, visa applicants had to show only that their marriage or partnership was genuine and that they could financially support themselves.
The prime minister told the Commons: "The last government did make some progress on making sure people learnt English when they came to our country, I think we need to go further.
"If you look at the figures for the number of people who are brought over as husbands and wives, particularly from the Indian sub-continent, we should be putting in place - and we will be putting in place -  tougher rules to make sure they do learn English and so when they come, if they come, they can be more integrated into our country."
The weekly session of Prime Minister's Questions was dominated by foreign affairs with Labour leader Ed Miliband focusing all his six questions on events in Egypt and the UK's mission in Afghanistan.
Mr Miliband, who visited Afghanistan for the first time as Labour leader last week, paid an extended tribute to soldiers' work there, acknowledged the difference in the Commons session from the normal political point scoring.
Mr Cameron welcomed the opportunity to have a "serious conversation" about the work of British soldiers in Afghanistan, saying they wanted politicians to discuss their efforts, although he also noted  many MPs often "preferred a bunfight" about domestic issues.

Prime Minister David Cameron previously said the plan was a "very good idea".
Royal Mail spokesman Simon Fellman said: "We're delighted to do it and we're pleased so many people are delighted about it."
The Royal Mail has painted more than 50 postboxes gold following Team GB's gold medal haul at London 2012.
Originally it said it was only painting them in "winners' home towns, or towns with which they are closely associated".
Town mayor Elizabeth Hodgkin said: "We are the home of rowing... I feel very excited about it.
"I think it's wonderful news, it's a great thing for the town."
Mr Fellman said: "It's almost like the torch has come again. It's a piece of the Olympics coming back to people's doorsteps.
"The support for the boxes, it's kind of like the new tourist attraction. It's fantastic and I think people have really taken it to their hearts."

Article: The Joseph Rowntree Foundation said the number of children in working families in poverty rose by 22,000 between 2003 and 2013.
Chief executive Julia Unwin said action to help pensioners was balanced by a "worrying rise" in working people struggling to "make ends meet".
The UK government said its plan for a national living wage would help people.
"Work is the best route out of poverty and employment in Wales is at record levels," a spokesman said.
A Welsh government spokesman added: "Despite recent improvements to the Welsh economy, we do, however, recognise in-work poverty is a growing issue and are working hard to support low-income households and deliver more well-paid jobs for the Welsh economy.
"We are helping more adults access full-time employment, supporting second-earners into work and are also improving people's skills to enable them to progress in the workplace."
People are classed as being in poverty if their household earns or receives less than 60% of the national average income of around Â£450 a week, adjusted for family size.

Article: Speaking on TV, Maria Zakharova said Jews had told her they donated both to Mr Trump and Hillary Clinton.
She joked that American Jews were the best guide to US politics.
The diplomat's remarks caused shock. Anti-US propagandists in the last century peddled an idea that rich New York Jews controlled US politics.
Ms Zakharova was speaking on a chat show on Russian state TV at the weekend but her comments drew more attention after being picked up by media outlets on Thursday.
She said she had visited New York with an official Russian delegation at the time of the last UN General Assembly, in September.
"I have a lot of friends and acquaintances there, of course I was interested to find out: how are the elections going, what are the American people's expectations?" she said.
"If you want to know what will happen in America, who do you need to talk to? You have to talk to the Jews, of course. It goes without saying."
At this, the TV studio audience applauded loudly.
"I went here and there among them, to chat," she continued.
Imitating a Jewish accent, Mrs Zakharova said Jewish people had told her: "'Marochka, understand this - we'll donate to Clinton, of course. But we'll give the Republicans twice that amount.' Enough said! That settled it for me - the picture was clear.
"If you want to know the future, don't read the mainstream newspapers - our people in Brighton [Beach] will tell you everything."
She was referring to a district of Brooklyn with a large diaspora of Jewish emigres from the former Soviet Union.
Russian opposition activist Roman Dobrokhotov wrote on Twitter (in Russian) that the spokeswoman had "explained Trump's victory as a Jewish conspiracy".
Michael McFaul, the former US ambassador to Moscow, commented on Facebook, "Wow. And this is the woman who criticizes me for not being diplomatic."
During the election campaign, Mrs Clinton accused Mr Trump of posting a "blatantly anti-Semitic" tweet after he used an image resembling the Star of David and stacks of money.
Mr Trump, whose son-in-law Jared Kushner is Jewish, dismissed the accusation as "ridiculous".
An exit poll by US non-profit J Street suggests an overwhelming majority of US Jews voted for Hillary Clinton in the presidential election.

Article: What did the court say?
Until now, those employing mobile workers who had to travel to get to or from their first or last appointment of the day were not required to count that time as work.
On Thursday, the European Court of Justice judgement ruled those without a fixed or habitual office should consider the time they spend travelling between their homes and the premises of their first and last jobs as part of their hours for the day.
The ruling relates to the Working Time Directive - the European initiative which caps the working week at 48 hours. In the UK, employees have the option of opting out of the directive.
I'm a care worker who travels to different patients' homes. Am I affected?
Possibly, yes.
Employees who fall into the category loosely defined as "mobile workers" - those who habitually travel to different places of work - could be affected.
Simon Bond, an employment specialist at Higgs and Sons solicitors, says the most obvious group to fall under this definition is carers not already paid for travelling to their first and last jobs. Sales people who travel between sites and employee workmen and women, such as plumbers or electricians, could also fall into this category.
As many as 975,000 people in the UK could fall under the remit of the ruling, says Paul Sellers, a policy officer at the TUC.
And some employees could be working an extra 10 hours a week once travelling time is counted, Chris Tutton, an employment lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, adds.
I travel a lot for work, but I have a permanent office
The ruling is less likely to affect people who work both in an office and remotely. If your contract includes a permanent base, you are unlikely to be able to successfully argue you are a mobile worker, Mr Sellers says.
There may, however, be cases where it is possible to argue that a permanent base is meaningless because of the length of time spent outside the office.
I have to commute two hours every day to my office
For those with a permanent office (however lengthy your commute), this ruling will not have an effect. Mr Sellers says this final group is the "overwhelming majority" in the UK.
I think I'm affected. Should I expect a pay rise or a change in my hours?
The ruling could eventually affect pay. Unions say the ruling does not directly deal with remuneration, focussing instead on working hours and conditions. But it is possible the European judgement will be used in UK courts to challenge employers who pay an average hourly rate under the minimum wage (once travelling time is taken into account).
That could mean employers facing increased wage bills and raises an outside chance costs for some services, such as cleaners who have to travel and are paid a low wage, could go up.
It could also lead to a change in working patterns - especially for those who do not choose to opt out of the 48-hour maximum.
"I think some employers will look at where they're sending staff - they might try to make sure that the first and last shifts are as close to home as possible because they don't want to eat into that working time that they have," Mr Tutton said.
We have been contacted by BBC News website readers in response to the European judges' ruling.
Here is a selection of their comments:
This is great news for the likes of me and my engineers. We work in the telecoms industry visiting multiple sites daily. We don't get paid travel time but are expected to be onsite for 9am and leave the last site at 5pm wherever that may be. If the sites are two hours away from home this adds four hours to our day that we don't get paid for, so we do a 12-hour day for eight hours work. Steve Carroll, Manchester
I am a sales rep. My hours of work are 35, working nine to five. I leave my house most days at 6am as I work on the M25 strip so it takes three to four hours to get to my first appointment. I might get home at 7pm with no lunch break. I can drive for seven hours total per day, that's before my day working. I feel fed up, very tired and underpaid. I don't know what my rights are! Erica, Cambridge
I am a pest control technician. My colleagues and I sometimes end up doing 11 or 12-hour days. These lost hours travelling can take its toll on missed family time. The amount of time driving both during the working day and the travelling time to and from work can sometimes be as much as six hours a day depending on where our jobs take us. Paul Godfrey, Swindon
I currently leave for work - as a service engineer - earlier than my first job to ensure I'm at my first site by 10am. It's wrong that I should use my time as the further away it is the more my own time is used. We also do not have a structured break time and I've worked over 11 hours without a break and it's a constant driving service job. Barry Corbett, Glasgow
I am a mobile gas fitter and I am expected to travel to my first appointment and from my last appointment in my own time which can add 10 hours to my working week. Mark Hannon, Castleford
I'm a gas repair engineer. We have no offices. Our policy is to be on the patch of work or at our "pickup" point by 8am. With heavy traffic I leave home at 7.20am. This leaves me with 40 minutes of extra travel time. Also I could be working miles away from home at the end of day resulting in a huge variance of time out. Daniel Richards-Smith, Dorset
I am a homecare worker, taking care of people in their own home. I do not get paid for travelling to work or in between appointments. Sometimes I can travel up to 50 miles a day. We get paid 30p per hour of care delivered in a day. This is not petrol money as the carers who walk between calls also get paid this. Sometimes we have to sit in our cars because it is too early to go in to the client, anywhere from 10 minutes to up to and hour as we often are too far away from home to make it feasible to travel home. Susan Turnbull, Barnsley
I'm a healthcare assistant and while I agree with being paid for time it takes to travel I can also see this as having a knock on affect to the clients as the money to pay us would have to come from somewhere. Susan Bird, Kent

The government also said that no more than seven main dishes can be served to "ensure that there is no wastage of any food items".
An MP has also proposed a bill to impose a similar ban on expensive weddings across India.
Weddings are expensive in Kashmir, and the traditional feast, locally called Wazwan, includes a range of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes.
The state government said the order, which comes into effect from 1 April, was issued in response to public complaints about extravagance, waste and intrusive noise.
The state had imposed a similar ban in 1984, but it was revoked after protests.
Marriages are costly in other parts of India as well, and many people spend lavishly on food, clothes and entertainment.
In November, the five-day wedding of businessman and former Karnataka state minister G Janardhana Reddy's daughter, Brahmani, with an estimated cost of about 5bn rupees ($74m; £59m), prompted outrage as millions of Indians struggled with a cash flow crisis.
Among the extravagances were gold-plated invitation cards fitted with LCD screens, costing 10m rupees.

They said parents had been taken by surprise by the government's decision to reopen schools with only four days' notice and many were not prepared.
More than 8,400 people have died in West Africa in the world's worst outbreak of the Ebola virus.
The reopening of schools in Guinea comes four days after the UN said the number of confirmed Ebola cases in the country had fallen to its lowest weekly total since August.
At one school in the Guinean capital, Conakry, only about 220 of the approximately 2,000 pupils were reported to have returned.
Of the 36 teachers, more than half were back at work.
Many schools have introduced health precautions, including hand-washing and temperature checks.
Ebola has had a severe impact not only on public health but also on the Guinean economy.
Unemployment and underemployment have risen, leaving many parents with difficulties meeting school-related expenses at the beginning of a new academic year.
Schools remain closed in Sierra Leone and Liberia, the two other countries hit hard by the Ebola outbreak.

Article: The station was evacuated shortly before 09:00 BST and trains did not stop at the station for nearly two hours.
Pictures on social media showed smoke billowing out from a Bakerloo line train sitting on a platform.
Transport for London (TFL) said the fire was caused by an electrical fault.
The station reopened and services resumed at around 10:50.
London Ambulance Service said it treated four people at Oxford Circus for smoke inhalation, two of whom were taken to hospital as a precaution.
BBC journalist Katie Silver was in the station at the time. She said: "I was coming off the Victoria Line but there was smoke as you walked past the Bakerloo Line and there was the smell of smoke and burning plastic.
"We were all being evacuated. Some people were running up the escalator but they had shut certain exits, although it was very orderly.
"When we got out there were a couple of people crying. I think they were scared."
TFL said a "comprehensive investigation" would take place.
Nigel Holness, London Underground's director of network operations, said: "The cause of the smoke was an electrical fault under one of the carriages, which resulted in a small fire that was quickly extinguished.
"Understandably this was a distressing incident for our customers, for which I give my sincere apologies."
If you are ever in a Tube station and hear the announcement "would Inspector Sands please go to the operations room immediately", you may find that you are asked to leave the station a few minutes later.
The message, which can be heard in the above video clip, is an automated message which is activated when the station fire alarm sounds.
TFL says the message gives them an opportunity to investigate why the fire alarm is operating.
It is a safety mechanism that has been agreed with the London Fire Brigade (LFB) and is the same system used in major national rail stations and airports in the UK.
LFB is continuing to investigate the cause of the fire.
It said it was called to attend at 08:47 and the station had been evacuated before fire crews arrived.
Tom Singer, who was at Oxford Circus station at the time, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme he saw a smoke-filled Bakerloo line Tube train coming into the platform.
"As we were waiting on the platform you could smell something coming in, as the train was coming in, and as it got closer the smell got stronger and stronger."
He added that as the train came in it was clear passengers had been moved from one of the carriages, and then when the train came to a stop people "came pouring out".
He said: "There were a lot of people with hands over mouths and coughing a lot coming off of the train.
"It looked like it was just one carriage that had the problem."
He said he also saw smoke coming from underneath the Tube train.

On Friday the index closed 2.8% lower, while markets in Paris and Frankfurt saw falls of about 3%.
Shares also plunged on Wall Street, with the Dow Jones, Nasdaq and S&P 500 indexes all down more than 3% by the close.
Only one company on the FTSE 100 saw gains on Friday - Royal Mail, which rose by 1.6%.
The FTSE 100 has fallen for nine sessions in a row, its longest losing streak since 2011. It is almost 13% below an all-time high hit in April.
In the US, the S&P 500 suffered its biggest daily percentage drop in nearly four years on Friday, losing 64.8 points, or 3.19%, to 1,970.89.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 3.12%, and the Nasdaq dropped 3.52%.
As well as global stock markets, US oil prices also dived on Friday, with New York crude dipping below $40 a barrel for the first time since the financial crisis and marking its longest weekly losing streak since 1986.
Earlier, data from China indicated factory output in August shrank at its fastest pace in more than six years.
The private Caixin/Markit manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) dropped to 47.1 from 47.8 in July. A figure below 50 indicates contraction.
The data triggered another sell-off in Chinese shares, which ended the day down more than 4%.
The decline comes on the heels of weaker-than-expected economic data in July, plus this month's yuan devaluation and a stock market plunge.
Investors are growing increasingly concerned, as the Shanghai Composite index is now down 12% this week.
Friday's factory output reading for China was the lowest since March 2009, during the depths of the global financial crisis, and the sixth consecutive below the 50-point level.
The Caixin flash PMI is the earliest economic measure of the Chinese economy to be released each month and is closely watched for clues on how growth is faring.
Earlier in August, China's official economic growth data showed a further slowdown in the past quarter, expanding 7% compared with a year earlier, its slowest pace since 2009.
In 2014, China's economy grew at its slowest pace since 1990. It expanded by 7.4%, missing its annual growth target of 7.5% for the first time in 15 years.
Since June this year, stock exchanges on the mainland have seen extreme volatility, undermining investor confidence and leading to government intervention.
Nicholas Teo, market analyst with CMC markets, warned that China's slumping economy could dash hopes for a global recovery.
"China today is no longer just the 'factory' of the world. It is an important consumer of the world's products and services. Many companies and industries depend on the Chinese consumers who are now 'disadvantaged' in purchasing power," he said.
"So when it sneezes', many around the globe may just catch a cold."
Greater China economist Julia Wang at HSBC warned that economic recovery continued to lose momentum with "further policy-easing measures, from monetary easing to fiscal support needed".
But other analysts warned against overreacting to the current situation.
AMP Capital's chief economist Shane Oliver described the situation as a "global share market correction", pointing out that emerging markets were "arguably much stronger than in 1997-98, with stronger current account balances and higher foreign exchange reserves".
Beijing has struggled to stabilise the country's stock markets, which have fallen sharply since mid-June.
Earlier this month, the central bank stunned global markets by taking steps to devalue the country's currency, the yuan, allowing it more freedom to fluctuate in line with market developments.
The move was widely seen as an attempt to prop up the country's ailing export sector, making Chinese goods cheaper abroad.

Article: The £155,000 Bike2Go project was the first of its kind in Scotland and it was hoped it could go into other areas.
However, Dumfries and Galloway Council is not including the scheme in a planned regional rollout of initiatives to reduce car journeys.
Since its launch in September 2010 the bikes have been hired 2,270 times - a daily average of about two rentals.
The scheme was set up to encourage people to get "out of their cars and onto their bicycles".
It provides bikes free of charge to subscribers at 11 locations across the town.
It is based on similar schemes in Paris, Barcelona, Stockholm and one in London which clocked up one million journeys in its first 10 weeks.
The Dumfries project has struggled to increase rental levels since it started.
After 10 weeks they averaged about 20-a-week, with winter weather being blamed for the low uptake.
The council promised a marketing campaign to encourage increased use of the bikes.
A poor summer was again blamed for low uptake in 2012.
Plans were then proposed to make the bikes available to all council staff when on business in Dumfries.
However, some councillors questioned the value of the scheme which has 171 members on latest figures.
One suggested it would have been cheaper to buy them all a bicycle and said the project was "in danger of becoming an embarrassment".

The cost of a bike hire scheme in Dumfries works out at more than £60 per rental, new figures show.

Article: Seventeen-year-old Sylvia Fleming was pregnant when she was murdered in Omagh in 1998 by Stephen Scott.
He was sentenced to life, but has been taking part in a pre-release scheme.
The prison service said the Victim Information Scheme (PRVIS) gives victims an opportunity to provide and receive information about prisoners.
Miss Fleming went missing in April 1998.
Her body parts were found under the foundations of a partially-built house eight weeks later.
Sentencing Scott in 2000, the judge described him as "thoroughly evil".
He said: "The manner in which her body was disposed of after her murder is surely the most gruesome.
"I am satisfied that you, Scott, not only deliberately killed this young girl but that you planned that killing and carried it out in circumstances so squalid that they would revolt any right-thinking person."
Her sister, Josie Fleming, told BBC Radio Foyle she was contacted by someone who had spotted the killer painting a fence.
"Even though we knew the time was coming we are angry and fearful," she said.
"They need to let us know when he is due for his official release - it's important for us to know when this evil person will be free to walk the streets."
Miss Fleming said she believes Scott is "capable of anything" and should never be freed.
"He took her into his flat, he tied her up in a bed and put a blindfold over her eyes and covered her mouth with tape," Ms Fleming said.
"He injected her with insulin and when she passed away he put her in the attic and then took her down and put her in the bath to cut her up."
"You never can come to terms with what happened, we're learning to live with it but we'll never, ever get over it."
In a statement, the prison service said those who register with the Victim Information Scheme will get details about a person convicted of a crime against them.
They will receive details about any temporary release a prisoner is granted,  the month and year in which a prisoner is expected to be released, any conditions of the prisoner's release and any breaches of those conditions which result in the prisoner's return to custody.
In the case of life-sentence prisoners, the victim can obtain information about the minimum number of years the life prisoner must serve, when the life prisoner is being considered for release and have the opportunity to give views when the prisoner is considered for final release.

Article: The video posted by Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov, a strong Putin ally, portrayed Mr Kasyanov though a sniper's gun sights.
Mr Kadyrov has criticised social network Instagram for removing it.
Speaking to BBC News, Mr Kasyanov said Mr Putin was responsible for Mr Kadyrov's actions.
"He is one of the 45 governors of the [Russian] regions, appointed personally by Mr Putin, and Mr Putin is responsible for his behaviour personally," he told the BBC's Sarah Rainsford.
"He is supposed to stop his undertakings... but unfortunately there's no reaction. The fact that Putin who is guarantor of constitution doesn't stop Kadyrov - means it's some kind of silent encouragement at least."
Putin loyalist Kadyrov unleashed on Russian 'traitors'
Ramzan Kadyrov: Putin's key Chechen ally
Mr Kasyanov, who served as President Putin's prime minister from 2000 to 2004, now leads Parnas, a small liberal opposition party.
He and other Russian opposition politicians have described the sniper video, which appeared after the Chechen leader called Mr Putin's critics "enemies" and "traitors", as a murder threat.
"They want to intimidate us and continue to create pressure on the opposition," Mr Kasyanov said.
"The main purpose is pressure on the opposition. To make fear. So that we stop our active policy."
He described Mr Kadyrov as "one of the most outrageous pieces" of the current Russian political system.
"Like all people in Russia, we should all be worried about what is going on," Mr Kasyanov said.
"But we've chosen our way and we have to stand up and continue to do our job."
The former prime minister argued that a campaign of intimidation was under way because the Kremlin feared the opposition speaking out about the economic crisis and other issues.
"That's why they are afraid of us," he said. "Because we will describe  who is responsible for the problems of the people."
Instagram said the controversial video had "violated the requirement to respect other members" of the social network.
Mr Kadyrov, who has ruled Chechnya with an iron fist for nearly a decade with the support of the Kremlin, suppressing separatism, accused Instagram of bowing to US pressure.
In a new Instagram post, he said he had been punished for saying a "few words about the USA's guard dogs".
"You can write anything you want, but do not touch America's dogs, friends of the Department of State and Congress," he said. "You know very well whom I am talking about!"
Last March Mr Kadyrov spoke out on Instagram about the assassination of opposition figure Boris Nemtsov in Moscow, defending one of the Chechens charged over the shooting.
A day later President Putin gave Mr Kadyrov a top award.
Nemtsov, also a leading member of Parnas, was among several well-known opponents of Mr Putin assassinated in the past decade.

Article: The Beyond Caravaggio exhibition features the work of the Italian artist and 30 other artists from all over Europe who were influenced by him.
It is a collaboration with the National Galleries in London and Dublin.
Edinburgh is the last stop for the works inspired by the man known as the "bad boy" of early 17th Century art.
This is the first exhibition of works by Caravaggio and his followers ever to be shown in Scotland.
Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio was just 39 when he died in 1610.
Four years earlier he had murdered a man after a quarrel over a game of tennis and spent the rest of his life as a fugitive.
Christopher Baker, the acting director of the Scottish National Gallery, told BBC Scotland that Caravaggio was a "revolutionary artist".
He said: "You could see him as the archetypal bad boy artist who in his private life has a tempestuous time, who behaves appallingly, who is often in the courts and who is on the run having committed murder.
"In addition to all of that he is a great creative force.
"He produces these extraordinary pictures, which unsurprisingly, had an extraordinary impact and inspired other painters, who travelled to Rome and Naples from right across Europe and thought 'I need to do that, I want a piece of that as well'.
"That is the story this exhibition tells."
One of the paintings in the exhibition, The Taking of Christ (1602), is from the National Gallery of Ireland, where it is on indefinite loan from the Jesuit Community in Dublin.
It was rediscovered in 1990 in a Jesuits' residence in the Irish capital.
Aidan Weston-Lewis, the curator of exhibition at the Scottish National Gallery, said it was "frustrating" to think that it was offered to the Scottish National Gallery for free in 1921 and turned down.
He said it was the only painting by Caravaggio that has ever been in a Scottish private collection.
It was bought by Scottish country gentleman William Hamilton Nisbet in Rome in 1802, directly from the Mattei family who had commissioned it 200 years earlier.
The painting was on display at Biel House in East Lothian for 120 years.
Mr Weston-Lewis said: "His descendants bequeathed a large group of pictures from that collection to the Scottish National Gallery.
"We didn't have space for them all.
"They were paraded in front of the trustees at the next board meeting and some were selected and some weren't.
"Very sadly from our point of view this painting got away. It was turned down."
Mr Weston-Lewis said the painting had been mistakenly re-attributed to a Caravaggio follower but even so the reputation of the Italian artist was so low at this time that the painting would not have been thought worth saving.
He said: "There was a degree of ignorance. It was only in the middle of the 20th Century that his reputation was resurrected fully.
"Now one could argue he's probably the most popular of all Old Master painters, or certainly up there among them."
Caravaggio's dramatic lighting and compositions, and his radically new approach to subject matter, exerted a huge influence on artists such as Gentileschi, Ribera, Valentin and Ter Brugghen.
Mr Baker said: "It is not just the style of painting but the new types of subject matter, often secular subjects that he excelled at producing, that thrilled other people.
"But also it's gaming, being in pubs, misbehaving, having a good time, this heady world of pleasure comes into painting at this moment through him, and that's what everybody else wants a bit of."
The four paintings by Caravaggio to be shown in the exhibition include The Supper at Emmaus (1601) and Boy bitten by a Lizard (about 1594-5) as well as The Taking of Christ (1602).
Ribera's The Martyrdom of St Bartholomew (1634), which was in the Cranstoun family collection at Corehouse in Lanarkshire for more than 170 years, has been borrowed for this exhibition from the National Gallery of Art in Washington.
Another painting, Christ displaying his Wounds (c.1625-35) by Spadarino, has been borrowed from Perth Museum and Art Gallery.
Beyond Caravaggio is on display at the National Galleries in Scotland from 17 June to 24 September. Entrance to the exhibit costs Â£12.

Four paintings by Renaissance Old Master Caravaggio are the centrepiece of a major exhibition at the National Galleries of Scotland.

Article: But there was nothing expected about the way his Manchester United side claimed their first away win of the season.
"If Arsenal had scored in the first 20 minutes then it is a different game," said the United boss. "And then maybe I have to respond to all the questions asking why I chose the three centre-backs. But now I can laugh."
The joke ended up being on Arsenal's attacking players rather than the unlikely trio of defenders that Van Gaal had picked - Chris Smalling, Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair - who surprisingly held out until Olivier Giroud's ferocious strike in stoppage time.
Saturday evening's defeat was not the same old story for the Gunners either - they did not take the lead this time, for starters.
And while we already knew that both teams are unlikely to mount a title challenge, there were still things to be learned from a game billed as the battle for fourth place.
Media playback is not supported on this device
It had taken United until the 85th minute to muster a shot on target, with Kieran Gibbs' bizarre own goal gifting them the lead before Wayne Rooney's late strike prevented the game finishing with that odd statistic.
As well as his first away win as United boss, this was arguably the first win under Van Gaal that had been earned by his defence.
Arsene Wenger was keen to point out that David De Gea was man of the match at Emirates Stadium but in truth the United keeper made a lot of saves he would be expected to make, rather than any truly outstanding ones.
Or as Van Gaal put it: "Most of his saves were from outside the area and from that distance the goalkeeper has more advantage than the player shooting."
The biggest reason De Gea's recently dislocated finger was not truly tested was United's makeshift backline, something few people expected to be saying before this game when they saw the team sheet with the names of Smalling, McNair and Blackett on it.
A fourth clean sheet of the season looked even less likely when one of the wing-backs, Luke Shaw, was forced off after 16 minutes to be replaced by Ashley Young - who according to his manager is not fully fit.
At that stage, Arsenal were rampant and it seemed a case of when they would score, not if. But instead of collapsing, United stood firm.
Smalling, who is not viewed as natural leader, marshalled the youngsters either side of him. In front of them, Michael Carrick and Marouane Fellaini added much-needed bite to midfield.
Together they earned Van Gaal a win that moved his side up to fourth in the table - something he seemed surprised about when he was told.
While United can - justifiably - claim to be making progress, the raw statistics demonstrate Arsenal are going backwards.
A year ago, they beat Southampton 2-0 and were four points clear at the top of the table with 28 points from 12 games.
Fast forward 12 months and Wenger's men have 11 points fewer at the same stage, and trail leaders Chelsea by 15 points.
Yes, fourth place is still in their reach - United, in the last of the Champions League places, are only two points ahead. Framed like that, this campaign is not yet a disaster.
Media playback is not supported on this device
But after ending their trophy drought by winning the FA Cup, and following that up with a summer of heavy investment, Arsenal fans can be forgiven for thinking their title challenge should have lasted longer than it did last season, when it faded in the New Year.
Instead it is all but over before most people have put their Christmas decorations up.
Some are making their frustrations heard - such as the Gunners fan in front of the press box on Saturday who held aloft a sign reading "Enough is Enough - Wenger out".
But the majority remained with their manager on this occasion, perhaps because this defeat was unlike most of their setbacks this season.
This time, it was misfortune that cost them the initiative in a game, rather than any ill-advised attempts to extend their lead.
Gibbs' collision with Wojciech Szczesny that led to the full-back's own goal and ended the keeper's involvment in the game was pure farce.
It would be unkind to compare the duo's actions to the antics of Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels, the stars of new film 'Dumb and Dumber To' who were at Emirates Stadium to watch the game.
But you get the feeling their characters Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunne would definitely have approved.
United's second goal was much more familiar to Arsenal fans, with their team being caught up the pitch and exposed on the break - but at least this time it was because they were chasing the game.
Wenger's team have obvious shortcomings but they were not behind this defeat and his side did not get what they deserved against United. Instead it was just one of those nights.

Article: Amelia Welch, 20, from Axminster in Devon, was partying with friends in Plymouth on Friday when she lost her hand, which cost about Â£3,000.
The Plymouth University marine biology student said she only realised the cosmetic prosthetic was missing the following morning.
She thinks she could have left it in a nightclub and forgot to pick it up.

Amelia, who was born with a congenital malformation in her right hand, said she had gone to Oceana nightclub after a university ball.
Her hand is "more functionable" without the prosthetic which has very little movement, she said.
"I do take it off to go to the toilet, but most of the time when I go out I put it on because it gives me confidence," she said.
"I must have been drunk when I took it off and forgot about it.
"I went back to halls with friends and went to bed and the next day I realised that I did not have it."
It is the first prosthetic she has had and fits on her hand "like a glove" she said.
Another one could cost as much as Â£5,000 and mean many hours of visits to orthopaedic specialists.
"Someone might have picked it up and not realised what it was," she said.
"It's worth everything to me, but nothing to anyone else."

Article: The Aberdeenshire-based company said there had been an "unprecedented response" to its Equity for Punks USA crowdfunding initiative.
BrewDog hopes to raise up to $50m within six months to help fund expansion in North America.
Plans include a new 100,000 sq ft brewery in Columbus, Ohio.
It is scheduled to open later this year.
Shares in the funding round cost $47.50 each, with a minimum investment of $95. According to BrewDog, more than 1,200 people have already signed up to the scheme.
On its website, the company said: "This unprecedented response to our first crowdfunding round in the States shows the demand for our beer in America, and sets us up with a community of like-minded individuals ready and waiting to help us make our US business an explosive success."
Its Equity for Punks USA investment scheme is the fifth fundraising venture by the brewery, and its first in the US.
The Ellon-based company has raised more than £26m since launching its first Equity for Punks crowdfunding round in 2009.
Its last UK round raised £19m to fund growth plans, including expanding its brewery in Ellon and opening new bars. The round, which closed in April, fell short of its £25m target.
BrewDog's British business now employs more than 600 people globally and exports to 55 countries. It also operates more than 40 bars in the UK and overseas.

Article: Many lizards can detach their tails when attacked, but fish-scale geckos have large scales that tear away with ease.
The new species is a master of this art, say scientists, having the largest scales of any known gecko.
The reptile, named Geckolepis megalepis, is described in PeerJ.
The skin of fish-scale geckos is specially adapted to tearing. The large scales are attached only by a relatively narrow region that tears with ease.
In addition, beneath the scales there is a pre-formed splitting zone within the skin itself.
Although several other geckos are able to lose their skin like this if they are grasped firmly, fish-scale geckos are able to do so actively - and at the slightest touch.
They can also grow them back scar-free in a matter of weeks, while other geckos might take a long time to regenerate their scales.
But Geckolepis megalepis is remarkable for the huge size of its scales. The researchers hypothesise that larger scales tear more easily than smaller ones, because of their greater surface area relative to the attachment area, and larger friction surface.
"What's really remarkable though is that these scales - which are really dense and may even be bony, and must be quite energetically costly to produce - and the skin beneath them tear away with such ease, and can be regenerated quickly and without a scar," said lead author Mark Scherz, from the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.
The new species was discovered in the Tsingy cave formations of northern Madagascar.

Article: Unions had won backing for strike action after the firm proposed closing the final salary scheme, which Tata claimed was facing a Â£2bn deficit.
Workers have now agreed to amendments to the pension scheme in return for it remaining open.
A proposed national strike scheduled for 22 June was suspended following talks at the arbitration service Acas.
Neither the unions nor Tata have given any details of the changes.
In a statement Tata Steel said the new proposal was "a fair and balanced solution".
The firm added; "The new arrangements, including the modifications to scheme benefits, will address a significant proportion of the pension scheme's projected deficit. "Other actions to be agreed with the pension Trustee will address the balance."
Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of Community, one of the four unions involved in the dispute, said the UK steel industry was still facing "challenges".
"It was apparent during this dispute that the company was not listening to the concerns of its workforce, which led to a serious breakdown in trust and confidence," he said.
"All unions have already begun a dialogue with the company to address these issues."
Tata Steel employs more than 17,000 people in its UK operation.

Article: Michal Konrad Herba, 36, was held on a European Arrest Warrant at an address in Tividale, West Midlands.
He is the brother of suspect Lukasz Pawel Herba, who is being held by Italian police after Ms Ayling was allegedly kidnapped in Milan.
Ms Ayling, 20, was allegedly abducted and held by a group calling itself "Black Death" for five days.
Michal Herba was arrested in a joint operation by West Midlands Police and East Midlands Special Operations Unit (EMSOU) and is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates Court on 17 August.
It is alleged that kidnappers attempted to sell Ms Ayling online for Â£230,000.
Ms Ayling, from Coulsdon, south London, arrived in Milan on 10 July for a photo shoot.
There, Italian police say she was attacked by two men, drugged with ketamine and abducted, apparently to be sold in an online auction.
She is believed to have been transported in a bag to an isolated village near Turin, Italy, but was released on July 17.
Ms Ayling's lawyer Francesco Pesce has said she was told she would be sold in the Middle East "for sex".
Speaking after the alleged abduction, Ms Ayling said she feared for her life throughout the "terrifying experience".
"I'm incredibly grateful to the Italian and UK authorities for all they have done to secure my safe release," she said.
Italian police documents revealed that suspect Lukasz Herba said he had got involved in order to raise money for cancer treatment.
A Polish national, who lives in Oldbury in the West Midlands, he told investigators he drove her to the British consulate in Milan and released her before the sale went ahead.
The National Crime Agency and EMSOU said it was providing specialist support to the Italian police as part of the investigation.

Article: The German investment firm, JAB Holding will pay a 78% premium to Friday's closing price to buy the company.
JAB is offering $92 a share. While more than Friday's price, it's a discount to the $157 share price high the company enjoyed in November 2014.
The deal will make JAB the biggest player in the North American single-serve coffee pod market.
"Keurig Green Mountain represents a major step forward in the creation of our global coffee platform," said JAB chairman Bart Becht, in a statement.
JAB has invested heavily in the US coffee market. It bought Caribou Coffee Co and Peet's Coffee & Tea in 2012 and formed a joint venture between coffeemakers DE Master Blenders and Mondelez International in July.
Keurig will continue to operate as an independent company after the purchase.
Coca-Cola - Keurig's biggest investors- voiced its support for the deal in a statement. Coca-Cola will take a 17.4% stake in the new private company.
"We have enjoyed a strong partnership with Keurig Green Mountain, and will continue our collaboration with JAB in order to capitalize on the growth opportunities in the single-serve, pod-based segment of the cold beverage industry," said Muhtar Kent, Coca-Cola's chief executive.
Despite the higher cost of a single-serve coffee pod compared to a cup of filter coffee, the popularity of the machines continues to grow globally.
According to Euromonitor International over the next three to five years, sales of single serve coffee pods are expected to grow by 5% in the US, 10% in Canada and 8% in Mexico. The research firm said the coffee pod business already accounts for 40% of the $15bn global coffee market.
The business is not without its critics. The plastic pods have been criticised for increasing the amount of waste in landfills
In March the creator of the K-cups, John Sylvan, told The Atlantic magazine he did not use the machine and acknowledged their cost and impact on the environment.
"I feel bad sometimes that I ever did it," Sylvan told the magazine.

Article: Under the adverse conditions, RBS's capital levels fell by 7.5 percentage points - the third biggest fall of the 51 banks tested.
However, RBS said the tests showed it had made "continued progress".
RBS was bailed out by the government in 2008 and the UK taxpayer continues to hold a 73% stake in the bank.
The health check of 51 lenders in the eurozone and the rest of the EU, including the UK, was carried out by the London-based European Banking Authority.
It examined the impact of GDP falling by about 7% between now and 2018.
Why are the banks being tested?
The Bank of England said the results for RBS and three other UK banks - Barclays, HSBC and Lloyds - were "consistent with those of previous Bank of England stress tests".
"They provide evidence that major UK banks have the resilience necessary to maintain lending to the real economy, even in a macroeconomic stress scenario," it added.
Under the test conditions, RBS was left with a capital buffer of just over 8%.
Ewen Stevenson, RBS chief financial officer, said: "The EBA stress test results demonstrate our continued progress towards transforming the balance sheet to being safe and sustainable.
"We are confident that in delivering our strategy, we will transform RBS into a low-risk, resilient bank."
Conservative former chancellor Lord Lamont urged people not to be overly concerned about RBS's position, saying it was still "well above the minimum capital" that would be required - and saying the real danger to the European economy came from continental institutions.
He told BBC's Today programme there was "work to be done" but attention should be focused on banks in Germany and Italy, as well as Portugal and Greece which were not tested because they were considered too small.
"That is where it is thought there is a lot of weakness in the European banking system," he said, warning the situation in Italy and other countries "could create a real political crisis" for Europe.
Under the test conditions, Barclays' capital buffers would fall by 4 percentage points in the event of a major economic shock, leaving it with a buffer of 7.3%.
Unlike in previous years, the EBA did not judge whether banks had passed or failed its latest tests.
In 2014, if banks had a capital buffer of 5.5% after the stress test, then they were considered healthy, and analysts use that as an informal benchmark.
Both RBS and Barclays surpassed that mark in the latest test.
Allied Irish Banks, which was bailed out by Irish taxpayers, showed a near 9 percentage points fall in capital levels in the test.
"AIB is well-capitalised and capital accretive," the bank said in a statement.
"The results published today are point-in-time projections based on prescribed stress assumptions and should not be treated as indicative of the future financial performance."
Italy's Monte dei Paschi di Siena was by far the worst performer, with the test forecasting that its capital would fall by 14 percentage points under the adverse conditions.
Shortly before the results of the stress test were released, Monte dei Paschi di Siena announced that it had secured the backing of a consortium of banks for a rescue plan.
The plan involves the sale of €9.2bn (£7.7bn) of bad loans and an injection of €5bn of fresh capital.
Founded in 1472, Monte dei Paschi is one of the world's oldest banks, but in recent years has been one of Europe's weakest, with €50bn of bad loans.
Analysts were also keen to see how German banks performed under the test conditions.
Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank were left with capital buffers of less than 8% at the end of the test.
"Commerzbank is robust and stress resistant," Commerzbank chief risk officer Marcus Chromik said in a statement.
"Even under the adverse conditions of the EBA stress scenario, the stability of the Bank would be guaranteed."
After the financial crisis of 2008, US banks took hefty charges to clean up their balance sheets, but European banks were much less aggressive, leaving them with billions of euros of poorly-performing loans.
"Whilst we recognise the extensive capital raising done so far, this is not a clean bill of health," EBA Chairman Andrea Enria said in a statement.
"There remains work to do."

Article: In a bid to promote password security, Strathclyde University produced a poster saying: "Bet Jennifer Lawrence wishes she'd used a StR0nG_Pas5w0Rd%."
The image attracted criticism on social media, with the Glasgow-based university accused of "victim blaming".
The university said the poster had been removed and should not have been made.
An image of the poster was tweeted on Monday by Billy McCauley who said: "Pretty shocking victim blaming here. Will you take it down?"
A short time later, Strathclyde University tweeted: "The posters are being removed now. They should not have produced and we are looking into how this happened."
A spokesman for the university later said: "The posters are in bad taste and have now been removed from campus. The sentiment expressed is not consistent with the values of this university."
Dozens of private pictures of Hunger Games actress Lawrence were released on the internet in September.
Other celebrities targeted in the leaks included Rihanna, Kate Upton, Selena Gomez and Kim Kardashian.
It is thought the photos were taken off the stars' iCloud accounts and were shared on other websites.

Article: An unsolicited email from Apple inviting publishers to join the service presumes acceptance of the terms, unless they actively opt out.
It requires them to cover Apple if legal issues arise, among other things.
Apple, which is due to launch the app later this year, refused to comment on the row.
The terms read: "If we receive a legal claim about your RSS content, we will tell you so that you can resolve the issue, including indemnifying Apple if Apple is included in the claim."
Agreement to that, and other terms, is a prerequisite for being included in the forthcoming app.
However, a line in the email from Apple made clear that publishers not wishing to be bound by them would be expected to say so explicitly.
That has led some to express concern that they would be bound by the agreement perhaps without ever having seen it or actively consenting to it.
Other terms in the email allow Apple to place adverts next to publishers' publicly available content without paying them.
The BBC has spoken to three online publishers about the move.
One of them, Mike Ash said he thought it was "wrong of Apple" to presume that he would indemnify them. He said the email was "presumptuous".
And, in a blogpost entitled I Do Not Agree To Your Terms, he took issue with the requirement to opt out.
He wrote: "Let me get this straight, Apple: you send me an email outlining the terms under which you will redistribute my content, and you will just assume that I agree to your terms unless I opt out?
"You're going to consider me bound to terms you just declared to me in an email as long as I don't respond? That's completely crazy. You don't even know if I received the email!"
According to Graham Hann, the head of technology, media and communications at the law firm Taylor Wessing, the terms of the deal are broadly in line with industry standards - except the requirement to opt out.
"The content of the notice is not unusual, although it has deliberately been dumbed down, possibly for clarity," he told the BBC.
"However, the optout approach is very unusual and I don't see how the notice could form a binding contract without a positive reply.
"Apple clearly wants to launch with as much content as possible and has taken this risk-based approach. Some publishers may object and even threaten to sue.
"However, I think it would be hard to claim damage beyond a reasonable royalty fee."
Apple will place the publishers' content via a publicly available RSS feed, which sends any updates to a blog or website to the host - in this case, Apple News.
Publishers make these feeds publicly available voluntarily.
After announcing the launch of the app, the company began advertising for editorial staff to work on it, indicating that it would be curated by a human editor, rather than an algorithm.
The news app is categorised as part of the firm's marketing department.
It is due to be launched with the latest operating system update - iOS9 - later in 2015.
Apple also announced at the WWDC developers' conference that it was launching a music streaming app that would include the user's music video library, as well as an internet radio station and a way for artists to share unreleased tracks.

Apple's forthcoming news app has been criticised over claims the company is hoodwinking bloggers into accepting its terms and conditions.

Article: The victim, named by police as Ali Nasrollahi, 22, was found collapsed in Barnet on Tuesday afternoon.
Mr Nasrollahi, who was found at the junction of Woodside Grange Road and Grangeway, was treated by paramedics for a single stab wound but died soon after arriving at hospital.
Police have launched a murder inquiry and have appealed for witnesses to come forward. No arrests have been made.
Det Insp Julie Willats said: "We know that the victim had driven to Woodside Grange Road with one of his friends and met up with another friend, who had also driven there.
"At some stage, the victim interacted with a group of up to four suspects, during that interaction we believe he was stabbed.
"The group of suspects then ran off down Grangeway and into an alleyway that leads on to Woodside Avenue."
The victim's friend Mohamed Musalam said: "I'm shocked... I had to call 10 people to confirm because it was just unreal.
"He didn't deserve it at all, he wasn't that sort of a person where he hangs around with the wrong crowd or anything like that.
"He was a happy guy, the sort of guy that comes into a group and makes everyone laugh. I am heartbroken."

Article: Relatives say they have evidence that she was murdered as part of a policy of deliberately killing journalists.
The wrongful death lawsuit was filed at a district court in Washington DC.
Colvin was reporting from the rebel-held area of Baba Amr, in Homs, in February 2012, when she was killed by government artillery.
Shortly before, she did live broadcasts for the BBC, Channel Four and CNN.
"I watched a little baby die today," she said, talking over pictures of a child who had been hit by a sniper bullet. "That is happening over and over and over."
She told the BBC that President Assad's forces were "shelling with impunity, with merciless disregard for civilians".
She told CNN it was "a complete and utter lie that they're only going after terroristsâ€¦ The Syrian army is simply shelling a city of cold, starving civilians".
The Colvin family believes that the satellite phone used in these broadcasts was traced by Syrian intelligence and used to locate the Baba Amr media centre, where she was based.
According to documents obtained by their lawyers, a government informant then confirmed the location. An attack on the journalists was ordered that night, the lawsuit says.
"The transmissions were intercepted, and they were tracked to their GPS co-ordinates," said one of the legal team, Scott Gilmore.
"On top of that there was a whole web of informants who were already out searching for the journalists. Any journalist in Homsâ€¦ could have been a target".
Marie's photographer, Paul Conroy, had told the BBC shortly after the attack that the incoming rounds were "bracketed" on the media centre, meaning they were being deliberately targeted.
Conroy had served in an artillery regiment in the British Army.
"As an artilleryman, I think that was a good day's work for a for a well-trained team. Nothing smacked of randomness in that situation," he said.
Now the family's lawyers say they have witnesses and documents smuggled out of Syria to prove this.
The lawsuit is the fruit of four years of research by the US-based Center for Justice and Accountability.
The documents are said to show that the artillery strike was approved or ordered by President Assad's brother Maher, commander of the Republican Guards.
The policy of targeting journalists is alleged to have been made by senior officials in the Central Crisis Management Cell, President Assad's war cabinet.
"I'm really proud to be able to bring this lawsuit," said Marie Colvin's sister, Cat. "We know who Marie's killers are now; we want them brought to justice. I want them to be held accountable."
She went on: "I'm very sensitive to the suffering of the Syrian people. I know I'm not the only one who's lost a sister and my mom is not the only one who is mourning the loss of a daughter.
"I'm in a unique position to be able to use the court to be able be bring Marie's killers to justice. I want to give a voice to the Syrian people. I want them to know we haven't forgotten them."
The shelling in Baba Amr was the most intense any of us in the BBC team had ever seen.
The Syrians there were all wondering if this would be another Hama - the town destroyed by the old President Assad's artillery in 1982. Some 10,000-20,000 people were killed - there is still no accurate estimate - but not a single image was published of the carnage.
In the age of the cameraphone and YouTube, that was not going to happen in Baba Amr.
But - we believed - the regime still feared what effect the presence of international journalists would have.
"We could destroy Baba Amr in 10 minutes, if there were no cameras," a regime official is supposed to have said, according to documents and witness statements obtained by the Colvin family's lawyers.
The lawsuit says Marie was deliberately murdered according to orders given by some of the most senior officials in the Syrian regime.
One of those who helped carry out the attack is said to have been rewarded by the Assad family with the gift of a car.
These are allegations, yet to be tested in court. But the murder of journalists is just one war crime among many of which the regime stands accused.
The Colvin family hopes the lawsuit will be a reminder of that - as some in the international community seek to rehabilitate President Assad.

The family of Marie Colvin, the American journalist who died in Syria four years ago, is suing the regime of President Bashar al-Assad.

Article: Rodgers' men thrashed Partick Thistle 5-0 on Thursday and must avoid defeat by Hearts on Sunday to finish their title-winning campaign without defeat.
"We matched 33 wins, which is the most wins in the history at Celtic," Rodgers told BBC Scotland.
"We go one behind in the record for goals. Now we're on to 104. So, we've got everything to play for."
Celtic are looking to become the first team to go a 38-game Scottish Premiership campaign unbeaten.
They have gone unbeaten in a season once before, in 1897-98, winning 15 of the 18 games played. Glasgow rivals Rangers followed suit a year later, winning all 18.
Leigh Griffiths, who would later appear to question being substituted, scored Celtic's opener at Firhill from the penalty spot after Patrick Roberts was fouled by Callum Booth.
Media playback is not supported on this device
Tom Rogic netted Celtic's second from a low Griffiths cross, and Roberts swept in their third before the break.
Strikes from outside the box by Callum McGregor and Roberts followed in the second half.
"It was a joy to watch the team," said Rodgers. "Five special goals and, fundamentally, the players worked very, very hard. It was an outstanding team performance.
"If you go 38 games of a season [unbeaten] with all the games we've had, the level of games, perform like we have done then it's a truly remarkable achievement relative to the time that we're playing in."
Asked if there was any chance of keeping Roberts, who is due to return to parent club Manchester City this summer, Rodgers replied: "I don't know. You have to respect he is a Manchester City player.
"The only thing I would ever say is if there ever is a possibility that he's going to leave Manchester City then of course Celtic would be certainly there to want to bring him here.
"I still think he's got a lot of development left in him. At 19 years of age, he still needs a lot of education, a lot of training. He's getting a wonderful education here with the club, the size of the club.
"He's a wonderful talent. He's very much a part of the team structure and that's great to see.
"When he has the ball, especially in the final third, he truly is a little magician. He was one of a number of outstanding team performers.
"He took his goals absolutely brilliantly. He's always a threat in the penalty box - gets the penalty and scores two other wonderful goals."
Partick Thistle boss Alan Archibald accepted his side had been outclassed and said of the gap between Celtic and the other top-flight clubs: "It's huge and you need to get everything right to get anything off them. The worry is the gulf could get bigger.
"They were miles ahead of us tonight and they have been all season and miles ahead of most of the league.
"We stood off them and I think Celtic could smell that fear in some of our individual battles and if you do that against a good side, they'll certainly hurt you and we gave them a gift with the opening goal, which didn't help."

Article: She will become the new Bishop of Stockport.
The Church's ruling body, the general synod, voted to allow women to become bishops in July.
The appointment will end centuries of male leadership of the Church and comes 20 years after women became priests.
Mrs Lane said: "It is a remarkable day for me and an historic day for the Church.
"This is unexpected and very exciting. On this historic day as the Church of England announces the first woman nominated to be bishop, I am very conscious of all those who have gone before me, women and men, who for decades have looked forward to this moment. But most of all I am thankful to God."
While priests are normally in charge of a church, a bishop is in charge of a large area like a county - called a diocese - with hundreds of churches.
Some people within the church are against the change because they say tradition dictates that only men should hold the most senior positions.
But supporters say there is no reason that women shouldn't be in the Church's positions of power.
Churches in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland already allow women as bishops, but haven't appointed one yet.

The game ebbed and flowed, from the brilliance of Jos Buttler, to Sri Lanka slipping to 15-4, then the hitting of Angelo Mathews taking it to the final over.
England know how destructive the competitive Mathews can be - he even scored half of his runs on one leg thanks to a problem with his left hamstring.
However, he lost strike towards the end and, after Chris Jordan repeated his knack of bowling excellent yorkers at the death, Ben Stokes was able to defend 15 off the final over.
In the end, England were good for their win. Eoin Morgan had the right men in the right places, they took pressure catches and, overall, they kept their cool. That, along with big players putting in big performances, is exactly what T20 cricket is about.
In the case of Buttler, England have never had a player so destructive or capable of batting like he does.
Media playback is not supported on this device
The Lancashire wicketkeeper, who made 66 not out from 37 balls, has a whole range of shots that, when you first see them, appear so risky.
However, Buttler has an amazing eye and he practises hard. He has established a technique that works for him, including flat-batted drives through the off side and flicks over his shoulder. He is a formidable opponent.
Alongside him is Stokes, who made a serious contribution to such a big, important match.
He hit the only ball he faced for six, ran out Lahiru Thirimanne with his first touch in the field, took a steepling catch to remove Chamara Kapugedera, then ensured Sri Lanka did not get the runs they needed off the final over.
Earlier in the tournament, Joe Root hit that magnificent 44-ball 83 to lead the chase of 230 against South Africa when defeat would have almost certainly sent England out. On Saturday, he took a brilliant catch in the 19th over.
These are key players who relish the biggest challenges and stand up when the going gets really tough.
Now, England head to a semi-final, almost certainly against New Zealand on Wednesday, with the advantage of having played twice on this Delhi ground.

While the Kiwis, unbeaten in topping Group 2, have been relying on their spinners on slow pitches, England have been playing a different, more pace-influenced game.
Even with that advantage, England will be the least fancied of the semi-finalists, regardless of who makes it through out of India and Australia on Sunday.
But, as we have been saying all along in this tournament, no team has ever gone through an entire World T20 unbeaten and the eventual winners will be the side that peaks at the right time.
The last four teams have only two games between them and the trophy. The semis and final will be incredibly difficult to predict because Twenty20 is hard to consistently play well - there's always a different area of your game coming under attack.
England should at least be confident of giving a good account of themselves. They are happier chasing, but they have won two games batting first.
If everything clicks, and they still have not played a match in this tournament where all departments have - against Sri Lanka the spinners went for a combined 63 runs in four overs - then they have a real chance.
When it comes to the pressure moments in a Twenty20, all you can do is stay calm and try to remain in control, even if you are under the cosh.
That is what England did against Sri Lanka and, if they can do it in two more matches, they have a chance of repeating the success of 2010.

Article: So, it's no small achievement that Star Citizen's creator says he has raised more than $108m (Â£75m) to develop the title via online crowdfunding campaigns.
In fact, it makes the sci-fi space simulator the biggest crowdfunded project of all time.
Not bad considering its creator, Chris Roberts, had originally hoped to raise about a tenth of the amount.
That would have funded a much smaller game than Star Citizen has evolved into, Roberts told the BBC.
"I never thought we would raise the money we have, I was going to start more contained and over time its sort of filled out," he said.
But with the title running years behind its originally announced schedule, he has still to prove he can meet the backers' expectations.
Roberts is famous among video game fans for the popular 1990's spaceship combat Wing Commander series.
The popularity of these games built Roberts a huge fan base, which dug into its own pockets to fund his new PC game.
Roberts' development company is called Cloud Imperium. It operates four studios spread across three different countries (the US, UK and Germany), all working to realise Star Citizen's grand vision.
It's what's known as a massively multiplayer online (MMO) game, which allows the player to pilot space ships, big and small, and even become part of the crew on huge vessels.
The universe is planned to be a huge explorable sandbox. Players should be able to engage in first-person combat, spaceship racing, visiting and exploring space stations and planets.
It is a persistent universe of huge ambition - so ambitious it's taking much longer to develop than originally anticipated.
The game was first announced back in 2012, with a release planned for 2014.
But at present only small taster portions of the game are available to play.
Inevitably some backers and internet observers have taken to forums and blogs to vent their anger at the delays.
"People who make games are optimists," Roberts admits.
"If you are building a two-bedroom house and suddenly change to building a castle it's going to be a different timeline."
But he also thinks this game is far from unique when it comes to delays.
"In the games business, games get cancelled all the time, games get pushed back and by the time you hear about the game it's probably been in development for years.
"Things always took longer than anyone thought."
He concedes that "there are always going to be some people that say, you told me it was going to be two years, I want it to be this big, I want it in two years."
"That isn't necessarily possible," he adds.
"Most of our customers aren't like that. They say: 'Take the time you need. If you need 10 years for a really great space game don't rush it out and make a bad one.'"
With the development studios spread out across the US and Europe, Roberts is often travelling between them all, checking the progress of the individual teams.
BBC Click visited the Los Angeles studio in California and the Wilmslow studio in the UK.
The atmosphere inside the studios was almost identical: dozens of artists and designers working on spaceship designs and character animations as well as painstakingly sifting though lines of code in search of bugs.
There was a sense of calm, but the size and complexity of the project is mind boggling to the outside observer.
There are almost 300 people working on this game and they are taking advantage of their different time zones.
The studio head in Los Angeles said that when a bug is found by his team, they can work on the problem and then, at the end of their day, hand it over to workers in the UK to crack, and vice-versa with bugs found at any of the other studios.
They call this "follow the sun" development. It means that work on Star Citizen is pretty much a 24-hour operation.
As well as the persistent universe there will also be a single player story-driven game called Squadron 42.
It sounds very much like Roberts is working in familiar Wing Commander territory here. In Squadron 42 the player assumes the role of a rookie pilot, embroiled in a war with a vicious alien species.
While the set-up is a little on the familiar side Roberts has assembled a star-studded cast for the game including Gary Oldman, Mark Strong and Gillian Anderson.
While the larger universe is still in development, Roberts says he aims to release Squadron 42 by the end of this year.
So, it looks like we are going to have to wait a little bit longer to play the full Star Citizen experience.

Article: The Harlequins centre will lead Wales in June Tests against Tonga and Samoa while the Lions take on New Zealand.
Roberts, 30, played for the Lions in 2009 and 2013 but was not selected this time by Warren Gatland.
"I was gutted for about a day or two and then you refocus and you go again and you use it as motivation," he said.
"You respond to it in one of two ways. You mope around and continue to mope around, or you dust yourself off and you go again.
"I've played some good rugby in the last few weeks for my club at Harlequins and I'm thoroughly looking forward to this tour.
"And I suppose being captain gives me extra incentive."
Roberts has started 83 of his 91 Tests for Wales but only one since they lost heavily to Australia in November.
"I was disappointed with the autumn series, in particular against Australia," said Roberts.
Roberts acknowledges he "deserved" to be dropped for his performance against the Wallabies.
"It was a bad day at the office and I paid the price for it," he said.
"Hopefully that's given me a kick up the backside to go again, and in the Six Nations it was disappointing not to get a shot at starting."
With 12 Wales players in the Lions squad, Roberts will lead a squad including 13 uncapped players.
It will be his first experience of captaining a side since he led Cardiff Schools Under-15s.
Wales' first Test is part of an Auckland double-header on Friday, 16 June, with their game against Tonga preceding New Zealand's match against Samoa.
A week later, Wales will be in Apia to take on Samoa.
Roberts said: "For me, the fundamental thing is having the time of your life and being accountable.
"I want the young lads to have the time of their lives playing for their country.

It was physical, it was abrasive, it was what they talked about all week and what new head coach Eddie Jones said he wanted to get England back to.
Jones said he was going up to Murrayfield to set the tone and leave with the win. He will go away happy and we will see a progression on what they did against Scotland over the next few games.
The tactics were more route one, using the forwards. Centre Jonathan Joseph didn't really get the ball and the wingers mainly got it from kick returns so there is still a bit of finesse for England to put around the back line.
The stats showed that England's set-piece was very good.
Captain Dylan Hartley's line-outs were brilliant (England only lost one of their 15) and they were clinical.
Jones has said he wants a strong set-piece game and he wants a strong, abrasive pack. They delivered that against Scotland.
England also probably had two clear-cut chances to score tries and they took both of them.
From that side it is all positives but I think Joseph will want to be in the game more.

His centre partner Owen Farrell wasn't in the game that much either and full-back Mike Brown wasn't his usual self. That will come but it is just going to take a bit of time.
I am not massively sold on the combination of Owen Farrell and George Ford at fly-half and inside centre. If you have two number 10s who are out-and-out number 10s then both of them are spending too much time organising the game rather than carrying the ball.
Farrell only carried the ball three times against Scotland and Joseph four. The midfield is not really functioning properly if that is happening. But at the same time, they linked up beautifully to put Jack Nowell in for a try.
I would prefer an out-and-out inside centre who can also be a ball player rather than a fly-half playing there. At the moment it is a stop gap for England.
I would prefer someone with a little bit more individual threat who can also do the distributing. Someone who is saying, "I need to be in the game more". Sometimes Farrell is trying to plan what England do and plot them around the pitch. George Ford needs to be doing that.
Henry Slade is your dream but he is injured. He would have been the answer without a question of a doubt. At the moment they are having to do what they can with limited resources.
England edged the breakdown in terms of numbers and in terms of actual turnovers.
There are a lot of people in the England pack that can make turnovers with Dan Cole, Chris Robshaw, Joe Launchbury, James Haskell, Billy Vunipola and Mako Vunipola off the bench.
I do hope England don't come up against an out-and-out specialist open-side flanker and get done again. We are not going to see that probably until we go to play Australia in the summer but it will be interesting to see what England do in the meantime.
We still need to develop an out-and-out number seven. It will strengthen our game but someone has got to play well enough to keep knocking on the door.
I judge intensity on the speed of your ball coming out from rucks and how fast people are getting into position to carry again.

England completely outworked Scotland in that respect. I also judge intensity on what a side does in defence - in terms of line speed in getting up to make a tackle.
In the first half England were a bit off it but in the second half they were outstanding. They really led the line and outworked Scotland. From that point of view I think Eddie will be very happy.
The scorelines might be similar between England's first game under Stuart Lancaster at Murrayfield in 2012 (a 13-6 victory) and this weekend but England had a lot more control this weekend.
At the same time it can't really be compared. Stuart was creating a brand new team. He got rid of all the old guys and brought in loads of youngsters. Jones' team knew each other very well.
I would give it a solid six and a half out of 10. Maybe a seven. There is still a lot of work to be done but knowing Jones and the workaholic nature he has got, he'll think the same.

Article: Federations must rule on whether Russians can compete in Rio following the country's doping scandal.
The Union Cycliste Internationale said three cyclists were withdrawn due to previous drugs cases, with another three implicated in the doping scandal.
Wrestler Viktor Lebedev, who returned a positive doping test at the 2006 Junior World Championships, was also banned.
Following a report conducted by Canadian law professor Richard McLaren, which said Russia operated a state-sponsored doping programme from 2011 to 2015, the International Olympic Committee ruled any Russian athlete who has served a doping ban will not be eligible for Rio 2016.
So far, more than 110 of the 387-strong Russian team have been banned from the Games, which get under way on 5 August.
The final line-up will be announced on 30-31 July, according to the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC).
Eleven of Russia's 17-strong cycling squad have been cleared to ride in Brazil.
United World Wrestling cleared 16 Russian wrestlers, while all four Russian badminton players have been told by the sport's governing body they can compete.
Badminton World Federation's Thomas Lund said the governing body was satisfied the athletes had been tested in and out of competition.
"We have had a rigid drug-testing programme, especially leading up to Rio 2016," he added. "Their samples have been analysed outside of Russia."
Boxing, golf, gymnastics, handball, taekwondo and weightlifting are still to confirm their eligibility decisions.
"We will tell how many people will go in the next few days," said Alexander Zhukov, the head of the ROC.
About 70 Russian athletes left Moscow for Brazil on Thursday, following a farewell ceremony hosted by Russian president Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin.
"They have got us fired up but in a good way," said handball player Polina Kuznetsova of the cheering crowd at Moscow's Sheremetevo airport.
"We are going to fight more to prove that it is difficult to break Russia. We will fight for those who were not able to go."
Olympic champion pole vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva and world champion hurdler Sergey Shubenkov are among 67 of the 68-strong athletics team to have been banned by the International Athletics Federation.
Isinbayeva corrected reports on Thursday suggesting she might be the Russian team's flag bearer in Rio, despite not being able to compete.
"We should clarify one very important thing!" she said via Instagram. "Flag bearer at the Olympics in Rio have already been defined, it is a great athlete, Olympic champion Sergey Tetyukhin (volleyball)."

Article: Researchers have found a 90% fall in levels of the human papilloma virus (HPV) in Scottish women since the vaccine was made available in 2008.
HPV virus types are thought to account for about 90% of cervical cancers.
Scientists hope the drop in HPV cases will lead to a significant drop in future cervical cancer cases.
The researchers, led by senior epidemiologist Dr Kevin Pollock at Health Protection Scotland, said they hoped to see a decrease in new diagnoses within a year.
He told BBC Radio Scotland: "The two HPV types we were vaccinating against - HPV 16 and HPV 18 - cause about 70% to 80% of cervical cancers within Scotland but the vaccine has exceeded our expectations because it appears to have knocked out another three high-risk HPV types which cause about 10% of cervical cancers.
"So we do forecast within the next few years a 90% reduction in cervical cancer within Scotland."
Researchers compared the cervical screening and vaccination records of women born in 1995, who had been vaccinated as teenagers, with those from unvaccinated women born between 1989 and 1990.
They found just 0.5% of women from the 1995 group tested positive for the virus, compared with 21.4% of women born before 1990.
The study also showed evidence that the vaccine protected against three other high-risk HPV genotypes involved in the development of cervical cancer.
The research will be presented to the Microbiology Society's annual conference in Edinburgh on Wednesday by Dr Kate Cuschieri, director of the Scottish HPV Reference Lab.
She said: "These new findings indicate that the positive impact of the HPV vaccine may be even greater than we initially thought.
"Collectively, these data demonstrate the significant and continued benefits of the HPV vaccination programme in Scotland, which has achieved a consistent and high uptake of around 90% in 12 to 13-year-old girls."
Dr Pollock added: "The very high uptake of the HPV vaccine is strongly associated with these massive reductions in high-risk HPV types that are known to cause approximately 90% of cervical cancer in Scottish women."
He said the virus was also known to cause a number of other cancers, including vulvovaginal, anal and a subset of head and neck cancers.
"These results suggest that this vaccine will also have a significant impact on these cancers in the years ahead", he said.
The research, which was funded by the Scottish government, looked at samples from more than 20,000 women, making it one of the largest population-based studies on the impact of the vaccine.
There were 388 new cases of cervical cancer in Scotland in 2014.

The 40-year-old won Olympic heptathlon bronze for Britain in 2004 and has been upgraded to two more bronze medals from 2008 after retrospective drug tests.
All world records set before 2005 could be rewritten under a new proposal from European Athletics, after the sport's latest doping scandal.
Sotherton said tweaking events would create "a new slate" and new records.
She said: "Could we go back to yards or run 101m instead of 100m?
"We all know that some of the records are completely out there. But not all of those records were achieved by people who cheated.
"Scrapping those records is unfair on those athletes. And what about my pre-2005 performances? Did they happen? Does this apply to national records too?"
Sotherton referred to the IAAF's decision to remodel the men's javelin in 1986.
Changes were made to the javelin's design because of increasingly frequent flat landings. All existing records were reset after the change, but not erased.
"I am open to the discussion - for the greater good of the sport it's a good thing," she added.

The central bank says that otherwise the country may struggle to honour its pension commitments.
It points out that the state pension system is in good financial health at present, but will come under pressure in coming decades.
The Bundesbank says that as baby-boomers - those born in the post-World War Two period - retire, there will be fewer younger workers to replace them.
The retirement age for Germans is set to rise gradually to 67 by 2030.
However, the bank believes that from 2050 this increase will not be enough for the German government to keep state pensions at their target level of at least 43% of the average income.
It is therefore proposing pushing the retirement age up to 69.
"Further changes are unavoidable to secure the financial sustainability (of the state pension system)," the Bundesbank said in its monthly report.
But German government spokesman Steffen Seibert said they stood by retirement at 67.
"Retirement at 67 is a sensible and necessary measure given the demographic development in Germany. That's why we will implement it as we agreed - step by step," he added.

Article: The world changed on 6 August 1945. Arguably, the appalling effects of that first atomic strike - and the subsequent attack on Nagasaki - have played a large part in the determination to prevent the use of far more devastating weapons developed since.
Back then, the US was the only nation with "the bomb".
The story since has been of the steady spread, the proliferation, of nuclear weapons: first to Russia, Britain, France and China - then to Israel (although never officially acknowledged), India, Pakistan, North Korea.
The big powers seemed either unable or unwilling to prevent that spread except perhaps now - in the case of Iran.
All sorts of conflicting signals are coming out of the international talks in Vienna meant to end all the hostility between the major world powers and Iran over its much disputed nuclear programme. There's talk of both breakdown and possible breakthrough.
So why is it judged so important to stop Iran?
I asked Sir John Sawers, chief British negotiator with Iran from 2003 to 2007, and after that the UK's representative on the UN Security Council when sanctions against Iran were being decided.
He said: "If Iran acquired a nuclear weapon, then it would change the dynamic across the Middle East.
"It would make them invulnerable to any response to their unacceptable behaviour in the region."
Sir John told me: "If there is an agreement then, first of all, it gives everyone much greater assurance that Iran is not going to make a break for nuclear weapons.
"It opens the possibility of Iran and its Arab neighbours coming together and developing a more normal relationship.
"At the moment, the Middle East is riven by disputes - many of them along Sunni-Shia lines - and if we can create a possibility whereby Saudis and Iranians can talk to one another and it is not driven by continuous hostility, then there is a possibility of creating a different sort of Middle East."
It's not just August 1945 which hangs heavy over the negotiations with Iran.
The events of February 1979 in Iran itself, and everything which has followed, help explain the years of suspicion and outright hostility between Tehran and Washington which a nuclear deal could do so much to ease.
Ayatollah Khomeini's triumphant return to Tehran - on 1 February 1979 - from exile in Paris to take power as supreme leader of an Islamic Republic symbolises the moment when the US and its allies lost control of Iran with the fall of the shah.
The years of blatant Western interference were over.
Ruhollah Khomeini was born in Kohmeyn in central Iran. He became a religious scholar and in the early 1920s rose to become an 'ayatollah', a term for a leading Shia scholar.
Arrested in 1962 by the shah's security service for his outspoken opposition to the pro-Western regime of the Shah. His arrest elevated him to the status of national hero.
Exiled in 1964, living in Turkey, Iraq and then France, from where he urged his supporters to overthrow the shah.
In January 1979, the shah's government collapsed and he and his family fled into exile. On 1 February, Khomeini returned to Iran in triumph.
There was a national referendum and Khomeini won a landslide victory. He declared an Islamic republic and was appointed Iran's political and religious leader for life.
Islamic law was introduced across the country.
The new religious leadership inherited a nuclear research programme, but consistently denies expanding it with the aim of making "the bomb".
The big powers have never accepted that, pointing instead to all the Iranian effort to produce highly-enriched uranium in the quantities you could only need to build a bomb, as well as the secrecy and alleged concealment of so much activity which is specifically outlawed by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to which Iran is a signatory.
Years of pressure applied by sanctions and negotiations to find a way forward have now reached a point where agreement could - just could - be possible.
I spoke to Ariane Tabatabai, of Georgetown University, who, like me, has been in Vienna to follow what is supposed to be the endgame in these talks.
She told me: "Ultimately, the negotiations are about making sure that Iran's nuclear programme remains peaceful and to do that it needs to provide a set of assurances and that would mean Iran scaling back some of its nuclear activities.
"It will also provide more transparency to the International Atomic Energy Agency to make sure that everything is essentially under constant monitoring, with enhanced access given to its facilities so the international community can verify that Iran is holding its end of the bargain."
Which brings us neatly to the unanswerable question: Is the Iranian leadership ready to make a bargain?
It could be, partly to pacify those Iranians fed up with sanctions which help cripple their economy and symbolise isolation from a fast-developing world they yearn to be part of.
Professor Ali Ansari, historian of Iran at St Andrews University, pointed me to another of the country's ambitions, which is to recover some of the global respect which Iran believes it is due.
"What the Iranians are after is a degree of respect as a country that considers itself a great power - certainly in the region - that has not had a good time in the last century or so.
"The real pride and achievement is that they have developed what they've considered to be an indigenous nuclear industry.
"One of the arguments many people have made is that an Islamic government wouldn't be scientifically advanced.
"Well for the Iranians, you know, this is, sort of proof that it actually can be, if they put their mind to it."
But Prof Ansari is far from certain that a deal can be done, and - even if it is - that it will hold.
And Sir John, from all his years negotiating with Iran, is blunt: "Whenever you buy a carpet in Iran, you have to buy it two, three times over.
"You sometimes feel that is the same in the nuclear negotiations as well. There is an Iranian saying that the real negotiation only begins once the agreement is signed.
"They will always come back for more. Even if we get an agreement - it doesn't mean it is 'peace in our time'."
So suspicion on both sides remains strong.
Whatever happens in the next few days, building and then maintaining trust between Iran and the key world powers, particularly the US, is still the toughest of all the challenges.

Article: Mr Drumm, who resigned in December 2008 as the bank was collapsing, was brought before Dublin District Court on Monday to be charged with 33 offences.
They include false accounting linked to transactions worth 7bn euros (£5.4bn).
He was arrested in the early hours of Monday after arriving at Dublin Airport on an overnight flight from Boston.
Gardaí (Irish police) accompanied the former chief executive on the transatlantic flight and shortly after landing he was brought to a Dublin police station, and then escorted to the court.
The hearing was told that Mr Drumm made no reply when police officers put the charges to him at the station.
Sixteen of the charges relate to the alleged provision of unlawful financial assistance to 16 wealthy investors, in a bid to prop up Anglo's share price before the collapse.
Mr Drumm moved to the US in 2009, the same year Anglo Irish Bank had to be bailed out by Irish taxpayers.
Police objected to his bail application, claiming the accused is a potential flight risk.
A sergeant told the court police believed Mr Drumm had the capacity to flee the jurisdiction and seemed to have access to large sums of money when required, despite owing millions in debts.
A prosecution lawyer told the court the accused had fought tooth and nail against his extradition from Boston and had been leading the authorities a "merry dance" during the process.
However, Mr Drumm's solicitor said his client had offered to surrender his passport, be tagged and sign on twice daily at his local police station.
The defence lawyer added that the accused had offered to provide a "relatively large" amount of cash and had several family members who were willing to "put their houses on the line" so he could be granted bail.
The judge granted bail on Mr Drumm's own bond of 50,000 euros (£39,000) and two independent sureties of 50,000 euros.
Mr Drumm ran Anglo Irish Bank from 2005 to 2008 and subsequently filed for bankruptcy in the US.
However, the bankruptcy bid failed and a Boston court ruled that he could be held liable for debts of 10.5m euros (£8.34m).
It was alleged during the bankruptcy case that the 48-year-old former bank boss secretly transferred money and assets to his wife, so they could not be seized during bankruptcy proceedings.
Authorities in the Republic of Ireland issued an extradition request last year and he was arrested at his American home in October.
At a hearing in Boston last month, Mr Drumm agreed to return to the Republic of Ireland as soon as possible.
Bailing out the bank cost Irish taxpayers about 30bn euros (£22bn: $34bn), close to one-fifth of annual output.
Its downfall played a large role in the collapse of the Irish economy in 2008 and the ensuing bailout from its eurozone partners two years later.

Article: Something Wicked this Way Comes, shown on a Sunday morning, featured the illusionist putting a plastic bag over his head and walking on broken glass.
Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom said children could have imitated Brown's "clearly dangerous behaviour".
It received five complaints about the show, which aired on UKTV's Watch channel on 6 December.
UKTV said the programme was broadcast in error and was unsuitable for a pre-watershed transmission.
In the 14-minute segment, Brown had sought to demonstrate a technique to limit pain and bleeding.   He placed a transparent bag over his head and sealed it while a member of the audience tapped out his pulse rate on a drum.
Once his pulse rate had slowed to a stop, Brown - who appeared to be in a state of semi-consciousness - removed the bag from his head and walked barefoot on a path of broken glass.
At the end of the sequence, the camera zoomed on his feet to show that they had not bled as a result of contact with the glass.
Ofcom said: "Plastic bags are a common household item that children frequently have access to without parental supervision. They also present a widely acknowledged risk of harm to young children.
"Therefore, Ofcom took the view that Derren Brown's use of a plastic bag to asphyxiate himself was likely to be easily imitable by children in a manner that was harmful.
"This was particularly because self-asphyxiation was presented as a way to carry out acts which would not normally be possible because of the bleeding and pain that resulted.
"Further in this programme no negative consequences of self-asphyxiation were identified."
Ofcom also found that Brown's use of swear words during the segment breached the code on offensive language before the watershed.
UKTV said an internal investigation had revealed that "due to human error" the programme was "erroneously labelled" as being suitable for broadcast before the watershed.
It said it had implemented additional safeguards to prevent the same mistake happening again.

A programme in which illusionist Derren Brown suffocated himself as part of a trick has broken broadcasting rules.

She comes from a musical family of 15 children, and in this performance for the BBC's Africa Beats series, she is supported by her brothers, Pata and Dozzy Njava, and her cousin Christian Ravalison, all of whom are respected musicians in Belgium, where they now live.
Lala Njava is passionately concerned by the issues her native land faces, especially deforestation, and is donating a portion of the revenues from her CD sales to a tree planting project.

Article: Mr Johnson highlighted growing concerns among students about not getting good value for money.
He also warned universities to stop "excessive" pay for vice-chancellors.
But Mr Johnson rejected calls to scrap tuition fees - saying it would be a "disaster of historic proportions".
The Russell Group of leading universities was lukewarm in its response to the idea of a binding contract - warning of "unintended consequences" and saying that "no one would want to see standards undermined by the risk of legal action".
Labour said that talk about value for money for students was a "smokescreen" to cover for the unpopularity of the rising cost of fees.
In a speech to the Reform think tank in London, Mr Johnson fought back against calls to stop the rise in tuition fees and interest rates on loans.
The Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned that higher fees of £9,250 and interest rates rising to 6.1% will mean graduates leaving university with debts of more than £50,000 on average.
Former Education Minister Lord Adonis has called such high levels of fees and interest charges "indefensible", and the head of the Russell Group of universities has called for a reassessment of interest rates.
But Mr Johnson, while saying such charges would be kept "under review", he defended the principles underlying the current system as progressive and providing the funding for extra university places.
Mr Johnson said it was "outrageous" and "entirely false" to suggest that higher tuition fees had deterred disadvantaged students from going to university - and that entry rates for young people from poorer backgrounds were at record levels.
Labour's policy of scrapping tuition fees would mean universities depending on government funding, said Mr Johnson, and he said that if higher education was competing against other pressures on public spending, universities would see their budgets squeezed.
It would mean a "long decline into mediocrity", said Mr Johnson, and a falling number of places.
He said the cost of scrapping fees, clearing existing student-loan debts and repaying students who had already paid off their loans would require a 2.5p hike in the basic rate of income tax.
But he also called for the university system to become much more responsive to the needs of students.
Mr Johnson said the newly established Office for Students would consider how to introduce contracts for all students, giving them a way of contesting the quality of their courses.
This would cover areas such as contact time, resources and assessments.
"Although contracts do exist in various forms in some institutions, most of them do not provide enough detail to be useful," said Mr Johnson.
"Providing students with greater contractual certainty", said Mr Johnson, would "help to address much of the dissatisfaction over seeming poor value-for-money of undergraduate education".
Mr Johnson said such contracts would tackle problems of "non-delivery" for students and would give them "some form of redress", which could include "legal remedies".
The minister also told universities to restrain pay for vice-chancellors - with dozens of university heads now receiving over £300,000 and some being paid more than £400,000.
"When students and taxpayers invest so heavily in our higher education system, value for money should be guaranteed.  Yet, I am still hearing students say that their course is poor quality.
"This is not good enough, especially when some vice-chancellors take home a wage that in some cases exceeds that of the prime minister."
But Labour's universities spokesman, Gordon Marsden, said Mr Johnson was "completely toothless" over vice-chancellors' pay and his complaints would be "kicked into the long grass".
"His announcements today are a smokescreen to dodge mounting evidence that the cost of loans is pushing students away from applying to university and forcing more to drop out," said Mr Marsden.

Students will have formal contracts with universities, so they can challenge them over too few teaching hours or if facilities are inadequate, says Universities Minister Jo Johnson.

Article: This country's dramatic political changes have passed them by. Greater democracy has not brought greater respect for the stateless Rohingya's human rights.
But the formation of an Advisory Commission on Rakhine State represents a rare glimmer of hope.
For the first time, the Burmese government is seeking international expertise to try and solve one of the country's most complex problems.
It's a significant shift. For years, the official Burmese mantra has been that "no foreigner can possibly understand Rakhine's problems".
Now Kofi Annan, the former UN secretary general, has been tasked with taking a fresh look at the issues as head of nine-member commission. His report could just add to the mountain of papers written about Rakhine and the Rohingya, or it just might be a game-changer.
Will anyone help the Rohingya?
Rohingya migrant crisis in 90 seconds
The 'abandoned' people in Myanmar's election
Aung San Suu Kyi where are you?
So what's Aung San Suu Kyi up to?
Well, first a cynical take. Next week the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon is due in the Burmese capital Nay Pyi Taw and in September Ms Suu Kyi will head to the United States for the UN General Assembly and talks with President Obama.
The Nobel laureate was no doubt bracing herself for awkward questions about why she wasn't doing more to help Myanmar's Muslim minority and in particular the 800,000 or so Rohingya. Those questions can now be easily deflected with reference to this new commission.
But there's more at play than that. By setting up the commission, Ms Suu Kyi is signalling that she is open to new ideas, and doesn't have all the answers.
Kofi Annan may be 78 but, as you'd expect from a former UN secretary general, he's his own man.
The final report, due to be delivered by the end of August 2017, is likely to contain suggestions that many Burmese consider unpalatable.
Almost certainly it will insist that the Rohingya's basic human rights are respected, perhaps recommending that Myanmar offer them a better route to citizenship.
In Myanmar's current political climate it's hard for Ms Suu Kyi to bring those ideas to the table. She'd be attacked not just by hardline Buddhists but many within her own party.
So Kofi Annan and his report could be the "Trojan Horse" that brings this sort of proposal into the national debate.
There are of course plenty of caveats.
Problems as deeply entrenched as those between the Buddhist and Muslim communities in Rakhine State will not be solved overnight. The animosity between them has built up over decades with many in the Buddhist majority seeing the Rohingya as illegal immigrants from across the border in Bangladesh.
After the violence of 2012, more than 100,000 Rohingya were forced from their homes into camps. In the years that have followed there's been no real effort to help them return.
Rakhine has become increasingly segregated, with some comparing it to South Africa's apartheid. Things have become quieter but there's been little reconciliation.
Whatever the commission ends up concluding, any move to give the Rohingya greater rights will be hugely controversial not just in Rakhine State but across the country.
Vocal parts of the Buddhist community are openly hostile towards international aid agencies and the UN. They're unlikely to welcome Kofi Annan's team, no doubt anticipating the sort of recommendations he might make.
Implementing any "solution" will be even harder.
But the formation of this advisory commission is something new. However small, it's the first bit of positive news that the Rohingya have had for a long time.

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence. The Myanmar government has formed an Advisory Commission on Rakhine State, headed by former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, to address the complex issues surrounding the stateless Rohingya minority, which has been denied basic human rights and faced violence and

Article: He said such a series "would show what a great service the programme is performing for young entrepreneurs, young people, to inspire them".
The BBC said there are no current plans to broadcast a spin-off series.
Speaking about some of the show's past winners, Lord Sugar said: "They've turned into great business people."
He added: "I think the BBC need to do something about that. They need to do a programme, for example, on where they are now."
Earlier this year, BBC Two broadcast a spin-off programme from Dragons' Den, Pitches to Riches, which charted the trajectory of several business ideas the so-called Dragons had invested in.
Lord Sugar added that the success of previous Apprentice winners was "what motivates me to carry on doing [the show]".
"They're doing very well, and they don't get enough publicity. The BBC doesn't get enough publicity over the purpose of this programme.
"I enjoy watching these young people grow a business from scratch really, and that's why I get a great buzz out of it."
"Ricky Martin [2012 series winner] has got about 25 people working for him, Tom [Pellereau, 2011 winner] has eight or nine working for him, Leah [Totton, 2013 winner] has got two clinics now."
He added: "They are one of the reasons why the candidates flock to the auditions because they want to be them."
Not every previous contestant on the show has gone on to success in the business world, however.
One of the most high-profile former candidates is Katie Hopkins - who is now a newspaper columnist and radio presenter, well-known for her controversial opinions
"You get a few people that are picked up by the media because of their outlandish comments, and they go and pursue a separate career," Lord Sugar said.
"Lots of them have tried. Katie Hopkins has found herself a special niche in the market. She's a bit like Piers Morgan on steroids, and of course the media lap it up. And the more controversial she wants to be, the more they lap it up."
Claude Littner and Karren Brady have returned to assist Lord Sugar on the new series of The Apprentice, which begins on 6 October on BBC One.
The businessman said the show's tasks had been updated for 2016.
"One of the things I love about this process is, as I'm getting older, I've got a great production team that keep me on my toes as far as technology is concerned.
"With a lot of the tasks some of the stuff we're going to be doing didn't exist 12 years ago. For example, there's a virtual reality episode in there."
Lord Sugar said he believes "the freshness of the contestants" keeps the show relevant, adding: "One of them was 11 years old when The Apprentice first started and has watched it since then and here they are, turning up to be one of the contestants in the show."
"We have a new audience growing every year, and that's the excitement of the programme."
Lord Sugar was speaking hours after Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump took part in a televised debate with the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
From 2004 until last year, Trump appeared as the figurehead of the US version of The Apprentice - the position Lord Sugar holds on the UK show.
Asked for his thoughts on his former US counterpart, Lord Sugar said: "Well he's not as good as me, as far as The Apprentice is concerned. He's not in my class, quite frankly.
"I saw the debate with him and Hillary Clinton and what comes to mind is that it's like a US version of Would I Lie To You?
"As many people have said it is quite a frightening thought that he may be the most powerful man in the world shortly."
Karren Brady added: "For me personally, I think Hillary Clinton, another woman leader across the world, means the world is a safer and better place."
Lord Sugar also did not shy away from talking about UK politics, commenting that the outcome of the EU Referendum in June made him "fear for our country".
Referring to the vote to leave the EU, Lord Sugar said: "I was very clear in my views, I think they've made a fatal mistake."
"Lots of people are saying nothing has changed. Well, exactly. Nothing has changed because we haven't even started [the process of leaving] yet."
Lord Sugar, previously known as Sir Alan Sugar, became a peer in 2009, while Karren Brady became Baroness Brady in 2014.
So would Claude Littner like to be in line for a knighthood of his own in the future?
"To be honest it crosses my mind all the time," he joked, "but no-one has actually made me the offer".

Article: I think I've only ever had one or two hugs from Ivan - once after I lost my first Wimbledon final against Roger Federer, and maybe also when I won the US Open final. I don't think there was any hugging when I won Wimbledon.
So it was with a straight handshake that we greeted each other at Queen's Club on Tuesday morning -  the first time we'd seen each other since the US Open last September.
Media playback is not supported on this device
We'd chatted occasionally over the past couple of years and I'd spoken to him a few times at the end of last year.
I was just staying in contact, seeing what he was up to, and I knew he'd done some trials with other players so was interested to know if he was considering getting back on the tour.
We know each other very well and it was good to have him back on Tuesday, it didn't feel strange at all. Getting a win over someone as good on grass as Nicolas Mahut was certainly a great start.
Ivan is very clear and has strong opinions on things.
That's important, I like that. I'd rather someone was very strong with what they're saying and, if I disagree, that's not a problem for him. He doesn't take it to heart.
It's a bit easier to communicate when you don't feel like you're going to upset someone.
I also enjoy his company and his sense of humour. He'll chat about pretty much anything. He's into his sports and has lots of good stories from when he was on tour.
It was a bit different back then with Johnny Mac [McEnroe] and Jimmy Connors around. There weren't microphones and cameras everywhere. I'd say it was little bit more interesting in some ways.
Obviously there are rivalries on the tour now but, from the stories that I've heard, I'd say the players today are a lot more friendly with each other off the court.
It's important that Ivan and my other coach, Jamie Delgado, spend time together over the next few days.
Ivan has arrived with his own clear ideas on what he thinks I need to be doing but one of his great strengths is he's a very good team player. It's crucial that he and Jamie see eye to eye.
Ultimately I spend 40 weeks of the year with Jamie, and he also needs to believe and buy into the stuff that I'm working on as well.
Jamie knows me well too, he's spent pretty much every day with me for the last three or four months, and that can help Ivan.
So the two of them will chat about the things we need to concentrate on, especially this week on the grass. I'll be told before practice that this is what we're doing, I'll give a bit of feedback about what I might want to focus on, and we'll start work.
I'm the number two player in the world by a decent distance in terms of ranking points, so I'm not playing badly, but the goals remain the same as ever.
There are still things I feel I can improve upon, which I need to do if I want to get to number one in the world and try and win majors.
I believe that Ivan, along with the other guys I'm working with, can help me achieve that.
I think my team is very strong right now. I've been getting better over the past few months, I've improved some things, and hopefully I can get a few percent better over the next few months.
Winning a fifth title at Queen's Club this week would be the perfect start.

Article: Ri Jong Chol said his detention was a "plot" to "damage the honour of the republic", Reuters news agency reports.
He made the comments outside the North Korea embassy in Beijing after he was deported from Malaysia on Friday.
Ri Jong Chol was released from police custody due to insufficient evidence.
Speaking to reporters early on Saturday, he accused Malaysia of using coercion in an attempt to extract a confession.
Malaysian authorities are continuing their investigation into the death of Mr Kim, the estranged half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who was killed at an airport in the country's capital, Kuala Lumpur nearly three weeks ago.
Ri Jong Chol, who said he was not at the airport on the day of the incident, was the only North Korean held in connection with the death.
Malaysia is seeking to question several North Koreans, including an embassy official.
Two women, Doan Thi Huong from Vietnam and Siti Aisyah from Indonesia, were charged on Thursday with killing Mr Kim by smearing his face with VX, a banned chemical weapon.
Both women said they thought they were taking part in a TV prank. They have yet to make a formal plea in their case.
Malaysia, which has condemned the use of the powerful nerve agent in the 13 February attack, is also investigating a firm thought to be used by North Korea to evade sanctions on military exports.
Ri Jong Chol had lived in Malaysia for three years but, according to Reuters, his work permit expired on 6 February.
Immigration director-general Mustafar Ali said Ri Jong Chol, who was escorted out of Malaysia by two North Korean embassy officials, was blacklisted from re-entering the country.
Meanwhile, the government said it had launched an investigation into a company called Glocom, which has been operating in Malaysia for several years.
According to a confidential United Nations report, Glocom is run by North Korea's top intelligence agency to sell military communications equipment, in violation of UN sanctions.
Police said on Friday that an arrest warrant had been issued for 37-year-old Kim Uk-il, who works for North Korean national airline Air Koryo. He is believed to be still in Malaysia.
Reuters news agency reported that security checks on North Koreans had been stepped up at all border crossings to prevent them from leaving.
On Thursday, Malaysia announced it was cancelling visa-free travel for visiting North Koreans, citing security reasons.
It has not directly blamed North Korea for the attack, but there is widespread suspicion Pyongyang was responsible.
North Korea has strongly rejected the allegations. It also rejected the findings of the post-mortem examination, having objected to it being carried out at all, and has demanded the body be handed over to them.
It has not yet confirmed that the body is that of Kim Jong-nam, acknowledging him only as a North Korean citizen. Mr Kim was travelling using a passport under a different name.

The North Korean suspect questioned in connection with the death of Kim Jong-nam has said he was the victim of a conspiracy by the Malaysian authorities.

Article: According to organisers a record 3.6 million turned out to vote in the Scottish independence referendum.
More than 100,000 of the total were 16 to 17-year-olds who had registered to vote.
Erin Fyfe McWilliam, 16 said: "I'm glad the government thought we were able to make decisions for our country."
She thinks it's put young people in the spotlight: "Usually the older generation see us as being the 'tallywags' who don't care about politics at all.
"But I do think this referendum has taught the younger generation a lot about politics."
A survey, commissioned by Conservative peer Lord Ashcroft, said 71% of 16 to 17-year-olds voted for Scotland to be independent and 29% voted against.
So even if the age-group contributed their political views, it didn't appear to influence the outcome.
Scotland remains part of the United Kingdom after the "No" campaign won.
The Scottish referendum was a one-off for 16 and 17-year-olds, after the Scottish Parliament passed legislation allowing it to happen.
But for years youth campaign groups have been trying to get the UK voting age lowered, arguing you can get married at 16 and pay your taxes, so why not vote?
Gaelan Miller 17, who voted in the referendum, agreed that he didn't have that much life experience but said that shouldn't matter.
"Sometimes I think young folk like me can be influenced by your parents and we don't have mortgages," he said.
"But that's not to say we can't look at statistics at what's happened before with mortgages and ask your parents questions."
The Lib Dems are all for 16 and 17-year-olds voting and promised it in their 2010 manifesto.
Labour leader, Ed Miliband, also backs lowering the age.
UKIP are against it, the Green Party is for and the Scottish National Party (SNP) is in favour as well.
David Cameron and the Tories oppose it, so until all the parties agree to debate the issue it's unlikely to happen.
Senior Lib Dem minister and Scottish MP, Danny Alexander, told Newsbeat he believes young people "bring a freshness to the debate and ask important questions".
He said: "I've always believed that 16 to 17-year-olds should have the vote.
"Some of the best debates and discussion I have had about the Scottish referendum have been with young people in schools and Newsbeat's Big Debate."
But when asked about lowering the voting age before the next General election in May 2015, he was less optimistic.
"Not every party wants that so that we will have to look at that. We need to build a consensus across all parties for that happen. So we could have debate the constitutional changes in the UK," the chief of the Treasury said.
"All parties have to agree to do that. But I think the time has come for reform."
17-year-old Erin added: "It's a bit disappointing being given this opportunity, then being told a few months down the line you have to wait a few years. I think it should be changed so that 16 and 17 year olds can vote."
In the last general election in 2010, fewer than half of all 18 to 24-year-olds voted, which was much lower than the national average.

Article: Reverend Irene Wilson was leaving Holy Trinity Church in Hull at 13:30 BST on 7 August when her vehicle was targeted.
Jay Desborough, 17, and Leon Wrigglesworth, 13, both from the city, were each given a 24-month detention and training order in a young offenders institute at the city's youth court.
Rev Wilson said it had "affected myself and the work that I do".
The pair had only known each other for a week before carrying out the carjacking, the court heard.
As well as having her car stolen, Rev Wilson's handbag containing Â£250 in cash and a laptop computer were also taken.
In court, the vicar described how her daughter, who she was speaking to on the phone at the time of the attack, was "still traumatised from hearing my screams".
Robin Smith, the solicitor defending Desborough, told the court the teenager had asked a family member to send an apology letter and a bouquet of flowers to the vicar as an apology.
But Rev Wilson, who was in court, confirmed it had not happened.
The vicar said she had "at all times tried to understand the culprits" and asked people to "pray for the two young men, that they will make a positive decision".
Sally Robinson, the Crown Prosecution Service's reviewing lawyer, said: "This was a shocking attack carried out in broad daylight on a respected community figure.
"Our thoughts remain with Rev Wilson as she continues to recover from the effects of this crime."
Chairman of the bench Vincent Bergin lifted a ban on naming the teenagers.
Desborough, who was aged 16 at the time of the attack, admitted to one charge of robbery at a previous hearing.
Wrigglesworth denied robbery but was found guilty following a trial.
He was also convicted of 15 other offences.

Now, he has to find a replacement for the German as team-mate to Lewis Hamilton. And at this late stage of the year, it will be no easy task.
So who will be on Wolff's shortlist and how likely are they to get the seat?
This is the fight many would like to see. Hamilton and Alonso are regarded as the two towering talents of their generation and their intense battle as McLaren team-mates in 2007 was cut short by Alonso falling out with boss Ron Dennis and leaving the team. They ended that year tied on points, one behind world champion Kimi Raikkonen, with four wins each.
Round two would be the biggest box office F1 could hope for, but it is highly unlikely to happen for two reasons: 1) Alonso is under contract to McLaren and even if he has a break clause - which they say he does not - they would not want to let him go; 2) More importantly, Wolff knows that the problems he had with Hamilton and Rosberg would pale compared to the potential difficulties of handling Hamilton and Alonso.
Chances of it happening: 6/10
The Australian was the choice of many observers as the driver of 2016, and Wolff is a big fan. The on-track battle with Hamilton would be intense, but Ricciardo is a laid-back character and would probably be easier to handle off it.
But he is under contract to Red Bull until 2018. Red Bull says they have no intention of letting him go, but if Wolff approached them there is just the possibility that they may consider selling Ricciardo. Why? Because most accept that, long term, Ricciardo and Max Verstappen is not a sustainable line-up - if Red Bull become title contenders their relationship is very likely to become incendiary.
Chances: 6/10
Verstappen is the big rising star of F1. Shaded by Ricciardo over 2016 as a whole, performances such as his stunning drive in the wet in Brazil last month mark him out as a future world champion.
Wolff would be very interested but, like Ricciardo, Verstappen is under contract to Red Bull - in his case to the end of 2019. And Red Bull are even more in love with the Dutchman than they are with Ricciardo.
Chances: 4/10
Vettel's love affair with Ferrari - and vice versa - is long over after a difficult and disappointing season. Relations with team boss Maurizio Arrivabene are frayed - especially since the Italian said the four-time champion should focus more on his driving and needed to "earn" a new contract beyond 2017. And Vettel was unhappy with the decision to split with technical director James Allison in the summer.
Likewise, Ferrari have been confused how, after a year and a half of easily beating team-mate Kimi Raikkonen, Vettel's form slipped in the second half of 2016 - although they might want to read the previous paragraph for an answer.
Vettel has been shopping around for a move and would almost certainly welcome a switch to Mercedes. But there are some problems: 1) his contract runs to the end of 2017 and there is no obvious replacement for Ferrari; 2) he might not fancy going up against Hamilton; 3) Vettel and Hamilton together is almost as much of a recipe for trouble as Hamilton and Alonso.
Chances of it happening: 8/10
Wolff has a long relationship with Bottas as part of his management team and rates him highly. The Finn has impressed in the last four seasons with Williams and would be a low-maintenance choice. He would deliver solid results on track and is calm and would not rock the boat off it.
Next year is the last year of his contract at Williams. The team is not the most flush with cash in the pit lane and Wolff would almost certainly be able to put together an attractive deal - either for a cash payment to release Bottas or a reduction in Williams' engine fee.
But Williams have an 18-year-old rookie in the well-resourced Canadian Lance Stroll in their other car next year and need experience in the lead car. Wolff could offer them Mercedes protege Pascal Wehrlein, who raced for Manor in 2016, in exchange. But would Williams accept? Felipe Nasr, who raced for Sauber in 2016, would also be an option for them, and please F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone, who needs a Brazilian in the sport to satisfy its largest single TV audience.
Chances: 9/10
The German is the obvious choice - he is Mercedes' reserve driver, he has tested for the team several times, and he is a free agent. But he has only one season's race experience, and although he has put in some promising drives, he has had a few shaky ones as well.
Putting him in a race-winning car with Hamilton as his team-mate would be a big ask. And that's without even considering his personality. Insiders say Wehrlein can be difficult and self-centred, and Wolff will be wary of putting such a character alongside Hamilton.
Chances: 8/10
Another Mercedes young driver, Ocon has impressed in his half-season alongside Wehrlein at Manor - so much so that Force India picked him rather than the German as their second driver alongside Sergio Perez for 2017.
But Ocon has only nine races under his belt and it's surely too early for him to get a seat at the factory Mercedes team.
Chances: 7/10
A left-field choice, the Scot has been out of F1 for two years now. But he was Williams reserve driver this year and is a Mercedes-contracted driver in the DTM German Touring Car Championship and would be a solid option.
Chances: 5/10
Button has retired from F1, but remains contracted to McLaren. He made it very clear in the last few weeks that he needed a break from the sport.
Chances: 1/10
The German has just signed a three-year deal with Renault, but the French company and Mercedes have links on a corporate level and Wolff is close friends with their racing boss Frederic Vasseur.
But taking Hulkenberg would leave Renault with a vacancy that would be tough to fill and Wolff is not overly enamoured with him either.

Article: The team at King's College London say smokers are more likely to develop the disorder and at a younger age.
Published in the Lancet Psychiatry, their analysis of 61 separate studies suggests nicotine in cigarette smoke may be altering the brain.
Experts said it was a "pretty strong case" but needed more research.
Smoking has long been associated with psychosis, but it has often been believed that schizophrenia patients are more likely to smoke because they use cigarettes as a form of self-medication to ease the distress of hearing voices or having hallucinations.
The team at King's looked at data involving 14,555 smokers and 273,162 non-smokers.
It indicated:
The argument is that if there is a higher rate of smoking before schizophrenia is diagnosed, then smoking is not simply a case of self-medication.
Dr James MacCabe, from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King's, said: "It's very difficult to establish causation [with this style of study], what we're hoping that this does is really open our eyes to the possibility that tobacco could be a causative agent in psychosis, and we hope this will then lead to other research and clinical trials that would help to provide firmer evidence."
Clearly most smokers do not develop schizophrenia, but the researchers believe it is increasing the risk.
The overall incidence of the condition is one in every 100 people normally, which may be increased to two per 100 by smoking.
The researchers said nicotine altered levels of the brain chemical dopamine, which has already been implicated in the psychosis.
Prof Michael Owen, the director of the Institute of Psychological Medicine at Cardiff University, said the researchers had made a "pretty strong case" that smoking may increase the risk of schizophrenia.
"The fact is that it is very hard to prove causation without a randomised trial, but there are plenty of good reasons already for targeting public health measures very energetically at the mentally ill."
The charity Rethink Mental Illness said: "We know that 42% of all cigarettes smoked in England are by people with mental health problems, and so any new findings about the link between smoking and psychosis is a potential worry.
"However, longer-term studies are needed to fully understand this potential link."

Article: Accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) said security has been beefed up at the residences of Brian Cullinan and Martha Ruiz following the mistake.
Celebrity website TMZ.com said the pair were in fear of their lives.
On Wednesday it emerged they will not be employed to do the Oscars job again.
But TMZ.com reported that they will not lose their accountancy jobs.
PwC spokeswoman Carey Bodenheimer said that they had been given protection after their home addresses and photos of their families were published in the media.

How did the Oscars mistake happen?
Nine epic awards fails
On Sunday La La Land was mistakenly named best picture instead of winner Moonlight.
The team behind La La Land were interrupted mid-acceptance speech before the real winner was revealed.
It has been described as the biggest mistake in 89 years of Academy Awards history.
Mr Cullinan mistakenly handed the wrong envelope to the two presenters, Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway.
They were given the back-up envelope for best actress in a leading role - rather than the envelope which contained the name of the winner for the best film.
PwC counts the votes and organises the envelopes. It has apologised for the mix-up.
Academy President Cheryl Boone Isaacs on Wednesday said that the relationship with PwC was now under review.
Mr Cullinan tweeted a picture of best actress winner Emma Stone minutes before handing the presenters the wrong envelope, and Ms Boone Isaacs blamed "distraction" for the error.

Article: Lord Carey writes in the Daily Mail that he has dropped his opposition to the Assisted Dying Bill "in the face of the reality of needless suffering".
But the current Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has called the bill "mistaken and dangerous".
Peers will debate the bill on Friday.
Tabled by Labour peer Lord Falconer, the legislation would make it legal for adults in England and Wales to be given assistance ending their own life. It would apply to those with less than six months to live.
Two doctors would have to independently confirm the patient was terminally ill and had reached their own, informed decision to die.
Some 110 peers are already listed to speak when the House of Lords debates the private members bill on Friday.
Insisting it would not be "anti-Christian" to change the law, Lord Carey said the current situation risked "undermining the principle of human concern which should lie at the heart of our society".
He added: "Today we face a central paradox. In strictly observing the sanctity of life, the Church could now actually be promoting anguish and pain, the very opposite of a Christian message of hope."
When Lord Carey was still the Archbishop of Canterbury he was among the opponents of Lord Joffe's Assisting Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill, which was successfully blocked in the House of Lords in 2006.
But in his article in Saturday's Daily Mail Lord Carey said: "The fact is that I have changed my mind. The old philosophical certainties have collapsed in the face of the reality of needless suffering."
He said it was the case of Tony Nicklinson, who had locked-in syndrome and died after being refused the legal right to die, who had had the "deepest influence" on his decision.
Mr Nicklinson's widow Jane, said Lord Carey's switch was "huge".
"I'm amazed actually and thrilled because the Church has always been one of our greatest opponents," she told BBC Radio 5 live.
"Someone shouldn't be forced to stay alive with daily suffering - his life was a living hell."
There's been something of a shocked reaction to what Lord Carey said. Let's remember he's a former archbishop. He still has some influence in the Church, especially among the more traditionalist minded Anglicans.
So what he said really will have some consequences. He'll also have some influence presumably in the House of Lords, having argued in the past strongly against similar legislation.
One of the most telling things about what Lord Carey has said is that he now thinks it's not "un-Christian" to allow people to take their own lives when they're suffering at the end of their lives.
It speaks to a body of people, including in the Anglican church, who now feel they can to some extent re-interpret what it is to be Christian, to be Anglican and how to put that into practice in their everyday lives.
To hear that coming from a stalwart defender of biblical truth like Lord Carey is pretty significant.
Lord Falconer told BBC Radio 5 live that Lord Carey "makes the point that it's not anti-Christian to support the change in the law that my bill proposes".
"I believe it reflects the view of almost everyone in the debate that - whatever view you take about the issues - nobody wants people who are properly motivated by compassion to be prosecuted. And he puts those arguments incredibly powerfully."
However, the current Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby warned Lord Falconer's bill would mean elderly and disabled people coming under pressure to end their lives.
"What sort of society would we be creating if we were to allow this sword of Damocles to hang over the head of every vulnerable, terminally-ill person in the country?" he wrote in the Times.
"It would be very naive to think that many of the elderly people who are abused and neglected each year, as well as many severely disabled individuals, would not be put under pressure to end their lives if assisted suicide were permitted by law.
"It would be equally naive to believe, as the Assisted Dying Bill suggests, that such pressure could be recognised in every instance by doctors given the task of assessing requests for assisted suicide.
"Abuse, coercion and intimidation can be slow instruments in the hands of the unscrupulous, creating pressure on vulnerable people who are encouraged to 'do the decent thing'."
The 1961 Suicide Act makes it an offence to encourage or assist a suicide or a suicide attempt in England and Wales. Anyone doing so could face up to 14 years in prison.
The law is almost identical in Northern Ireland. There is no specific law on assisted suicide in Scotland, creating some uncertainty, although in theory someone could be prosecuted under homicide legislation.
There have already been several attempts to legalise assisted dying, but these have been rejected.
The Commission on Assisted Dying, established and funded by campaigners who have been calling for a change in the law, concluded in 2012 that there was a "strong case" for allowing assisted suicide for people who are terminally ill in England and Wales.
But the medical profession and disability rights groups, among others, argue that the law should not be changed because it is there to protect the vulnerable in society.
In other countries, such as Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, legislation has been introduced to allow assisted dying. France is considering a possible introduction of similar legislation, although there is opposition from its medical ethics council.
Campaign group Dignity in Dying predicts that a lot more countries will follow suit.
The Bishop of Carlisle, the Right Reverend James Newcome, said Lord Carey's comments would not influence any vote by bishops in the House of Lords.
"The general synod has debated it and come to a conclusion. That's the position to which we're sticking."
But Lord Carey did received support from Rabbi Jonathan Romain, an inter-faith leader for campaign group Dignity in Dying.
He said the experience in the US state of Oregon - where assisted dying became legal in 1997 - showed "very few people" would use the right to get help to end their lives.
The Church of England said in a statement that its governing body, the General Synod, had passed a motion on the issue in February 2012.
The motion reaffirmed the Church's "support for the current law on assisted suicide as a means of contributing to a just and compassionate society in which vulnerable people are protected".
And Reverend Rose Hudson-Wilkin, who is the Speaker's chaplain in the House of Commons, said having an assisted suicide law would sanitise death.
"I just happen to believe that matters of life and death in that way is not for us to play with. There are lots and lots of vulnerable people out there... you cannot make a law that is going to have a serious impact on a majority of people."
Dr Peter Saunders, chief executive of the Christian Medical Fellowship said he was concerned about vulnerable people being exploited.
"We've got to think about the people who are going to feel a duty to end their lives so as not to be a burden to others.
"I'm worried about the disabled people, the depressed and elderly, who are going to be put at danger by this bill which really just has eligibility criteria and not safeguards."

Article: The concrete and steel arch will eventually cover the remains of the reactor which lost its roof in a catastrophic explosion in 1986.
The blast sent a plume of radioactive material into the air, triggering a public health emergency across Europe.
The shield is designed to prevent further radioactive material leaking out over the next century.
It measures 275m (900ft) wide and 108m (354ft) tall and has cost $1.6bn (Â£1.3bn) to construct.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), which is leading the project, describes the arch as the largest moveable land-based structure ever built.
Containing the world's worst nuclear accident
Ukraine marks Chernobyl 30th anniversary
In pictures: Chernobyl's eerie exclusion zone
It began moving on Monday using a system of hydraulic jacks and will take about five days to be put in its final position.
Work will then begin to safely dismantle the reactor, which has been sealed inside a so-called sarcophagus, and to secure the huge amount of radioactive material still inside.
Experts fear that if parts of the reactor collapse inside the sarcophagus, further radioactive material could be released.
The shield, known as the New Safe Confinement, had to be built away from the scene of the accident as the radiation immediately above the reactor is still too intense.
Ukraine's ecology minister, Ostap Semerak, said the start of the operation to cover the reactor was "the beginning of the end of a 30-year long fight with the consequences of the 1986 accident".
"The credit for construction of this one-of-a-kind technological structure goes to an expert team of engineers and builders," he said.
The meltdown and explosion at the Soviet-era plant was the worst nuclear disaster in history, spewing a cloud of radioactive material that drifted into other parts of the then-USSR, including Russia and Belarus, and northern Europe.
The number of people killed remains disputed. A 2005 report by the UN-backed Chernobyl Forum said that fewer than 50 people had died as a result of exposure to radiation, most of them workers killed immediately after the disaster, but some survived until as late as 2004.
The forum estimated that up to 9,000 people could eventually die from radiation exposure, although Greenpeace claims the figure could be as high as 93,000.

Article: Ranieri guided Leicester to the title despite them being rated 5,000-1 shots at the start of the 2015-16 campaign.
The Foxes are 17th this season and lost to League One Millwall in the FA Cup.
"It is very sad," said Match of the Day presenter Lineker. "It is inexplicable to me. It's inexplicable to a lot football fans who love the game."
Speaking to BBC Radio 4, the 56-year-old added: "I suppose you can explain it in terms of a panic decision and for me a wrong decision.
"I shed a tear last night for Claudio, for football and for my club."
After news of the 65-year-old Italian's dismissal broke on Thursday, former England captain Lineker, who played for his hometown club for seven seasons, said the "game's gone" in a post on social media.
"It's a sign of modern football, what happened last season was truly extraordinary, " he added on Friday. "The lack of gratitude from the owners of the club and who knows who else involved in such a decision beggars belief.
"That season will remain with us forever, it was truly special and a lot of that was down to the management.
"The same guy cannot be considered incapable of doing the job a few months months later after achieving what, for me, was the biggest miracle in sport."
Chelsea dismissed Jose Mourinho as manager the season after their 2015 title and Lineker says while that is "expected at big clubs", the decision to sack Ranieri "takes away from the glory" for the Foxes.
"For a club like Leicester to win the league last season, the magnificence of the story, the likeability of the club under Ranieri - the ultimate gentleman - it kind of demeans the club.
"Leicester were hugely popular right around the world. To do something like this now loses a lot of that popularity."
France midfielder N'Golo Kante moved to Chelsea for £30m in the summer and Lineker said losing the 25-year-old was "huge".
He added: "There were a whole host of things that made the season fairly inevitable in the sense it would never be anything like last season.
"They had a journeyman back four that was protected brilliantly by Kante. They were an ageing back four, who are a year older.
"All of a sudden they were on pre-season tours, playing Barcelona, travelling all over the world. They were not prepared for the new season and then the confidence aspect sneaks in."
Former Leicester and England goalkeeper Peter Shilton, said the club's struggles this season made Ranieri's sacking understandable.
Speaking to Radio 4, he said: "Going down would be a disaster for Leicester and I suppose the board have made a very brave decision.
"If they stay in the Premier League then they've made the right decision. A lot of people will say there's no sentiment in football, look at what he's done for the club, but he's had a lot of the season to get things going.
"There's obviously some reason why not. We're not privy to that - maybe the board are. Maybe there's unrest in the dressing room, who knows? Maybe the players just aren't performing."
Leicester owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha used social media platform Instagram to explain why he sacked Ranieri.
"We have done our best as management, we do not have only one problem to solve, but there are a million things to do to make our club survive, " the billionaire wrote.
"Please respect my decision, I will never let the club down".

"There's almost a sense of grief in the city today, with many having lost their 'favourite uncle'.
"Claudio Ranieri was the man that brought the dream to life by winning the Premier League title. It has gone sour this term with players underperforming, new signings not working out and baffling tactics at time from the Tinkerman.
"I thought they would get relegated with Ranieri in charge. I hated to say it. I hoped it wouldn't come true and I'd be proved wrong.
"This gives them a chance. A different kind of chance to stay up."
Phil McNulty, BBC chief football writer:
It is almost the thought that dare not speak its name amid the wave of shock, outrage and disgust at Leicester's decision to ruthlessly dismiss the hugely popular 65-year-old, who won the hearts of all supporters with his good humour, class and dignity as he led the Foxes to the title.
But is there actually method in what many see as the madness of the club's Thai owners?
Leicester's fall has been more dramatic than anything they could have foreseen in their worst nightmares. A win for any of Sunderland, Crystal Palace and Hull City this weekend would put the Foxes in the relegation places. Wins for all three and they would be bottom by the time they face Liverpool on what will now be a highly charged occasion at the King Power on Monday.
After 26 games last year they were top on 53 points, two ahead of Spurs. This season they are 17th after 25 games, with only 21 points. Last season they had lost only three games compared with 14 in this campaign, and conceded only 29 goals compared with 43 this term. Indeed, they only conceded 36 in the entire 2015-16 season.
The difference is stark and, very clearly in the opinion of Leicester's owners, dangerous.
Pat Murphy, BBC Radio 5 live
I understand some influential players in the dressing room, who were part of the Nigel Pearson squad a couple of years ago, were making graphic contrasts with team spirit and the organisational qualities of Pearson compared with Ranieri this season.
The club never really lost faith in Pearson this time two years ago. Despite the fact they were in the parlous position, the general feeling was that he had the dressing room and knew where he was going. He left in the summer of 2015 for different reasons - personal reasons associated with his son, who was on the staff.
Quite clearly, Ranieri had lost a lot of key allies in that Leicester dressing room with long memories.
On 7 February, Leicester issued a statement saying Ranieri had their "unwavering support". Sixteen days later they sacked the 65-year-old Italian, who had signed a new four-year deal in the summer.
His departure came a day after the Foxes won praise for their performance despite losing 2-1 in their Champions League last-16 first-leg tie at Sevilla.
"Ranieri was told he was sacked on Thursday afternoon in Leicester once the team returned from Spain, but the suggestion is the owners decided before that defeat by Sevilla," said BBC sports editor Dan Roan.
"The decision was taken very reluctantly but the club's owners are desperate to avoid relegation and its consequences."
Foxes vice-chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha said: "This has been the most difficult decision we have had to make in nearly seven years since King Power took ownership of Leicester City.
"But we are duty-bound to put the club's long-term interests above all sense of personal sentiment, no matter how strong that might be.
"Claudio has brought outstanding qualities to his office. His skilful management, powers of motivation and measured approach have been reflective of the rich experience we always knew he would bring to Leicester City."
Srivaddhanaprabha added: "His warmth, charm and charisma have helped transform perceptions of the club and develop its profile on a global scale. We will forever be grateful to him for what he has helped us to achieve.
"It was never our expectation that the extraordinary feats of last season should be replicated this season. Indeed, survival in the Premier League was our first and only target at the start of the campaign.
"But we are now faced with a fight to reach that objective and feel a change is necessary to maximise the opportunity presented by the final 13 games."
A news conference with Leicester assistant manager Craig Shakespeare will take place at 13:00 GMT on Friday.

Article: The BBC's Anbarasan Ethirajan at the scene says it is a race against time before officials bring in heavy machinery.
He says the smell of decomposing bodies is making some rescuers ill.
More than 350 people have died since Wednesday's disaster and hundreds more are missing.
On Sunday, two more people were pulled alive from the rubble of the eight-storey building in the suburb of Savar as the rescue operation entered its fifth day.
A group of about nine survivors was also located and teams were using light cutting equipment to try to reach them, our correspondent says.
Water and food are being dropped through gaps in the rubble, he adds.
But with hopes fading for those still trapped, officials plan to bring in cranes within the next few hours.
The army officer co-ordinating the rescue, Maj Gen Chowdhury Hasan Suhrawardy, said they would try to save the nine people first by using light equipment.
"But if we fail we will start our next phase within hours," he said.
This would involve heavy equipment including hydraulic cranes and cutters to bore a hole from the top of the collapsed building, he told reporters.
He said they still aimed to recover survivors as well as bodies.
"In this stage, we have no other choice but to use some heavy equipment," he said.
"We will start it within a few hours. Manual operation and use of small equipment is not enough."
On Saturday a total of 29 people were rescued from the destroyed Rana Plaza in the commercial suburb of Savar.
Police have so far arrested three garment factory owners and two engineers in connection with the disaster.
Factory bosses Mahbubur Rahman Tapas and Balzul Samad Adnan surrendered to police early on Saturday while Aminul Islam was arrested later the same day.
Police said they had ordered an evacuation of the building on Tuesday after cracks appeared, but that the factories ignored them and were operating the next day.
The municipal engineers are reported to have approved the safety of the building a day before it collapsed.
The owner of Rana Plaza, Mohammed Sohel Rana, has gone into hiding although police are questioning his wife.
Airport and border authorities have been alerted to stop him from leaving the country, reports say.
One minister has alleged that Rana Plaza was built without permits.
Thousands of relatives of missing workers are waiting at the site as survivors and the dead are pulled from the rubble.
Police said 353 bodies had so far been found, 301 of which had been identified. A further 2,431 people are known to have survived.
There is no official figure on the number of people still missing, but Akram Hossain, a deputy director of the fire service, said their chances of survival were "diminishing by the minute".
The fire service's head of operations, Mahbubur Rahman, said the rescue effort was becoming increasingly difficult for emergency workers as survivors were losing their strength to call for help.
"There are many dead bodies but our top priority is finding those who may still be alive," he told AFP news agency. "There are some survivors. We can hear their feeble cries or hear them talking to each other."
Mr Rahman said rescuers were digging tunnels through the rubble with bare hands, drills and shovels because they feared heavier equipment could cause further collapse.
"Pillars and beams are the biggest problem. Sometimes, even if we can locate survivors, we can't reach them because of these beams. They take a lot of time to cut through."
One of those who was rescued on Saturday, Merina Begum, said she and seven other workers had survived without food or water. She told AFP: "When the rescuers brought juice, ice cream and cold water, it was the tastiest food I've ever had."
Anger at the building collapse has triggered days of violent protests in Dhaka, although streets were said to be quiet on Sunday.
Bangladesh has one of the largest garment industries in the world, providing cheap clothing for major Western retailers that benefit from its widespread low-cost labour.
But the industry has been widely criticised for its low pay and limited rights given to workers and for the often dangerous working conditions in garment factories.

The 32-year-old's first World Series win since 2012 ended the 13-event winning streak of Gwen Jorgensen.
The Welsh triathlete also beat British rival Jodie Stimpson.
"Helen has put a very strong case forward," said Stanford, who has already qualified for Rio along with Vicky Holland.
With an official announcement due in June, two-time world champion Jenkins and England's Commonwealth champion Stimpson are competing to be part of Britain's female triathlon contingent in Rio this summer.
"Personally, I can't see how they can't pick Helen," said Jenkins' Welsh compatriot Stanford.
"British Triathlon were saying that you had to display potential to medal for Rio and she's absolutely done that.
"She's gone out there and won the race and not only that she's beaten Gwen Jorgensen, who is the hot favourite to win gold in Rio, so if you beat her you've shown you have potential to medal so I'd be very surprised if she's not selected."
Stimpson made a strong start to the season, winning the opening World Series event in Abu Dhabi and the sprint distance World Cup in Australia.
But she trailed in 12th, more than three minutes behind the winner, at the Gold Coast.
"Jodie had a fantastic start to the season," added Stanford, the 2013 world champion.
"But sadly she didn't quite have the race she wanted at the Gold Coast which was the actual selection race.
"That was the day they had to really perform and show what they were capable of doing, but she presented a strong case earlier in the year and you never know what the selectors are thinking and which way they will go."
After winning the race in Australia, Jenkins said: "The team is not announced yet but I think I have probably done enough today.
"Our team is so strong and it is so unfair that Jodie might not be going to the Games."

There have been a record number of them held in churches, according to research by one Christian charity.
I've been to a number of hustings so far and there's one reason why they work. The debates and exchanges are close up and often personal.
Voters are able to question the politicians and get beyond some of the campaign sound bites and slogans.
They also often highlight issues that are just overlooked in the "noise" of national campaigning.
That was the case at a hustings at the All Nations for Christ church in the Normanton area of the Derby South constituency, where the audience were mostly from the city's African Caribbean communities.
On the platform, representatives from all the parties, including Dame Margaret Beckett, who's defending a 6,000 Labour majority in Derby South.
There were questions from the audience on immigration, Europe and schools.
But one question particularly gripped the audience: Why were graduates from the African Caribbean communities three times more likely to be out of a job, six months after leaving university?
The study was carried out by the Bow Group think-tank and Elevation Networks, a youth employment charity, and was based on interviews with 2,500 students over two years.
It also found that black students were not being given the same opportunities as white students.
One angry voice in the audience shouted: "That's outrageous and disgraceful".
It got backing from the Greens.
"That indicates there's some form of discrimination going on in the jobs market," said John Devine, the Green Party candidate for Derbyshire's Amber Valley.
There was a suggestion from one questioner for employers to be forced by law to audit who and where they recruit staff.
A precise solution perhaps required a precise response.
But the Conservatives' Derby South candidate Evonne Williams tiptoed round this one.
"It's something that we haven't considered but I'm happy to take it back to the party," she told the questioner.
And Labour's Dame Margaret?
"We're going to be looking at the Equalities Act to see if it needs modernising and updating. So your suggestion is exactly the kind of idea we will be looking at," she said.
One platform speaker wanted to go much further. Lucy Care, the Lib Dem's candidate for Derby North, suggested that all job application forms should no longer include the person's name.
"We would like to have name blank application forms," she said.
"So all you read is their experience and what they've done. Often the name of the applicant can deter some employers from short listing or recruiting."
As for UKIP's Derby South hopeful Victor Webb, he didn't completely rule out having such a recruitment audit, but: "I wouldn't do this because of the burden of cost and regulation on small businesses."
For this hustings audience, maybe no instant solutions but they got the politicians thinking about their concerns.
"The key is getting people engaged," said Marc Grant, the event organiser.
"It's the first time we've held a hustings at the church."
"We wanted to show why politics is so important to our daily lives and I'm really pleased so many  people came along."
Whatever the outcome of this election, the locally organised hustings have emerged as a big campaign winner.

Article: Former Celtic and Republic of Ireland goalkeeper Pat Bonner assesses the victors' performance in Sunday's Scottish League Cup final, while former Aberdeen and Scotland defender Willie Miller gives his marks out of 10 for Derek McInnes' side.
Didn't do too much wrong, couldn't do anything about the goals. Not over-worked, but Celtic had a number of other chances. Not the worst.
In second-half, he came more to life in terms of getting forward, which is a big part of his game.
In team for his height and domination but didn't dominate his opponent or take responsibility for closing gap between defence and midfield. Use of the ball was poor.
Probably his poorest performance for Aberdeen - uncertain, played too deep. He didn't close down James Forrest quickly enough for the second goal and conceded the penalty for the third. Must be disappointed, because he's looked good since coming to the club
Wasn't exposed on too many occasions against Patrick Roberts. Did have the chance with a header and maybe should have done better with it. Moved to centre-back later, his preferred his position. Didn't play to the standard he's capable of.
Not the worst in midfield. Tried hard but played in an area that was dominated by Celtic. Only got close to Celtic's midfielders on a couple of occasions and should have made it more difficult for them.
An opportunity as captain to lift the trophy. He normally gives you an element of control in midfield but didn't do that. The gap between him and his defence was too wide, allowing Roberts, Rogic and Forrest to get in behind.
Largely anonymous in the first-half. Spent his time worrying about defensive duties rather than what he's good at. Turned it around in second half and had a number of good runs, but he's a match winner and he didn't show what he was capable of.
Celtic dominated in midfield and McLean must take responsibility. He's been at the club long enough to know what's expected, should be performing to a high level and on the big stage. If you want to be an international, you have to perform better.
Whenever he got on the ball, you felt, if anything was going to happen creatively, it was going to come through him. He was taken out the game on two or three occasions and Celtic players realised he was the main threat.
Not the Adam Rooney I know. Didn't do much in terms of causing a threat to the two centre-backs, who handled him extremely well. He needed to work harder to make it difficult for them but had little support. Should be a goal threat but didn't do that.
Won a couple of headers, but his timing was out at times after coming on for O'Connor.
Expect more from a player like him. With Hayes, who he replaced, he's the quality in terms of creativity and didn't create anything.
Barely touched the ball after taking over from Rooney. Hard when coming on at 3-0 down.
Had that save from Andrew Considine's first-half header but didn't have much else to do. To force his way back into the side and win a medal, you have to give him great credit.
Fairly comfortable at right-back, as steady as always, and was in control defensively.
Was probably the pick of the back four. Stepping out, he made the opening goal. Passed the ball well throughout.
Strong, powerful figure at the back. Was never put under significant pressure.
Attacked the by-line as always and delivered an early cross for Moussa Dembele to head on target.
Man of the match, dominated proceedings, looked in control and showed flair at times. Won a tackle with O'Connor that probably put paid to the defender for the next five or 10 minutes. Led by example.
Solid display, worked very hard, not over-spectacular and should have scored at the end after getting himself into a great position.
Always capable of doing something in the game. An attacking threat throughout. He plays the position well and scored the opening goal.
Scored Celtic's second goal, laid on a couple, won the penalty for the third. I asked the question before, could he step up? And I think he did.
Probably Celtic's quietest player. Wasn't involved as much as he would have wanted to be.
Probably the quietest we've seen him but still scored his goal. Not as sharp as he normally is but led the line well.
Did what he had do after coming on for Roberts. Kept it nice and solid in midfield.
Another who did his job well and kept the performance ticking over after coming on for Rogic.
Didn't have much time to impress as a late sub for Forrest but didn't do anything wrong.
Pat Bonner and Willie Miller were talking to BBC Scotland's Richard Wilson.

Article: Ex-Labour press chief Alastair Campbell and MP Simon Hughes have also settled with News Group Newspapers (NGN), which published the News of the World.
Mr Gascoigne received £68,000 while Mr Coogan got £40,000.
The comedian said afterwards: "This has never been about the money."
Tony Blair's former spokesman Mr Campbell, who won substantial damages plus costs, also said his action had "not and never has been, about the money".
Liberal Democrat deputy leader Mr Hughes received £45,000 plus costs while football agent Phil Hughes, a friend and former agent of ex-footballer George Best, received substantial damages plus costs.
Hugh Tomlinson QC told the court his client, singer Charlotte Church, had not reached an agreement. The case involving her and her parents is due to start at the end of the month.
By Clive ColemanBBC News legal correspondent
This latest round of settlements represents a continued waving of the white flag by News International in the civil cases for breach of privacy arising out of the phone hacking at the former News of the World.
The vast majority of the original 60-odd cases have now been settled. And the more they settle, the more difficult it becomes for News International to defend one.
The case brought by the singer Charlotte Church and her family is due for trial, as are five other cases.  Whether any of them will actually get there seems doubtful.
The settlement sums reflect the level of hacking, the period over which it took place and the number of articles that were written based upon the information hacked.
But this is not even the beginning of the end. Waiting in the wings, are around 800 additional potential claimants, perhaps more. News International seems to be in for a very long and very costly act of surrender.
Speaking outside the High Court, Mr Coogan said he had taken the action to expose the way in which parts of the press had been operating.
"Like other people who sued, I was determined to do my part to show the depths to which the press can sink in pursuit of private information.
"The police and the Leveson Inquiry will be investigating these matters but at the time, when these civil cases began, News International seemed likely to succeed in covering up the hacking scandal completely.
"Neither the police nor the government were willing to hold those responsible accountable for unlawful acts."
He said some of the phone hacking victims were "many ordinary members of the public, sometimes vulnerable people with the most tenuous connection to news".
Mr Campbell said he would be using the settlement to make donations to organisations, including the Labour Party and Mind, "so that at least some small good for the causes I believe in can come out of the criminality and cultural depravity of others".
"For me, this has been about people with a voice and a platform using them to change the media culture which, as I argued at the Leveson Inquiry, has become putrid in parts," he said.
The announcement of the latest settlements, at a hearing in London, came during the latest in a number of pre-trial reviews.
Mr Campbell said his settlement was a "satisfactory outcome" and NGN had agreed to search for other documents and that he may be entitled to further damages.
Details of the effect hacking had on Mr Gascoigne were given in a statement from his solicitor.
The judge was told the former England international footballer, who also played for Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur, had been the subject of a number of News of the World articles over many years and had "considerable concerns" about the source of some of the "intrusive and private" information.
The statement said: "Mr Gascoigne was worried that the information was being obtained by bugging or tapping his telephone conversations, as a result of which he was accused of being paranoid.
"In addition, Mr Gascoigne was worried that the information was being given to the News of the World by his friends or family, as a result of which he fell out with several of his friends and family."
The statement said the ex-footballer apologised for wrongly accusing those close to him of leaking information.
Those receiving settlements include:
Liberal Democrat deputy leader Mr Hughes said the practice of hacking was "criminal behaviour on an industrial scale."
He added: "We must now make sure that nothing like this can ever happen again."
These latest developments mean 15 more phone hacking cases have now been settled, including nine of the 10 which were due to go to civil trial on Monday. There were 37 other claims settled with NGN last month.
The announcement, at a hearing in London, came during the latest in a number of pre-trial reviews.
Another five phone-hacking cases are still due to be heard.
Those are of model Elle Macpherson's former adviser Mary Ellen Field, footballer Ryan Giggs, former royal butler Paul Burrell, police officer Jacqui Hames and her husband David Cook, and PR consultant Nicola Phillips.

Comedian Steve Coogan and ex-footballer Paul Gascoigne are among the latest people to have settled claims for damages over phone-hacking, the High Court has heard.

Article: His wife Marina can still recall the last time she saw him. He was smiling in what she recalls was a sad way. She said she would be back tomorrow.
"He suddenly just said 'I love you so much'," she remembers.
"I said 'Yes, of course. I love you too'."
But when she got home, she received a call from the hospital telling her to rush back in. She did not get the chance to speak to him again.
As he lay dying in his hospital bed, Alexander Litvinenko had remained the trained operative he had always been and tried to recall for police every detail that might hold a clue to his poisoning.
For the police, he was something unique - a living murder victim - a man who was going to die but had time to talk to them.
So who did he hold responsible for the mysterious illness which was taking such a terrible toll on his body? "Everything that happened to him and he was able to speak - able to sign - he said Putin was responsible for his death," his widow told the BBC.
The public inquiry will examine the central question - who was responsible for what was described by a lawyer in a previous hearing as 'an act of state sponsored nuclear terrorism on the streets of London'?
It was one of the most remarkable and sensitive murder cases in modern times.
"This inquiry was different from any other investigation that I've ever been involved in," says Peter Clarke, who at the time ran the Metropolitan Police Counter-Terrorism Command which handled the investigation.
"It was not only a murder inquiry but there were other key areas that we had to think about: public safety - over 40 sites of radioactive contamination in public places, on public transport, aircraft, offices, restaurants... And then there are the international dimensions, the diplomatic dimensions and the intelligence areas that came into this inquiry."
Much is already known about the broad brush of events - that Alexander Litvinenko was killed by radioactive Polonium 210 and that two Russians, Alexander Lugovoi and Dimitri Kovtun, are believed by police to be responsible.
They are believed to have administered the substance in a cup of tea at the Millennium Hotel's Pine Bar  in central London.  Both men, though, have denied any involvement.
This inquiry may reveal new details of the trail of evidence, though - a radioactive trail which shows that the Pine Bar may have been the third attempt to kill Litvinenko.
But one issue never publicly examined is that of motivation. Why was Litvinenko killed? And crucially - was it on the orders of the Russian state? That is one subject this inquiry will be looking at.
Litvinenko was a former FSB officer who had become a fierce critic of Vladimir Putin, first in Russia and then in Britain where he eventually received citizenship.
The inquiry was formally created in July 2014 after the government finally relented in the face of pressure from Marina Litvinenko and Sir Robert Owen, a judge then sitting as coroner but now chairman of the inquiry.
The inquest process had hit a major problem - the government had demanded that certain material be kept secret but there is no provision for that in an inquest.
So both Marina Litvinenko and Sir Robert argued that the inquest should be converted into a public inquiry in which material can be considered in closed session. The government at first resisted but Marina Litvinenko persisted with legal challenges even as her money began to run out.
In July the government changed its stance. This was seen in some quarters as a reaction to worsening relations with Moscow.
In the past there was suspicion that there was a desire to put the Litvinenko case to bed and get back to business but by last summer the crisis over Ukraine had changed Britain's perspectives on Russia and may have led to the decision to hold an inquiry which could look at the issue of state responsibility.
At a pre-inquest hearing, lawyers for the inquiry said that the material in possession of the British government did establish a 'prima facie case' for the culpability of the Russian state in the death. But this may well be secret intelligence which will not come out in public evidence.
One thing the inquiry will be unlikely to look at in open session is Alexander Litvinenko's relationship with MI6.
At one hearing, a lawyer for the widow of Alexander Litvinenko said that her husband had carried out work for MI6 and had a dedicated handler or case-officer with the pseudonym of Martin.
This, the lawyer argued, meant that the inquest needed to look at whether the British state failed in its duty of care to Alexander Litvinenko by failing to take sufficient steps to protect him - in other words, could it have prevented the murder? In the end that issue was ruled out of the final inquiry.
It has been a long journey. I first interviewed Marina soon after her husband's murder when she showed a determination to uncover the truth.
Speaking to her eight years on, she remains as firm as ever in that pursuit and still has confidence in the ability of the British justice system to deliver final answers, despite all the ups and downs on the way.
The next few months will be the final test of that.

Article: Pick, 21, and Bateman, 25, were caught with anabolic steroids in their systems during out-of-competition tests.
Both players have been suspended from all sport until December 2016.
"The players perhaps thought they had a better chance of getting away with it as it was pre-season," UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) head of science and medicine Nick Wojek told BBC Sport.
"The benefits for rugby players, in both codes, are clear with these kinds of substances. They also allow for a quicker recovery from training sessions or from injuries.
Wojek says that UKAD are taking greater steps to deter players from rugby league and union from taking banned substances.
Last week Neath back-row Lee Evans was banned for two years after he was found to have taken the anabolic steroid drostanolone - although UKAD director Graham Arthur said there was some evidence to support Evans's claim that he had not knowingly taken the banned substance.
"The rewards are potentially very big for players outside the top level attempting to obtain lucrative contracts and there is also an image issue to contend with," Wojek added.
"We are implementing a visible testing program and working with governing bodies to ensure that education strategies are in place within clubs.
"We're also looking to educate players in academies and at school level on the morals of taking banned substances."
Wales international three-quarter Bateman is the club's longest-serving player and signed a contract extension at the third tier side in October 2014.
Scorpions chairman Ian Curzon said: "It is hoped that he will return from this ban both a better person and a better player."
Featherstone forward Pick was a member of the Rovers team that lost 36-12 against Leigh Centurions in the 2014 Championship Grand Final but he has not played this season.
A statement issued by the West Yorkshire club said: "Featherstone Rovers are fully committed to the sport's anti-doping policy and players are educated by the club and governing body as to the penalties they could incur should a positive test be recorded."

Article: Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board (BCUHB) gave £20,000 towards the Lap of Wales Challenge.
But the Wales Audit Office found the board breached its own rules and regulations in handling the funding.
Board officials said they would learn from the experience after auditors highlighted a lack of transparency and poorly-managed conflicts of interest.
Auditors also found the health board failed to follow procurement rules when appointing suppliers for the event.
The Lap of Wales Challenge was organised by Cerddwn Ymlaen under the leadership of its national organiser Eryl Vaughan and was fronted by the Welsh opera singer Rhys Meirion.
The event cost more than £150,000 to arrange and the surplus was £1,368.
The challenge saw a number of Welsh celebrities undertaking a week-long journey through Wales in July 2015 to raise awareness of the Welsh Government's changes to the organ donation law.
It was arranged in aid of Cronfa Elen. The fund was set up by Mr Meirion in memory of his sister who died in 2012, and was incorporated within BCUHB's own official charity, Awyr Las/Blue Sky in 2014.
The health board awarded £20,000 towards the event, with another £20,000 coming from Cardiff and Vale Health Board and £45,000 from the Welsh Government.
The report found £10,000 of BCUHB's contribution was awarded as a loan, but the paperwork was not processed by the health board's financial team.
Despite that, the funds were transferred.
Cerddwn Ymlaen said it was not aware it received a loan rather than a grant and would not have agreed to it, had it known.
To ensure the Lap of Wales project was not in deficit, Cerddwn Ymlaen undertook additional fundraising to meet the £154,054 cost of completing the challenge.
Concerns were also raised about a breach of the health board's financial regulations in relation to the challenge.
A spokesperson for BCUHB said: "The health board was very keen to learn from this experience which is why it asked the Wales Audit Office to carry out this review, as we recognise that to achieve the objectives of the charity, it is important to work with external bodies.
"Such arrangements are underpinned by trust, common objectives and mutual cooperation but misunderstandings can occur."
Officials added a new joint-working protocol would provide a robust governance framework for future projects and require all arrangements to be formalised.

He stepped down from the leadership last September and was replaced by Frank McAveety.
A by-election will be held for his Anderston/City ward, the date of which has yet to be confirmed.
Mr Matheson said: "As a cities man, I am delighted to accept this prestigious appointment which comes at a perfect time for me.
"Having served as a city leader I am fortunate to be in a position to still contribute to the development of international cities in a non-political capacity."
Mr Matheson will be a visiting professor at Strathclyde University's Institute for Future Cities - part of its economics department.
In his role he will be expected to write, lecture and assist with research projects across the UK and abroad.
The move appears to mark the end of Mr Matheson's political ambitions for the moment.
Last year he stood for the depute leadership of the Scottish Labour Party and came second in the first round of voting.
He later decided against putting himself forward as a possible Labour candidate for Holyrood.

Article: Pte Sean Benton, 20, from Hastings, was found with five bullet wounds to his chest in June 1995 while on guard at a perimeter fence at Deepcut.
An original inquest into his death recorded a verdict of suicide.
His family applied for a new hearing after using the Human Rights Act to access evidence held by police.
His twin, Tony Benton, and sister, Tracy Lewis, wept and said: "We are just happy and relieved. It's been too long."
A spokesperson for the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said: "We care deeply about our young recruits and our thoughts remain with the family and friends of Private Sean Benton."

The malevolent culture at Deepcut barracks
Justice Collins said fresh evidence had "come to light which casts some doubt upon the correctness" of the original decision.
He added that under article two of the Human Rights Act there was material that questioned the care Pte Benton received from the Army at the time.
Mrs Lewis said: "Our family had just 20 years with Sean. It has taken us another 21 to secure the thorough, independent inquiry we should have seen immediately after his death."
"For two decades, our family has been tormented by questions about what Sean went through at Deepcut," she added.
"If his death had been properly investigated in 1995, we would have been spared years of uncertainty and pain.
"It should be a source of huge shame to the Ministry of Defence and Surrey Police that our mother had to fight for so long - far longer than she should have had to - to force the authorities to answer basic questions."
The family said the original inquest took less than two hours and heard from six people. A criminal investigation seven years later found no evidence of third party involvement.
Pte Benton's medical records were not obtained and no evidence was gathered or presented about his experiences at the base.
The family, who are represented by human rights group Liberty, believe he was subjected to severe bullying.
In a statement, the MoD said: "The Armed Forces will not tolerate abuse, bullying, or discrimination. All allegations are taken very seriously and will be thoroughly investigated, either by the civil or military police and, where appropriate, action will be taken."
"It would be inappropriate to comment further while legal proceedings are ongoing -  we will assist the coroner as necessary," it added.
Pte Benton was the first of four young soldiers to die at the barracks between 1995 and 2002.
Pte Cheryl James, 18, from Llangollen, North Wales, shot herself in November 1995, according to a second inquest into her death which concluded in June. However, the coroner criticised a lack of training, structure and inappropriate sexual relationships in the camp.
Pte James' father, Des, said he had applied to the MoD for a full public inquiry into what went on at the barracks.
Pte Geoff Gray, 17, from Hackney, east London, was found dead with two gunshot wounds to his head on 17 September 2001.
Pte James Collinson, 17, from Perth, was found dead with a single gunshot wound through his chin on 23 March 2002.
A date for the fresh inquest into Pte Benton's death is yet to be set.
