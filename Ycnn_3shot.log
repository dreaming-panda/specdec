Article: Just over a decade ago Gianfranco Zola was voted the greatest Chelsea player of all time in a poll of the club's supporters. This may seem a little premature, but as Eden Hazard prepares for to make his 100th Barclays Premier League appearance for Chelsea at QPR on Sunday, the little magician could have a rival in years to come. Hazard is some player, one of the elite in English football with those dazzling runs and the sparkling feet that can open up the best defences in the league. Eden Hazard has developed into one of the world's best players after flourishing at Chelsea. Hazard has proven himself as a goalscorer and a creator of chances during his time with Chelsea. Hazard celebrates scoring against Hull earlier this season as Chelsea march towards the Premier League title. This season he has been imperious, full of movement and flexibility as Chelsea close in on a double of Capital One Cup and Premier League in Jose Mourinho's second season back at Stamford Bridge. After Chelsea's 1-1 draw with Paris Saint-Germain in February at the Parc des Princes, Mourinho demanded more protection from referees for Hazard. Chelsea's dancing winger is a marked man. The PFA young player of the year had been fouled nine times, with Laurent Blanc's team taking it in turns to nobble the Chelsea No 10 in the first leg of their Champions League second round tie. He has scored some special goals, 17 so far with another nine assists, as Mourinho's team close in on a fourth Premier League title in the Abramovich era. On Sunday, April 26 the PFA players' player of the year award could be his, joining a list of winners that includes Luis Suarez, Gareth Bale, Wayne Rooney, Cristiano Ronaldo, Thierry Henry and his Chelsea team-mate John Terry in recent times. He has grown to love English football, adapting to the demands of the Premier League and the numerous managers he has already played for since his move from Lille in 2012. Roberto Di Matteo was still Chelsea's manager when Hazard tweeted that he was joining 'this season's Champions League winner' ahead of his £32million move from France. He made an impressive start in the Premier League, assisting the opening goal for Chelsea in the 2-0 victory at Wigan and winning the penalty for Frank Lampard to convert at the DW Stadium. Hazard joined Chelsea from Lille for £32million in 2012 after the Blues beat a host to clubs to his signature. Hazard was involved in a controversial incident at Swansea when he kicked the ball as it lay under the ball boy. Hazard was sent off after the ball-boy incident as Chelsea were beaten in the Capital One Cup semi-final. Hazard, his wife Natasha and their kids enjoy some off time at Disneyland Paris. Di Matteo loved him as a player and he went through a notable dip in form when the European Cup-winning coach was fired after the 4-1 defeat against Juventus in the Champions League. A few months later he was sent off when he infamously wrestled with a ball-boy during Chelsea's Capital One Cup semi-final defeat against Swansea City at the Liberty Stadium. He finished the season with a Europa League medal after Chelsea's victory over Benfica the Amsterdam ArenA, but it is the arrival of Mourinho that has transformed his game. Last season there was a period of frustration among Chelsea's first team players because they shared the view of the coach that they had signed a world class talent. Despite his ability he was often one of the first to leave after training, heading home to his family - wife Natasha and their two young children, after a quick shower and lunch with his team-mates. Slowly he has bought into dressing room culture. There is a ruthless streak about him these days and Mourinho, to his credit, drew it out of him after meeting Hazard's father, along with his lawyer, after Belgium's disappointing World Cup in Brazil. Hazard has grown in stature since he was handed Juan Mata's old No 10 shirt, requesting the jersey after the winger left for Manchester United in January 2014. The No 10 shirt is also the number of his hero Zinedine Zidane, the player a young Hazard idolised when he was making his way through Belgian football before his move to Lille. In recent times he has been encouraged to drift across the front three positions, interchanging with Oscar (in the centre) and Willian (on the right) when it takes his fancy. Hazard helped Chelsea win the Europa League under Rafa Benitez when they beat Benfica in the final. Hazard, pictured alongside Luis Suarez, was named the PFA Young Player of the Year last season. Hazard added a second trophy to his Chelsea collection this season when the Blues won the Capital One Cup. Jose Mourinho transformed Hazard's game after he suffered a dip following the departure of Roberto Di Matteo. Mourinho poses with Hazard after he was named Chelsea's Player of the Year last season. He is the focal point of Chelsea's attack, a willing outlet with a first touch that you can melt when he takes it on the instep of his right boot. He has been scoring goals again, adding to his tally this season in recent weeks with strikes for club and country as the season hurtles towards the finish line. At 24 he is maturing nicely, a humble man who impressed Chelsea's hierarchy during the complex negotiations over a new contract towards the end of last year. He has never been responsible for the glut of stories linking him with a move back to France to play for Paris Saint-Germain and he consistently told the club that he was willing to remain at Stamford Bridge. Hazard's contract talks were reminiscent of Gary Neville at Manchester United, leaving it with the club to determine the terms on his new five-year contract. Chelsea settled on £200,000 a week. To those who know him, he speaks of trophies and a hunger to be remembered as a player who contributed to one of the most successful periods in Chelsea's history. Given time, he could even be remembered as the very best. Hazard recently signed a bumper new five-year deal at Chelsea worth £200,000 a week. In Hazard, Gianfranco Zola may soon have a rival as Chelsea's greatest ever player.

Eden Hazard will make his 100th league appearance for Chelsea on Sunday. The Belgian's form dipped when Roberto Di Matteo left the club. But Jose Mourinho's return helped take Hazard to another level. The midfielder has slowly bought into the dressing room culture. Initially he was one of the first to leave the training ground. In time, he could rival Gianfranco Zola as the club's greatest player.

Article: Most parents have the souvenir of a scan of their child in the womb at 12 weeks. The must-have for IVF mums and dads these days, however, is a video and pictures right from the moment of conception. The images are thanks to revolutionary technology that allows medics to record the microscopic miracle of life – from fertilisation to the division of cells, right through to the growth of an embryo. Hundreds of parents are now the proud owners of these EmbryoScope images, which are also helping scientists learn more about the IVF process. Scroll down for video. Pictured is the very first cell division of Pixie Morley, now aged nine months, taken using the revolutionary EmbryoScope technology. Sally and Stephen Morley (pictured with their daughter Pixie) are one of some 1,500 couples in Britain who have had babies using EmbryoScope technology. Sally and Stephen Morley are among them. The grainy grey and white picture on this page shows the first cell division in the creation of their IVF baby, Pixie. A tiny camera, placed inside an incubator, films the reproduction process. As well as allowing parents to watch back the moment the embryos form, the technology – developed in the US – also allows experts to select the best possible embryos based on how they form during the conception process. This narrows a mother’s chance of miscarrying. The Morleys, from Walsall, had spent months trying to have children naturally before opting for IVF. Mrs Morley, 38, the head of a nursery, said: ‘I knew time was against me being 36 when we started trying so when I failed to get pregnant each month I knew we should have fertility tests as soon as possible.’ While the couple were undergoing IVF, the EmbryoScope technology was introduced at the Midland Fertility Clinic, allowing them to be the first in their area to capture their child’s conception on camera. The technology allows medics and parents to watch the cell dividing. Pictured is the cell division of now nine-month-old Pixie. In October 2013, the embryo was transferred into Mrs Morley’s womb and within two weeks she was told by doctors that the process had been successful. Now, nine months after Pixie’s birth, she is still able to re-watch the moment her daughter was conceived. Experts have hailed the technology as one of the most important developments in IVF. Professor Simon Fishel, who is boss of Care Fertility, the first clinic in Britain to use the EmbryoScope, said: ‘We now know that embryos that do make babies and embryos that don’t make babies do different things. 'And to be able to see this in a time-matched movie and to be able to analyse it scientifically is absolutely wonderful science for us.’ Professor Fishel, who was part of the team that produced first test-tube baby, Louise Brown, in 1978, said the EmbryoScope was revealing the secrets about what happens to embryos as they develop – and why it is that around 70 per cent of them do not actually make babies. The videos were also an emotional milestone in the process of becoming a parent, Professor Fishel said. ‘The couple can see the process of fertilisation, see the cells divide, see the number of cells grow and see them produce an embryo…it is nothing short of observing the wonderful miracle of life.’ The video given to parents is a sped-up version of the process which occurs before the embryo develops. Professor Fishel said his patients were ‘awestruck’ when given the footage but that the clinic only gave parents the video once a mother had fallen pregnant. He added that, at across the Care Fertility clinics, 1,000 couples, who had gone on to have a baby, had been given footage of their embryo’s development.

Article: (CNN)The Palestinian Authority officially became the 123rd member of the International Criminal Court on Wednesday, a step that gives the court jurisdiction over alleged crimes in Palestinian territories. The formal accession was marked with a ceremony at The Hague, in the Netherlands, where the court is based. The Palestinians signed the ICC's founding Rome Statute in January, when they also accepted its jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed "in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, since June 13, 2014." Later that month, the ICC opened a preliminary examination into the situation in Palestinian territories, paving the way for possible war crimes investigations against Israelis. As members of the court, Palestinians may be subject to counter-charges as well. Israel and the United States, neither of which is an ICC member, opposed the Palestinians' efforts to join the body. But Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad al-Malki, speaking at Wednesday's ceremony, said it was a move toward greater justice. "As Palestine formally becomes a State Party to the Rome Statute today, the world is also a step closer to ending a long era of impunity and injustice," he said, according to an ICC news release. "Indeed, today brings us closer to our shared goals of justice and peace." Judge Kuniko Ozaki, a vice president of the ICC, said acceding to the treaty was just the first step for the Palestinians. "As the Rome Statute today enters into force for the State of Palestine, Palestine acquires all the rights as well as responsibilities that come with being a State Party to the Statute. These are substantive commitments, which cannot be taken lightly," she said. Rights group Human Rights Watch welcomed the development. "Governments seeking to penalize Palestine for joining the ICC should immediately end their pressure, and countries that support universal acceptance of the court's treaty should speak out to welcome its membership," said Balkees Jarrah, international justice counsel for the group. "What's objectionable is the attempts to undermine international justice, not Palestine's decision to join a treaty to which over 100 countries around the world are members." In January, when the preliminary ICC examination was opened, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described it as an outrage, saying the court was overstepping its boundaries. The United States also said it "strongly" disagreed with the court's decision. "As we have said repeatedly, we do not believe that Palestine is a state and therefore we do not believe that it is eligible to join the ICC," the State Department said in a statement. It urged the warring sides to resolve their differences through direct negotiations. "We will continue to oppose actions against Israel at the ICC as counterproductive to the cause of peace," it said. But the ICC begs to differ with the definition of a state for its purposes and refers to the territories as "Palestine." While a preliminary examination is not a formal investigation, it allows the court to review evidence and determine whether to investigate suspects on both sides. Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said her office would "conduct its analysis in full independence and impartiality." The war between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza last summer left more than 2,000 people dead. The inquiry will include alleged war crimes committed since June. The International Criminal Court was set up in 2002 to prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. CNN's Vasco Cotovio, Kareem Khadder and Faith Karimi contributed to this report.

Article: Whatever you call them, it's always something of a surprise when a game between the biggest and best teams in any country actually turns out to be a footballing classic. Real Madrid and Barcelona attract viewers, but the cynicism on the pitch can drown out the quality in El Clasico. Borussia Dortmund are not consistently good enough to make Der Klassiker a regular spectacle. English football's closest equivalent, Liverpool taking on Manchester United, is now merely a battle for the top four. But, on Easter Sunday, Marseille and Paris St Germain played out a game that not only had a huge bearing on the Ligue 1 title race, but also easily lived up to it's billing as Le Classique. Paris St Germain players celebrate their win in the dressing room after the game, after twice coming from behind to beat rivals Marseille. Andre-Pierre Gignac gets up above Marquinhos to power home the opening goal for Marseille after half an hour. Blaise Matuidi is congratulated by his team-mates after bringing PSG level with a superb curling effort from the edge of the box. Gignac fires home his second goal past Salvatore Sirigu after a mistake from Marco Veratti gave him a clear run on goal, to make it 2-1. Marquinhos jumps for joy after slamming the ball into the roof of the net to make it 2-2 after Zlatan Ibrahimovic's mis-hit free kick. Ibrahimovic put pressure on Jeremy Morel to force an own goal just two minutes later, as PSG went ahead for the first time in the game. Marseille: Mandanda, Romao, Fanni, Morel, Lemina, Dja Djédjé, Mendy, Payet, Thauvin (Ocampos 63 mins), Gignac (Batshuayi 71), Ayew (Alessandrini 72) Subs not used: Aloe, N'Koulou, Samba, Tuiloma. Goals: Gignac 30, 43. Booked: Romao, Fanni, Ayew, Gignac. PSG: Sirigu, Marquinhos, Thiago Silva, David Luiz (Van der Wiel 34), Maxwell, Verratti, Motta, Matuidi, Pastore (Rabiot 82), Ibrahimovic, Cavani (Lavezzi 59),. Subs not used: Douchez, Cabaye, Bahebeck, Digne. Goals: Matuidi 35 Marquinhos 49, Morel OG 51. Booked: Veratti, Pastore. In the end it was PSG who ran out winners, but they twice had to come from behind to see off their fierce rivals in a game that had passion, quality, and goals aplenty. The game was decided by a 130-second burst soon after the half-time break, in which the visitors came from 2-1 down to go 3-2 ahead, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic, predictably, involved in both goals, though not perhaps, in the way that would be expected. First the Swedish star slipped as he struck a free kick at goal, only to see his nothing effort land at the feet of Brazilian defender Marquinhos, who slammed the ball into the roof of the net from close range. Just two minutes later Ibrahimovic might have been on hand to tap home Javier Pastore's low cross, but in the end his presence was enough to force defender Jeremy Morel to divert it past his own goalkeeper. It felt harsh on Marseille, who were the better side for large periods, but they were let down by defensive frailties and an inability to really punhish the PSG backline. Despite the hosts dominance of possession, the champions could easily have won this by three or four goals, such were their chances. Ibrahimovic had several excellent opportunities, the last of which saw Steve Mandanda pull off a remarkable save, while Pastore should have scored at least once, and Mandanda also did well to deny Matuidi late on. All of that without considering the chances the visitors missed before falling behind in the first half, with Ibrahimovic denied a penalty following a clumsy tackle by Morel, Pastore firing wide when clean through, and the woefully out of form Edinson Cavani scuffing a volley straight at the keeper after being picked out by a beautiful chipped pass. Zlatan Ibrahimovic (left) challenges for the ball against Jeremy Morel in the crucial top of the table clash in Ligue 1 on Easter Sunday. Dimitri Payet gets a shot away under pressure from Marco Veratti of PSG in the Stade Veledrome as Marseille looked to take home advantage. On the other hand it is difficult to remember Salvatore Sirigu making too many meaningful saves in the second half, although he did acrobatically tip a Gignac header over the bar shortly before the break to deny the striker a hat-trick. With Lyon having briefly gone top of the table by beating Guingamp earlier in the weekend, it was a game both sides really needed to win to keep up their title challenges. The result puts Laurent Blanc's men top of Ligue 1 again, and is a serious dent to Marseille's hopes. It all looked so different at half time, when an Andre-Pierre Gignac double had his side 2-1 up. The local-born hero first rose above Marquinhos at the back post to head past Sirigu on the half-hour, before slotting past the Italian shortly before half time to restore the lead. Both goals had an element of fortune, with Gignac climbing all over his defender to convert Dimitri Payet's cross, and Marco Veratti gifting him possession through on goal for the second, but nonetheless he took both well. In between was the pick of the goals, a stunner from Blaise Matuidi, who cut inside beautifully, before curling in from the edge of the box, via the fingertips of Mandanda and the inside of the post. PSG's win was marred only by an injury to David Luiz, withdrawn in the first half with what looked like a hamstring pull. But a win over their fierce rivals, and the return to the table's summit, will soften that blow. David Luiz is brought down, and the Brazilian defender was forced off soon after with a hamstring injury which looked serious. Marseille took the lead twice in the first half, but on both occasions they were unable to stay ahead for too long. Gignac celebrates his second goal, and the Marseille striker was only denied his hat-trick by an acrobatic save from Sirigu. Ibrahimovic looks on unimpressed during a difficult first half for the French champions, but his side kept responding to going behind. Marquihos wheels away after scoring his goal, which made the score 2-2 early in the second half, and changed the momentum of the game. The fiery atmosphere bubbled over late on, as Ezequiel Lavezzi was targeted with missiles and laser pointers while trying to take a corner. The home fans produced a passionate atmosphere in the cauldron of the Veledrome as they pursued the French title against their rivals.

Andre-Pierre Gignac puts Marseille ahead on half-hour with powerful back-post header from Dimitri Payet cross. Blaise Matuidi equalises five minutes later with a stunning strike from the edge of the box. Gignac capitalises on terrible PSG defending to restore Marseille's lead before half time. Marquinhos brings PSG level again, before Jeremy Morel own goal puts champions ahead moments later.

Article: (CNN)Never mind cats having nine lives. A stray pooch in Washington State has used up at least three of her own after being hit by a car, apparently whacked on the head with a hammer in a misguided mercy killing and then buried in a field -- only to survive. That's according to Washington State University, where the dog -- a friendly white-and-black bully breed mix now named Theia -- has been receiving care at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital. Four days after her apparent death, the dog managed to stagger to a nearby farm, dirt-covered and emaciated, where she was found by a worker who took her to a vet for help. She was taken in by Moses Lake, Washington, resident Sara Mellado. "Considering everything that she's been through, she's incredibly gentle and loving," Mellado said, according to WSU News. "She's a true miracle dog and she deserves a good life." Theia is only one year old but the dog's brush with death did not leave her unscathed. She suffered a dislocated jaw, leg injuries and a caved-in sinus cavity -- and still requires surgery to help her breathe. The veterinary hospital's Good Samaritan Fund committee awarded some money to help pay for the dog's treatment, but Mellado has set up a fundraising page to help meet the remaining cost of the dog's care. She's also created a Facebook page to keep supporters updated. Donors have already surpassed the $10,000 target, inspired by Theia's tale of survival against the odds. On the fundraising page, Mellado writes, "She is in desperate need of extensive medical procedures to fix her nasal damage and reset her jaw. I agreed to foster her until she finally found a loving home." She is dedicated to making sure Theia gets the medical attention she needs, Mellado adds, and wants to "make sure she gets placed in a family where this will never happen to her again!" Any additional funds raised will be "paid forward" to help other animals. Theia is not the only animal to apparently rise from the grave in recent weeks. A cat in Tampa, Florida, found seemingly dead after he was hit by a car in January, showed up alive in a neighbor's yard five days after he was buried by his owner. The cat was in bad shape, with maggots covering open wounds on his body and a ruined left eye, but remarkably survived with the help of treatment from the Humane Society.

Article: Liverpool vice-captain Jordan Henderson thinks his side could catch Manchester City in the Barclays Premier League having fought through a tough and long season at Anfield. Henderson and Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet both played their 47th game of season in the 2-0 win over Newcastle United on Monday night, equalling the record for appearances by any player in the top five European leagues so far this campaign.

Newcastle had what looked a strong shout for a penalty when Dejan Lovren appeared to foul Ayoze Perez in the area, and Allen admitted he thought it was a spot-kick. 'I did get a good view of it as I'd missed the ball in the build-up,' he said. 'It look a good shout for a penalty, but I didn't get one the other night. These things happen.'

Article: Stuart McCall  watched Rangers bounce back to winning ways before warning his players they must show further improvement in the push for promotion. The Ibrox side recovered from their defeat against Queen of the South as two goals from Nicky Law and one each from Nicky Clark and Haris Vuckic swamped Raith Rovers in a 4-0 victory. McCall, though, wasn’t happy with some of lax moments within their performance and insisted that better will be needed for Wednesday night’s trip to face a Livingston side fighting for survival. Nicky Law celebrates after putting his side 3-0 up as Rangers cruised to victory over Raith. That meeting with the Championship’s bottom club is Rangers’ game in hand over Hibernian, providing the chance to push three points clear in the battle for second place. ‘It was okay,’ reflected McCall on the victory over Rovers, who are locked in mid-table safety. ‘There were some nice goals, although we were sloppy at times. ‘For a little period in the second-half of 20 minutes, we went through the motions and we can’t afford to do that. ‘It was pleasing in a few senses with some nice goals, some decent football and a clean sheet. ‘But we certainly know that Wednesday night will be a different challenge. I was at the Alloa versus Dumbarton game on Saturday and you could sense that Alloa had everything to play for and Dumbarton nothing bar pride, obviously. ‘I thought the game today might pan out as it did, but Wednesday will be different with Livingston flying in terms of their recent results. ‘There is no singing and dancing today. We have done OK. I still think that we’ll need to be better and we can be better,’ said McCall. Stuart McCall has warned Rangers to be on their guard against Livingston in midweek. The pick of the Rangers goals again came from Vuckic, who has scored in each of his last five Ibrox appearances. The Newcastle United loanee has netted seven times in 12 Rangers outings overall. ‘We tried to swap it around by playing a diamond and by getting Haris into more space,’ added McCall, who expects another of the loanees, Shane Ferguson, to begin training with Rangers today. ‘But he still tends to head for the right-hand side, which is his favourite. ‘Every time he cuts in onto his left, you expect the net to bulge. ‘We had good footballers in there with him, Nicky Law, Dean Shiels and Andrew Murdoch, who I thought was terrific again. ‘I said from day one that Haris has got fantastic ability. ‘Obviously, he has got fitter having played more games now, and his match fitness is now looking strong at the end of games where he was flagging after 50 or 60 minutes earlier. ‘That’s just having more time on the park. He is important to us and he is a goal threat.’ Nicky Clark (left) heads it home to give Rangers an early lead. Raith Rovers manager Grant Murray feels Rangers have improved under McCall, but he also believes that whichever Championship side comes through the play-offs will face a difficult task to clear the final promotion hurdle. ‘They still have to go and play a Premier League team and there is a good chance that that team will have a winning mentality,’ said Murray. ‘People are talking about Ross County or Motherwell - well it won’t be an easy task going to these kind of places. ‘I think everyone is talking about how Rangers have picked up now and they look like a strong team who will finish second. ‘Hibs have had a fantastic season, too, in terms of the attacking football they play, but I think Queen of the South are also keeping themselves in there. ‘We knew Rangers would come at us after losing on Thursday and we knew it would be difficult. It is difficult coming to places like this and you have to stand up and have the right mentality. But going a goal down so early put us on the back foot.’

Rangers beat Raith 4-0 but McCall is aware of tough test Livingston will provide in midweek. He said he was concerned about some lax moments in the win at Ibrox. Rangers can go three points clear of Hibernian with a win. 'There is no singing and dancing today. We have done OK. I still think that we’ll need to be better and we can be better,' McCall said.

Article: (CNN)If you've been following the news lately, there are certain things you doubtless know about Mohammad Javad Zarif. He is, of course, the Iranian foreign minister. He has been U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's opposite number in securing a breakthrough in nuclear discussions that could lead to an end to sanctions against Iran -- if the details can be worked out in the coming weeks. And he received a hero's welcome as he arrived in Iran on a sunny Friday morning. "Long live Zarif," crowds chanted as his car rolled slowly down the packed street. You may well have read that he is "polished" and, unusually for one burdened with such weighty issues, "jovial." An Internet search for "Mohammad Javad Zarif" and "jovial" yields thousands of results. He certainly has gone a long way to bring Iran in from the cold and allow it to rejoin the international community. But there are some facts about Zarif that are less well-known. Here are six:. In September 2013, Zarif tweeted "Happy Rosh Hashanah," referring to the Jewish New Year. That prompted Christine Pelosi, the daughter of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, to respond with a tweet of her own: "Thanks. The New Year would be even sweeter if you would end Iran's Holocaust denial, sir." And, perhaps to her surprise, Pelosi got a response. "Iran never denied it," Zarif tweeted back. "The man who was perceived to be denying it is now gone. Happy New Year." The reference was likely to former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who had left office the previous month. Zarif was nominated to be foreign minister by Ahmadinejad's successor, Hassan Rouhami. His foreign ministry notes, perhaps defensively, that "due to the political and security conditions of the time, he decided to continue his education in the United States." That is another way of saying that he was outside the country during the demonstrations against the Shah of Iran, which began in 1977, and during the Iranian Revolution, which drove the shah from power in 1979. Zarif left the country in 1977, received his undergraduate degree from San Francisco State University in 1981, his master's in international relations from the University of Denver in 1984 and his doctorate from the University of Denver in 1988. Both of his children were born in the United States. The website of the Iranian Foreign Ministry, which Zarif runs, cannot even agree with itself on when he was born. The first sentence of his official biography, perhaps in a nod to the powers that be in Tehran, says Zarif was "born to a religious traditional family in Tehran in 1959." Later on the same page, however, his date of birth is listed as January 8, 1960. And the Iranian Diplomacy website says he was born in in 1961. So he is 54, 55 or maybe even 56. Whichever, he is still considerably younger than his opposite number, Kerry, who is 71. The feds investigated him over his alleged role in controlling the Alavi Foundation, a charitable organization. The U.S. Justice Department said the organization was secretly run on behalf of the Iranian government to launder money and get around U.S. sanctions. But last year, a settlement in the case, under which the foundation agreed to give a 36-story building in Manhattan along with other properties to the U.S. government, did not mention Zarif's name. Early in the Iranian Revolution, Zarif was among the students who took over the Iranian Consulate in San Francisco. The aim, says the website Iranian.com -- which cites Zarif's memoirs, titled "Mr. Ambassador" -- was to expel from the consulate people who were not sufficiently Islamic. Later, the website says, Zarif went to make a similar protest at the Iranian mission to the United Nations. In response, the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations offered him a job. In fact, he has now spent more time with Kerry than any other foreign minister in the world. And that amount of quality time will only increase as the two men, with help from other foreign ministers as well, try to meet a June 30 deadline for nailing down the details of the agreement they managed to outline this week in Switzerland.

Article: Dundee have vowed to stand by Paul McGowan after the bad boy midfielder was spared jail for a third assault on a policeman. But the Dens Park bad boy will miss two forthcoming games against former club Celtic because he is under house arrest. The 27-year-old has been placed on a 16-week restriction of liberty order which confines him to home between the hours of 7pm and 7am. And the Dark Blues face Ronny Deila's night next Wednesday night – before a Friday night trip to Parkhead on May 1. McGowan was handed his third conviction for assaulting a police officer at Airdrie Sheriff Court. As a St Mirren player he was sentenced to 130 hours of unpaid work and handed a one-year supervision order in January 2014 after admitting kicking two officers. The court heard McGowan 'charged towards' two police officers after a disturbance in Airdrie in the early hours of November 23 last year. He later kicked another officer on the body while being detained at Coatbridge police station. Paul McGowan avoided a prison sentence after a third assault on a policeman. Sheriff Derek O'Carroll spared the Dens star a prison sentence after hearing he had was undergoing counselling through PFA Scotland, the players' union, for a gambling problem in addition to social work sessions. In a statement Dundee vowed to support their player through his problems saying: 'The club does not condone the behaviour which has led to this and wouldn't from any member of our staff. 'We fully respect the decision made by the court and Dundee FC will be standing by the player. 'Paul is an integral part of the club and we will be working alongside the PFA with him as he bids to positively resolve his off the field issues. 'With the support of his manager, his teammates and club staff we hope Paul will be able to move forward and be part of another successful season next year at Dens Park. 'The club will be making no further comment on the matter.' His solicitor, Liam O'Donnell, told the court that social work reports 'finally give some indication that the accused is getting it in terms of his offending. He added: 'He was not in any trouble from the age of 16 to 23. At age 23 he separated from his partner. The reason he separated has been attributed to an underlying gambling problem. The 27-year-old Dundee midfielder pictured in action against Dundee United last week. 'This gambling problem seems to be the root of his offending. When he takes alcohol his anger about the gambling problem seems to come out through aggression.' O'Donnell revealed the former St Mirren player was undergoing voluntary counselling each week through the Paisley-based RCA Trust, which helps people with alcohol and gambling addictions. 'He is fully supported by his club,' he added. 'The managing director of Dundee Football Club is present in court to indicate his support because he is addressing matters.' After listening to the address, Sheriff O'Carroll reminded McGowan of the previous occasions he had been convicted of offences, in 2010 and 2013. 'And here you are again facing similar charges,' O'Carroll added. 'It's quite correct to say that you are on the cusp of custody and certainly that's in the thoughts of the court.' However, he proceeded to sentence McGowan to the tagging order provided he continues with the counselling. 'If you breach the order you will be brought back here and I have already advised you what the outcome will be,' the sheriff added. Dundee managing director John Nelms, who was accompanied in court by players including captain James McPake, declined to answer questions outside court. McGowan also declined to comment but O'Donnell said afterwards: 'He is relieved with the outcome and he knows he needs to modify his behaviour. He appreciates the support of his club and others.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Article: Juan Mata described Manchester United's 4-2 derby victory as a'massive win' as they opened up a four-point gap on Manchester City. United had lost their last four meetings with City but goals from Ashley Young, Marouane Fellaini, Mata and Chris Smalling gave the Red Devils their biggest derby win for six years. Sergio Aguero opened the scoring and also netted late on for his 100th City goal but United were by far the better team to tighten their grip on third spot in the Barclays Premier League. Old Trafford roars with Marouane Fellaini after the influential Belgian gave the Red Devils the lead. Wayne Rooney leaps onto Fellaini's back after United take the lead at Old Trafford in the Manchester derby. 'The first 10 or 15 minutes they were brilliant and played well but after that the team showed character and we came back,' Mata told Sky Sports 1. 'It's a massive win for us, it's a great result and everyone at United is happy. 'The atmosphere was crazy, it is something we will never forget. Juan Mata, released by Rooney, scores as Manchester United smash their rivals at Old Trafford. 'You could tell how important it was for the fans but we still have six games to go and we have to keep going. 'It's a big win and a boost of confidence but Arsenal are doing great and I'm sure City and Liverpool will fight to the end, so we have to fight to the last minute.' Young equalised Aguero's early strike and then set up Fellaini to give United a first-half lead. All of United's outfield players congratulate Chris Smalling after his close-range header ensured victory. 'We were disappointed to go a goal behind but we showed that team spirit to get back in the game and no other team was going to win it when we went ahead,' Young told Sky Sports 1. 'It was an amazing feeling to score. I was delighted to put the ball in the net and get an assist as well but the important thing was we showed that character to win the game. 'It was a magnificent win. We knew it was going to be a tough game but we knew we had to get the three points.' Ashley Young latches on to a loose ball which bounced off Gael Clichy and fires past the despairing Joe Hart.

Article: Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina has a Premier League win ratio of 91.7 per cent - the highest of any player to have made at least 10 appearances. Following the Gunners' 1-0 win against Burnley at Turf Moor on Saturday, the Colombia international took his tally to 11 wins from 12 games since he displaced Wojciech Szczesny as No 1 in January. Ospina has kept six clean sheets in those 12 games with his only defeat coming against Tottenham in the north London derby on February 7 to boast an impressive win percentage. But who else makes the top 10? Ospina has the highest win ratio of any Premier League player to make more than 10 appearances. The Arsenal goalkeeper has won 11 of his 12 games in the league since displacing Wojciech Szczesny. Former Manchester City defender Stefan Savic (right) won 10 of his 11 games in the league before being sold. Former Manchester City defender Stefan Savic, who was deemed not good enough after making just 11 Premier League appearances before being sold to Fiorentina, is second behind Ospina. The Montenegro international has a win ratio of 90.9 per cent after appearing on the losing side just once during his only season with the Premier League champions. Gerard Pique, who spent four years at Manchester United, makes up the top three after winning 10 of his 12 Premier League games before rejoining Barcelona and going on to win countless trophies, including a World Cup with Spain. Gerard Pique made 12 Premier League appearances for Manchester United, winning 10 of them. Arjen Robben posts an impressive 82.1 per cent win ration in the Premier League from 67 matches. Asier del Horno won 20 times during his only season in the Premier League with Chelsea in 2005-06. Arjen Robben has arguably the most impressive stats of any player on the list for the number of appearances he made for Chelsea during a three-year spell. The Bayern Munich winger was on the winning side an incredible 55 times from his 67 games giving him a win ration of 82.1 per cent. Another former Chelsea player Asier del Horno is fifth on the list with 80 per cent and is followed by current Arsenal right back Hector Bellerin with 78.6. Arsenal right back Hector Bellerin (left) has won 11 of his 14 league games this season. Manchester United forward James Wilson has won 10 of 13 appearances in the league. Igor Stepanov made 17 appearances for Arsenal in the early 2000s and won 13 matches. Manchester United's 19-year-old striker James Wilson has only failed to be on the winning side three times from his 13 appearances putting him seventh on the list, while former Arsenal defender Igor Stepanovs' 76.5 per cent is enough to put him eighth. Nacho Monreal, currently preferred to Kieran Gibbs as Arsenal left back, has won 43 games from his 57 appearances for Arsene Wenger's side. United defender Paddy McNair sneaks into the top 10 with 75 per cent having featured 12 times under Louis van Gaal this season, winning nine. When did Ospina join Arsenal? Arsenal signed Ospina from Ligue 1 side Nice last summer. The 26-year-old made close to 200 appearances for the French club during six seasons. How much did Arsenal pay for him? Originally signed as back-up and competition for Wojciech Szczesny after the Gunners No 2 Lukasz Fabianski joined Swansea, Ospina cost a paltry £3million. Is he of international calibre? Ospina had won 52 caps for Colombia and impressed during their run to the World Cup quarter-final in Brazil last summer. When did Ospina make his first appearance for Arsenal? Ospina made his debut for Arsenal in a 2-1 defeat by Southampton in the third round of the Capital One Cup back in September and only made one further appearance in the Champions League before 2015. When did he displace Wojciech Szczesny as No 1? Ospina was recalled to the starting line-up as Arsenal beat Hull 2-0 in the FA Cup third round in January after Szczesny was at fault for both goals during a 2-0 defeat by Southampton. It later emerged that the Poland goalkeeper was caught smoking in the showers after the game. Ospina kept his place for the league game the following week and has played every Premier League match since. Did you know...

Article: Chelsea's Eden Hazard and Arsenal's Santi Cazorla are set to reach a Premier League milestone this weekend when they each make their 100th appearance. Both players have been hugely influential since they moved to London in the summer of 2012, but who has been the most exciting import to watch? Here, Sportsmail's reporters choose the player they most enjoy seeing in action. Eden Hazard (L) and Santi Cazorla are both set to make their 100th Premier League appearance this weekend. Lee Clayton. Cazorla has wonderful balance. So does Hazard. Cazorla scores important goals. So does Hazard. Cazorla is two-footed. So is Hazard. Cazorla dances past opponents. So does Hazard. So, while there is not a lot to choose between them and Hazard is likely to get the most picks in this article, I am going for Cazorla. It's a personal choice. He is a wonderful footballer. I have paid to watch them both (and I will pay to watch them both again), but the little Spanish magician edges it for me. VERDICT: CAZORLA. Cazorla, pictured in action against Burnley, has been an influential part of Arsenal's midfield this season. Ian Ladyman. I remember when Manchester City baulked at paying Hazard's wages when the Belgian was up for grabs in 2012. Back then City thought the young forward had a rather high opinion of his own worth for a player who was yet to play in a major European league. In the early days of his time at Chelsea, it looked as though City may have been right. He showed flashes of brilliance but also looked rather too easy to push off the ball. Roll forward to 2015, however, and the 24-year-old has developed in to one of the most important players in the Barclays Premier League. Brave, strong and ambitious, Hazard plays on the front foot and with only one thought in this mind. Rather like Cristiano Ronaldo, he has also developed in to the type of player ever defender hates, simply because he gets back up every time he is knocked to the ground. He would get in every team in the Premier League and is one of the reasons Chelsea will win the title this season. VERDICT: HAZARD. Hazard controls the ball under pressure from Stoke midfielder Stephen Ireland at Stamford Bridge. Dominic King. It has to be Hazard. I saw him play for Lille twice in the season before he joined Chelsea – once against St Etienne, the other was what proved to be his final appearance against Nancy. He scored two in the first match, a hat-trick the latter and played a different game to those around him. He hasn't disappointed since arriving here and I love the nonchalance with which he takes a penalty, his low centre of gravity and the way he can bamboozle defenders. If there is such a thing as £32million bargain, it is Hazard. VERDICT: HAZARD. Hazard celebrates after scoring a fine individual goal in Chelsea's 3-2 win against Hull in March. Nick Harris. Now this is a tricky one because while Eden Hazard will frequently embark on a dribble or dink in a pass that will make you nod in appreciation, he'll also miss a penalty and make you groan. Whereas the older Cazorla, less flashy but no less of a technical master, is to my mind more of a fulcrum, more important relatively to the sum of Arsenal's parts than Hazard is to Chelsea. You'll gasp at Hazard but Cazorla's wow factor is richer. That's not to dismiss either: both are brilliant footballers, contributing goals, assists and flair. Any neutral would bite your hand off to have either playing in your team. Forced to pick though, it's Cazorla, for his consistency and crucially doing it in the biggest games. Exhibit A would be Manchester City 0 Arsenal 2 in January; goal, assist, all-round brilliance, against a big team, at an important time. VERDICT: CAZORLA. Cazorla scores from the penalty spot in Arsena's 2-0 away win at Manchester City in January. Riath Al-Samarrai. Eden Hazard for me. Cazorla is an utter delight, a little pinball of a man who is probably the most two-footed player I've seen. Put him in a tight space and then you see what makes him rare among the best. But Hazard is the top player in the Premier League, in my opinion. This is the sixth of his eight seasons as a professional where he has reached double figures and yet he offers so much more than goals (36 in 99 in the Premier League for Chelsea). He can beat a man and, better still, you sense he likes doing it. Technically, his passing and shooting are excellent and he also has a mind capable of sussing out the shapes and systems in front of him. That intelligence, more specifically his speed of thought, is probably what makes separates the good from the brilliant. A complete player who doesn't yet seem to have the complete ego. VERDICT: HAZARD. Hazard gets away from Manchester City duo Fernando (left) and Martin Demichelis at Stamford Bridge. Laurie Whitwell. Has to be Hazard for me. The way he carries the ball through ever tightening spaces and emerges the other side is a joy. Like one of those Indiana Jones impossible escapes from a sliding door or rolling boulder. And his penalties are mesmeric. I could watch them again and again not working out how he does it. VERDICT: HAZARD. Belgium international Hazard scores a header past West Ham goalkeeper Adrian at Upton Park. Sami Mokbel. Both are marvellous players, but I could watch Santi Cazorla all day. When he first arrived in England I remember, whilst sitting in the Upton Park press box, trying to work out whether he was left or right footed. He was wonderful that day as Arsenal cruised to a 3-1 win; it was one of the most complete performances I've seen live. In truth, I've still got no idea whether he's left or right footed. He's that natural on either. Hazard is a phenomenon, but aesthetically no on can touch Cazorla in the Premier League. VERDICT: CAZORLA. Cazorla grins after scoring Arsenal's fourth goal against Aston Villa at the Emirates in February. Jack Gaughan. From a purely artistic sense, Santi Cazorla is probably the most graceful individual on the ball in the entire Premier League. But Eden Hazard provides moments to really stick in the memory. He glides past opponents effortlessly and regularly chips in with important goals - plenty of them stunning in their execution. Worth the ticket alone. The one blot from Cazorla's point of view is that his genius can be fleeting. VERDICT: HAZARD. Sam Cunningham. Jose Mourinho has told him to add more goals to his game to move on a par with Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo and, three years younger than the Argentine and six than the Portuguese, he is not far from doing that. I've watched Hazard countless times at Stamford Bridge this season and he makes the game seem like an art form with his movement, dribbling and passing. Cazorla can excite at times, but he is nowhere near consistently reaching Hazard's level. For me there is no contest between the pair. VERDICT: HAZARD. Hazard tucks home yet another penalty during Chelsea 2-1 win against Stoke City last weekend. Craig Hope. I would far rather have Hazard in my team, but I can't help but feel the excitement has been stripped from him under Jose Mourinho. Efficient, technically brilliant, effective and hard-working he most certainly is - and he will be crowned PFA Player of the Year - but he is no longer the daring dribbler of whom we heard so much about during his teenage years in France. He is, though, arguably a better player for Mourinho's influence. Cazorla, meanwhile, would never thrive under Mourinho, there is too much of Juan Mata about him. But there is no doubt he is thrilling to watch on his day - it's just a shame those days aren't as frequent as they should be for a player of his calibre. VERDICT: HAZARD. RESULT: HAZARD 7-3 CAZORLA. Hazard has been voted as a more exciting player than Cazorla in Sportsmail's survey.

Summarize the above article in 1 sentence.
Chelsea star Eden Hazard is set to make his 100th top-flight appearance. Santi Cazorla should hit the same milestone when Arsenal meet Burnley. Both players have impressed since moving to the Premier League in 2012. Hazard has more goals this season but Cazorla has one more assist. Sportsmail's reporters choose the player who has excited them the most.

Article: A Rajasthan Royals player in India's lucrative domestic cricket league was offered money to influence a game last month but reported the approach to the country's board, the team said on Friday. The player, who was not named, was offered money by a state team mate if he followed a 'pre-decided pattern of play', the Indian Express reported. Confirming the approach, the Rajasthan franchise said the player immediately reported the incident to the Indian cricket board's (BCCI) Anti-Corruption and Security Unit.

'Rajasthan Royals commends the player for having reported this incident immediately and for his honesty and uprightness. 'His dedication to maintain the highest standards of integrity needs to be lauded.' BCCI secretary Anurag Thakur confirmed that the player had informed the anti-corruption unit about the incident. 'A player was approached and he immediately intimated BCCI anti-corruption unit. Glad that BCCI education policy showing positive results,' Thakur said on Twitter. 'Players are alert and they know what is to be done due to our regular education efforts.'

The prestigious private school didn't identify the student, citing federal privacy laws. In a news release, it said the student was no longer on campus and will face student conduct review. The student was identified during an investigation by campus police and the office of student affairs and admitted to placing the noose on the tree early Wednesday, the university said. Officials are still trying to determine if other people were involved. Criminal investigations into the incident are ongoing as well. Students and faculty members marched Wednesday afternoon chanting "We are not afraid. We stand together,"  after pictures of the noose were passed around on social media. At a forum held on the steps of Duke Chapel, close to where the noose was discovered at 2 a.m., hundreds of people gathered. "You came here for the reason that you want to say with me, 'This is no Duke we will accept. This is no Duke we want. This is not the Duke we're here to experience. And this is not the Duke we're here to create,' " Duke President Richard Brodhead told the crowd. The incident is one of several recent racist events to affect college students. Last month a fraternity at the University of Oklahoma had its charter removed after a video surfaced showing members using the N-word and referring to lynching in a chant. Two students were expelled. In February, a noose was hung around the neck of a statue of a famous civil rights figure at the University of Mississippi. A statement issued by Duke said there was a previous report of hate speech directed at students on campus. In the news release, the vice president for student affairs called the noose incident a "cowardly act." "To whomever committed this hateful and stupid act, I just want to say that if your intent was to create fear, it will have the opposite effect," Larry Moneta said Wednesday. Duke University is a private college with about 15,000 students in Durham, North Carolina. CNN's Dave Alsup contributed to this report.

Article: Andre Ayew is keen on a move to Liverpool this summer. The Ghana international will be a free agent as he is out of contract at Marseille and wants to join the Anfield club who he supported as a boy. Everton, Newcastle and Swansea have all shown interest while Ayew's representatives have held talks with Roma. Wolfsburg, Borussia Dortmund and Napoli are also keen to speak to him. Ayew, 25, was born in France but followed his father Abedi Pele by playing for Ghana where he has become one of their star performers notably scoring in the World Cup finals last summer against USA and eventual winners Germany. Andre Ayew is out of contract at Marseille in the summer and is keen on a move to England. The Ghana international admits he supported Liverpool as a boy and would like to play for the Anfield club. Although emotionally attached to Marseille, he admits he is seeking a new challenge and is ready to test himself in the Premier League. Talking to Sportsmail, he said: 'I'm a Marseille boy, I love Marseille, the club, the fans, the area, it's a great place to play football and I will continue to speak to them but it's true I'd like to play in England.' Ayew, who is represented in England by agent Mark McKay of ExcelFoot, added: 'I grew up watching English football and I support Liverpool. Steven Gerrard is my favourite player. They have always had exciting teams and now they are a club that likes to play with pace and give chances to young players. Ayew's favourite player growing up was Steven Gerrard, who will leave Liverpool at the end of the season. A player he knew from their time together at Marseille, Ayew speaks regularly to Joey Barton (right) 'I'm 25 now and it is a good age for me to take the next step in my career. I have offers from England, Italy and Germany but it would be unfair to say who from. I speak to my friends such as Morgan Amalfitano at West Ham and Joey Barton at QPR and they always talk well about the league and the atmosphere. 'I have been fortunate to experience Stamford Bridge and Old Trafford in the Champions League but I want to play at Anfield and other grounds. 'I know my quality. I have shown I can play at Marseille and I have taken on responsibility with my country. It's important that you always strive to be better. You see with players such as Eden Hazard how hard they work and I believe in hard work to get better. It's easy to talk though, what is important is that I do it.' The Ghana international is also being looked at by Swansea, Newcastle and Everton in the Premier League. Liverpool have already secured the signing of Divock Origi (left), who will move to Anfield in the summer. Ayew's ideal is to help Marseille win the French league but it will be difficult as they trail leaders Paris Saint-Germain by five points. 'I will fight to the end for Marseille then I will make my decision. It is an important step for me.' Liverpool already have Divock Origi in the bag and are keen on Burnley's Danny Ings but will be enthused that a player of Ayew's pedigree has such desire to play for them. Failure to reach the Champions League could also mean he falls within their budget as a free transfer. Brendan Rodgers wants a goalkeeper, midfielder and a full-back as well as a forward. He likes Memphis Depay at PSV Eindhoven but the Holland international is expected to join Manchester United.

Article: Daniel Ricciardo has called for a back-to-basics approach for Red Bull to forge a return to the front of the grid. Second best to Mercedes last season after a run of four successive championship triumphs, Red Bull have struggled at the start of this year. To rub salt into the wounds, Red Bull even found themselves trailing'sister' team Toro Rosso at the last race in Malaysia. Daniel Ricciardo in action during practice for this weekend's Chinese Grand Prix. The Australian driver has urged his Red Bull team to go back to basics after a troubled start to 2015. The main gripe has centred on power-unit supplier Renault, with billionaire benefactor Dietrich Mateschitz suggesting this week he could pull his team out of the sport if matters fail to improve. Ahead of this weekend's grand prix in China, Ricciardo concedes Red Bull are exploring numerous avenues to correct the problems. The Australian managed to finish third quickest in practice, a second behind reigning champion Lewis Hamilton in his Mercedes and four tenths of a second adrift of Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen. 1. Lewis Hamilton Mercedes 1:37.219. 2. Kimi Raikkonen Ferrari 1:37.662. 3. Daniel Ricciardo Red Bull - Renault 1:38.311. 4. Sebastian Vettel Ferrari 1:38.339. 5. Nico Rosberg Mercedes 1:38.399. 6. Daniil Kvyat Red Bull - Renault 1:38.737. 7. Valtteri Bottas Williams-Mercedes 1:38.850. 8. Felipe Nasr Sauber - Ferrari 1:39.032. 9. Romain Grosjean Lotus - Mercedes 1:39.142. 10. Jenson Button  McLaren 1:39.275. 11. Pastor Maldonado  Lotus - Mercedes 1:39.444. 12. Fernando Alonso  McLaren 1:39.743. 13. Marcus Ericsson Sauber - Ferrari 1:39.751. 14. Max Verstappen Toro Rosso - Renault 1:39.894. 15. Carlos Sainz Jr Toro Rosso - Renault 1:39.971. 16. Nico Hulkenberg  Force India - Mercedes 1:40.151. 17. Felipe Massa Williams-Mercedes 1:40.423. 18. Sergio Perez Force India - Mercedes 1:40.868. 19. Roberto Merhi  Marussia - Ferrari 1:42.973. 20. Will Stevens  Marussia - Ferrari 1:44.564. 'We are experimenting with a few things, but I think for now we have to go back to what we know, get our basics right,' said Ricciardo. 'We have done quite a bit. In Malaysia we had brake issues, a lot of overheating, so we have reverted back on a few things, even from last year which we knew was more efficient. 'Just because it's from last year it doesn't mean it's not better, so I guess we have taken a step back in that direction. The team has done quite a lot to rectify some issues and get us further up the grid.' Ricciardo has no doubt Renault are also pulling their weight, adding: 'From Melbourne to Malaysia they made a pretty massive step with driveability. 'We also have a few more software things this weekend, which should give things another pretty significant step on that side. 'I appreciate what everyone is doing to get us back towards the front, so fingers crossed it can be put together in the right way this weekend and if so we can get back into that top five.' Daniil Kvyat was forced to pull off track 19 minutes from the end of FP2 after his brakes caught fire. Team-mate Daniil Kvyat, however, was not so fortunate as the young Russian was forced to pull off track 19 minutes from the end of FP2 after his brakes caught fire. Christian Horner said: 'Something overheated within the rear hub assembly. As a result of that we lost pressure in the master cylinder halfway round the lap. 'We asked him to drive back slowly without using the brakes if at all possible, but unfortunately he had to brake at turn 14 and he had a very slow off. 'It's frustrating it's happened, but all the relevant pieces are intact so we can find out what the root cause was.' Despite suffering brake issues in Malaysia, Horner insists the issue there and the one experienced by Kvyat are 'totally unrelated'. Horner added: 'Today was a one-off and can be sorted for tomorrow.'

Red Bull have endured a difficult start to the new Formula One campaign. Daniel Ricciardo was third quickest during practice for the Chinese GP. The Australian's Red Bull team-mate Daniil Kvyat was sixth fastest. But his brakes caught fire and he was forced to stop on track.

Article: Mario Balotelli hit back at those criticising his absence for Liverpool's FA Cup quarter-final win over Blackburn Rovers due to illness by attempting to prove he had a high temperature. Robbie Savage branded Balotelli 'pathetic' for missing the game, four days after he withdrew himself from the Liverpool squad  for their trip to Arsenal following a'slight knock' suffered in training. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers revealed the £16million striker travelled with the squad to Blackburn, but that he felt too ill to take part after staying over in the hotel with his team-mates. Mario Balotelli responded to Robbie Savage's labelling of the Liverpool striker as 'pathetic' Balotelli was not included in the Liverpool squad to face Arsenal or Blackburn Rovers this week. Brendan Rodgers revealed Balotelli withdrew himself from the squad on Saturday and fell ill on Wednesday. Liverpool scraped through to a Wembley date with Aston Villa in the FA Cup semi-finals thanks to Philippe Coutinho's strike. With 20 minutes remaining at Ewood Park, the Brazilian fired the ball across goal and past Rovers keeper Simon Eastwood. Click here to read Ian Ladyman's report. BT Sport pundit and former Blackburn midfielder Savage said: 'Pathetic isn't it? You're going to miss an FA Cup quarter-final? 'I don't know how unwell he is, but to miss an FA Cup quarter-final when you're feeling a bit ill? Nonsense. I would have to be really, really ill to miss that game.' Balotelli responded by posting a photograph of himself on Instagram, holding a thermometer reading 38.7 Celsius — 1.7C above 'normal' body temperature. Philippe Coutinho fires home the winner to send Liverpool into the FA Cup semi-final against Reading. Coutinho celebrates with his team-mates as Liverpool keep their dreams of winning a trophy alive. Mario Balotelli reported a temperature of 38.7C (101.66F) which is indeed above the normal body temperature of 37C (99.5F). The Liverpool striker may also have felt hot, sweaty, thirsty, very uncomfortable and slightly hungry. He may also have felt tired. Should body temperature reach 40C (104F), the person will be dehydrated and may suffer from vomiting and dizziness. With the snap, Balotelli wrote: 'Nothing stop me to watch my team winning. At least this time you know the real reason I am out. Miss the pitch so much #unluckyseason #YNWA #illbeback [sic].' Rodgers planned to use Balotelli for the FA Cup tie, but  admitted it was at the final moment his misfiring striker became unavailable. 'Mario travelled with us. He trained well, [but] fell ill last night,' Rodgers said ahead of the match which ended 1-0 to Liverpool. 'He stayed overnight with us in the hotel, [but] woke up still not feeling great. The doctors' advice was to send him back.' Balotelli's absence follows the Italian missing last Saturday's 4-1 defeat by Arsenal. The striker did not travel to the Emirates for the crunch clash after sustaining a hamstring injury in training on Friday. Rodgers said at the time: 'He trained on Friday afternoon with the team and he took a slight knock to his knee and he deemed himself not able to travel. 'I'm not a medic. He felt it was too sore to travel. The medical staff have looked at it. It was just something that he himself didn't feel comfortable enough to travel.' But Balotelli was reportedly later spotted with a group of friends at a private table at Manchester nightclub One Central Street. BT Sport pundit Savage feels it shows Balotelli's lack of determination to be absent for the FA Cup tie.

Article: (CNN)He's a blue chip college basketball recruit. She's a high school freshman with Down syndrome. At first glance Trey Moses and Ellie Meredith couldn't be more different. But all that changed Thursday when Trey asked Ellie to be his prom date. Trey -- a star on Eastern High School's basketball team in Louisville, Kentucky, who's headed to play college ball next year at Ball State -- was originally going to take his girlfriend to Eastern's prom. So why is he taking Ellie instead? "She's great... she listens and she's easy to talk to" he said. Trey made the prom-posal (yes, that's what they are calling invites to prom these days) in the gym during Ellie's P.E. class. Trina Helson, a teacher at Eastern, alerted the school's newspaper staff to the prom-posal and posted photos of Trey and Ellie on Twitter that have gone viral. She wasn't surpristed by Trey's actions. "That's the kind of person Trey is," she said. To help make sure she said yes, Trey entered the gym armed with flowers and a poster that read "Let's Party Like it's 1989," a reference to the latest album by Taylor Swift, Ellie's favorite singer. Trey also got the OK from Ellie's parents the night before via text. They were thrilled. "You just feel numb to those moments raising a special needs child,"  said Darla Meredith, Ellie's mom. "You first feel the need to protect and then to overprotect." Darla Meredith said Ellie has struggled with friendships since elementary school, but a special program at Eastern called Best Buddies had made things easier for her. She said Best Buddies cultivates friendships between students with and without developmental disabilities and prevents students like Ellie from feeling isolated and left out of social functions. "I guess around middle school is when kids started to care about what others thought," she said, but "this school, this year has been a relief." Trey's future coach at Ball State, James Whitford, said he felt great about the prom-posal, noting that Trey, whom he's known for a long time, often works with other kids. Trey's mother, Shelly Moses, was also proud of her son. "It's exciting to bring awareness to a good cause," she said. "Trey has worked pretty hard, and he's a good son." Both Trey and Ellie have a lot of planning to do. Trey is looking to take up special education as a college major, in addition to playing basketball in the fall. As for Ellie, she can't stop thinking about prom. "Ellie can't wait to go dress shopping" her mother said. "Because I've only told about a million people!" Ellie interjected.

Article: These are the horrific final moments of a 44-year-old suspect who was apparently accidentally shot dead by a 73-year-old reserve deputy last week after he fired his handgun instead of his Taser. In the footage, released by police, deputies are filmed chasing after Eric Harris, first by car then on foot, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on April 2 after he fled during a sting operation in a nearby parking lot. Once they catch up to Harris, they tackle him to the ground and order him to lie on his stomach. Robert Bates then yells, 'Taser! Taser!' - but takes out his service weapon and pulls the trigger. After firing one round into Harris, the former full-time officer drops his gun from the recoil and says in shock: 'Oh, I shot him! I'm sorry.' Harris then starts yelping on the ground, while pleading for help. WARNING: GRAPHIC VIDEO. Chase: This newly-released video of Eric Harris's fatal shooting shows deputies chasing after Harris, first by car then on foot, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on April 2 after he fled during a sting operation in a nearby parking lot. Fleeing: The deputies run after Harris, who was allegedly caught trying to buy drugs and a gun from cops. View from the ground: Once they catch up to Harris, they tackle him to the ground and order him to lie on his stomach. Robert Bates then yells, 'Taser! Taser!' (pictured) - but takes out his handgun and pulls the trigger. The fatally-wounded man, who is being held down by his neck by the deputies, exclaims: 'Oh my god, he shot me! He shot me! He shot me, man.' He then adds: 'Oh, my god. I'm losing my breath.' Shockingly, one of the deputies replies: 'F*** your breath.' Another calls Harris, who is black and dressed in shorts and a T-shirt, a'motherf***er' and tells him: 'You shouldn't have f***ing ran.' Following the incident, during which the deputies do not appear to realize Harris has been fatally injured and even tell him to'shut the f*** up', the suspect was hospitalized. He died an hour later. The footage, obtained by NewsOn6, comes as a number of US shootings  involving police officers and  black suspects have hit the headlines. Many of the suspects were unarmed at the time. In the April 2 incident, Bates accidentally fired his gun thinking that he had pulled out his Taser - as proved by the fact he did not expect the weapon to recoil, the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office said. Bates, who had been monitoring the situation from afar, ran up to Harris in a bid 'to get the situation under control', before mistakenly firing his gun instead of his Taser, according to on-site deputies. Apology: After firing one round into Harris, the former full-time officer drops his gun from the recoil and says in shock: 'Oh, I shot him! I'm sorry' (pictured) Harris then starts yelping on the ground, while shouting, 'Help!' Shooting: This photo shows a deputy bending down to pick up Bates's dropped gun following the 'accidental' shooting in Tulsa earlier this month. Harris is being held down on the ground, out of shot, by other deputies. Terrified: The fatally-wounded man, who is being held by his neck and back by the deputies (pictured), says: 'Oh my god, he shot me! He shot me! He shot me, man.' He then adds: 'Oh, my god. I'm losing my breath' Suspect: Shockingly, one of the deputies replies: 'F*** your breath.' Another calls Harris (pictured in a police mug shot released d by officials on April 4) a'motherf***er' and tells him: 'You shouldn't have f***ing ran' Harris, who was being restrained at the time, had  allegedly fled after he was caught trying to buy drugs and a gun from deputies posing as dealers in the parking lot of a nearby dollar store. Major Shannon Clark told CNN: 'They were struggling trying to get him into custody, he ran up trying to use a less lethal device, trying to get the situation under control. 'Inadvertently he discharged a round from his service weapon.' He added: 'Did an accident happen? Sure. But is it accredited to his age? Or was it accredited to the rapidly evolving situation? I guess that will be determined in the investigation.' Bates, who has been a reserve since 2008, is the chief executive of Robert C Bates LLC, a Tulsa-based insurance company, who worked as an officer assigned to the Violent Crimes Task Force. Fatal: Following the incident, during which the deputies told Harris to'shut the f*** up', the suspect was hospitalized. He died an hour later. Above, blood appears to be running down Harris's arm at the scene. Scene: In this photo, which has been partially blanked out by the Sheriff's Office, deputies are pictured at the scene of the incident. The deputy in the foreground of the frame is holding down Harris following the shooting. He has also spent time with the Tulsa Police Auxiliary. Speaking to local site News OK, Bates said: 'It was me. My attorney has advised me not to comment. As much as I would like to, I can’t.' According to Tulsa Police, Harris had met an undercover officer to sell him a 9 mm semi-automatic pistol and 300 rounds ammunition. He fled the scene when deputies tried to arrest him, it is alleged. The suspect then fought with another deputy when he was shot, police said. He was gunned down accidentally by Bates after officers 'observed him reaching for his waistband area... causing concern for the deputies' safety,' authorities told CNN. Officers had been monitoring Harris as part of an investigation into the trade of methamphetamine. As he met with undercover deputies to allegedly hand over the drugs, he is accused of offering to throw in a sawed-off gun. Confusion: Bates, 73, accidentally grabbed his pistol and shot Harris (right, in a previous mug shot) dead, according to Tulsa police. Bates is classified as an advanced deputy. The incident is now under investigation. His convictions include escaping prison in 1990, robbery with a dangerous weapon in 1999, and making threatening phone calls. According to Tulsa Police, Harris' killer, Bates, is classified as an advanced deputy. Reserves are 'basic', 'intermediate', or 'advanced'. The qualify for 'advanced', officers are required to have a minimum of 320 hours of training and 25 hours of training a year. During the annual field training program, they are tested on how to use and identify lethal and non-lethal weapons. With the same power as paid deputies, reserves can conduct their own investigations, make arrests and work on task forces. The cause of Harris's death is under investigation.

Article: John Carver is threatening changes when Newcastle face Liverpool on Monday night as he admits concerns remain over the character of his players. It is no secret United are planning a major overhaul of their squad this summer and 'personality' will rank high when it comes to identifying transfer targets. The trip to Anfield is Newcastle's first outing since losing a fifth straight Tyne-Wear derby and they have now won just twice in 2015. John Carver says his Newcastle players have a point to prove when they face Liverpool on Monday. Newcastle in training earlier this week for their game against Liverpool on Monday in the Premier League. Moussa Sissoko (left), Vurnon Anita (centre) and Massadio Haidara (right) take a break during the session. And Carver said: 'Maybe I need to change the team and hope that sparks something. 'We are going to need characters and I want to see some energy. I didn't see energy last weekend. We talked about out-working the opposition but they out-worked us again. 'So there's something not right within their DNA when it comes to a derby game. 'There's something not right within their make-up. No matter how hard you try and no matter what you try and do, it's an issue.' Carver has now seen his Newcastle team lose four in a row and fall into relegation danger. Newcastle were beaten in last weekend's Tyne/Wear derby by Jermain Defoe's stunning volley. That being the case, Carver says close-season recruitment will focus on mental attributes as much as physical. 'You've got to try and do as much homework as you can to find out about their personality,' he said. 'But with the amount of foreign players coming in now it's a tougher situation. 'I've done this in the past when I've gone to watch a player and sat with their fans. You can actually start having a conversation about them and try to find out a little bit about their character. What's he like? Does he get many red cards? Is he aggressive? Has he got a bit of a problem socially? All those little things help to build a bigger picture. 'But for now it is about finishing our season with pride and the players proving a point to themselves, because some of them are playing for their future.'

Newcastle have lost their last four Premier League games. John Carver's side lost 1-0 to Sunderland in the Tyne-Wear derby. The Magpies have won just twice in 2015 ahead of their Anfield trip.

Article: Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has confessed his academy players are not ready to step into his first-team squad, hinting that City may look to cherry-pick the best youngsters from their top-flight rivals. In the week that Liverpool’s Raheem Sterling spoke about his unwillingness to agree a new contract at Anfield, Pellegrini’s comments suggest that City may look to invest heavily in other teams’ homegrown talent this summer. Premier League regulations require clubs to carry at least eight homegrown players, which can include youngsters who have spent three of their formative years at an English club. FA chairman Greg Dyke is pushing for the figure to be raised to 12. Manuel Pellegrini says the academy players at Manchester City are not ready for the first team. Pellegrini's assertions may mean City buy English players like Raheem Sterling to reach homegrown quotas. Everton's England international midfield player Ross Barkley has also been linked with City. But the lack of suitable candidates emerging from Patrick Vieira’s academy means City’s only option will be to buy in the bulk of their quota, with the defending league champions also linked with Arsenal’s Jack Wilshere and Ross Barkley of Everton. City’s current group of home-grown players will be reduced in the summer when Frank Lampard departs and it could be further depleted if James Milner, who wants guarantees of more regular first-team football, opts to leave. Coincidentally, Liverpool is Milner’s most likely destination should he leave but the prospect of Sterling moving in the opposite direction has been increased to the point that bookmakers rate City his most likely destination next season. City’s youth system has come under fire in recent seasons for its lack of productivity. Belgian defender Dedryck Boyata, who has started nine league games in nearly six years at City, is the only former academy player anywhere near first-team contention. Pellegrini said: ‘We must be patient with the academy. Young players are important. Maybe it’s not so easy for young players, especially at big clubs, to play in the first team, with the professional squad. But I’m sure in the future we will have very important players coming from the academy. James Milner could leave City in the summer with Liverpool a potential destination. Arsenal midfield player Jack Wilshere has also been linked with a transfer to City. Defender Dedryck Boyata (right) is City's only academy player near first-team contention. ‘But it’s important to have years of working the same way. But you never know. Maybe some talented young players can do it soon.’ Sterling would fit the bill, if his impasse at Liverpool proves unsolvable, although Pellegrini refused to comment directly about the Liverpool and England forward. Pellegrini said: ‘I think it’s important for big clubs to bring in the best players, that’s the most important thing. If they’re all good players, of course I agree with the quota. All the big leagues — especially the Premier League — need the best players to play.’ City’s homegrown quota is made up of Boyata, Lampard, Milner, Joe Hart, reserve keeper Richard Wright and Gael Clichy, who qualifies from his years spent with Arsenal. They are joined by four academy players — Thierry Ambrose, George Glendon, Jose Angel Tasende and Jose Angel Pozo, although Spaniard Pozo is the only one to have been near the first team this season. A number of young City professionals, including John Guidetti at Celtic, PSV’s Karim Rekik and Marcos Lopes with Lille, are on loan and may be brought back to plug some of the holes next season, although a big investment in English talent via the transfer market seems the only option. Frank Lampard helps make up City's homegrown quota but is leaving for New York at the end of the season. Patrick Vieira is overseeing the City academy's production of youth and homegrown players. Striker John Guidetti is on loan at Celtic but could return to meet quota regulations next season. Meanwhile, Pellegrini is not in action until Monday, when he takes his team to Crystal Palace, and with Chelsea in an apparently commanding lead at the top, the City manager admits his side face eight cup finals. He said: ‘I hope we can do it. We have to play eight finals from now until the end. We will see the way we play. I hope the way we finish against West Brom is the way we must continue. ‘It is not easy to make a clear analysis because they play with one player less. I hope in these eight games we continue playing that way.’

Manuel Pellegrini believes his youth players are not ready for the first-team. His homegrown quote will be depleted when Frank Lamapard leaves. Pellegrini may lose James Milner, forcing him to invest in home talent.

Article: (CNN)Governments around the world are using the threat of terrorism -- real or perceived -- to advance executions, Amnesty International alleges in its annual report on the death penalty. "The dark trend of governments using the death penalty in a futile attempt to tackle real or imaginary threats to state security and public safety was stark last year," said Salil Shetty, Amnesty's Secretary General in a release. "It is shameful that so many states around the world are essentially playing with people's lives -- putting people to death for 'terrorism' or to quell internal instability on the ill-conceived premise of deterrence." The report, "Death Sentences and Executions 2014," cites the example of Pakistan lifting a six-year moratorium on the execution of civilians following the horrific attack on a school in Peshawar in December. China is also mentioned, as having used the death penalty as a tool in its "Strike Hard" campaign against terrorism in the restive far-western province of Xinjiang. The annual report catalogs the use of state-sanctioned killing as a punitive measure across the globe, and this year's edition contains some mixed findings. On one hand, the number of executions worldwide has gone down by almost 22% on the previous year. At least 607 people were executed around the world in 2014, compared to 778 in 2013. Amnesty's figures do not include statistics on executions carried out in China, where information on the practice is regarded as a state secret. Belarus and Vietnam, too, do not release data on death penalty cases. "The long-term trend is definitely positive -- we are seeing a decrease in the number of executions (worldwide)," Audrey Gaughran, Amnesty's Director of Global Issues, told CNN. "A number of countries are closer to abolition, and there are some signs that some countries will be abolitionist by 2015. (There are) signals of a world that is nearing abolition." While the report notes some encouraging signs, it also highlights a marked increase in the number of people sentenced to death in 2014. At least 2,466 people globally are confirmed to have been handed the sentence last year, an increase of 28% compared with 2013. The report notes that the spike in sentencing is attributable to mass-sentencing in countries including Egypt and Nigeria, "against scores of people in some cases." The organization found "positive developments" worldwide, with most regions seeming to show reductions in the number of executions. Opinion: Sharp spike in death sentences. Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, saw a 28% fall in reported cases, and executions recorded in the Middle East and North Africa were down 23% compared to 2013. "Even though we've highlighted some of the negative developments... I think we would always highlight that there are positive developments," Gaughran said. "Across the board, with the exception of Europe and Central Asia there were fewer reports of executions in every region." The resumption of the use of capital punishment in Belarus -- the only country in Europe and Central Asia to execute people -- after a two year hiatus spoiled an near-universal decrease in countries using the death penalty by region. The United States has the dubious distinction of being the only country in the Americas to conduct executions, but the number of convicts put to death here fell slightly, from 39 in 2013 to 35 in 2014. The state of Washington also imposed a moratorium on executions last year. The U.S. remains one of the worst offenders for imposing capital punishment, with only Iran (289+), Iraq (61+), and Saudi Arabia (90+) executing more people in 2014. While figures are not available, Amnesty estimates that China also executes "thousands" of prisoners each year, "more than the rest of the world put together." The report also highlights the imperfections in the judiciary processes that lead to many sentenced to death. "In the majority of countries where people were sentenced to death or executed, the death penalty was imposed after proceedings that did not meet international fair trial standards," the report stated. "In 2014 Amnesty International raised particular concerns in relation to court proceedings in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, China, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Sri Lanka." The United Nations Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, last year stressed the need to move toward abolition of capital punishment. "The taking of life is too irreversible for one human being to inflict it on another," he said, in marking World Day against Death Penalty in October. "We must continue to argue strongly that the death penalty is unjust and incompatible with fundamental human rights." Amnesty estimates that at least 19,094 people were believed to be on death row at the end of 2014.

Article: She captured hearts across the nation as she realized her dream to play for Mount St. Joseph's women's basketball team in Ohio and raised $1.5million - all while battling inoperable brain cancer. And one of the millions Lauren Hill touched was LeBron James, who posted an emotional farewell letter to the teenager via Twitter on Friday, just hours after she passed away from her rare tumor. In the letter, the basketball star, dubbed King James, praised the 19-year-old for the 'leadership', 'courage' and'strength' she had shown while suffering from Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG). James, 30, who had never actually met Lauren, wrote: 'Dear Lauren Hill, You are the true definition of strength, courage, power, leadership, etc etc! Your time spent on earth will never be forgotten.

'Don't be afraid, she knows you cause we spoke about u plenty of times Until we officially meet again, take care and continue to be that LEADER we all love! ‪#‎RIPLaurenHill.' The Cleveland Cavaliers player signed off the letter - which was posted to his Twitter page - 'Sincerely, LeBron James'. The letter has since been retweeted tens of thousands of times. Many users have deemed the tribute 'touching' and 'beautiful'. One told James - who competed against the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday night - that it 'was so sweet it brought me to tears'. Lauren, who was diagnosed with a rare form of brain cancer shortly after her 18th birthday, had repeatedly defied doctors' expectations after they told her that she would not live past December. A touching tribute: James told Lauren not to have 'too much fun up there without all your family and friends' 'Tell my Grandma I said hello': He added that he had spoken 'plenty of times' about Lauren to his grandmother. #RIPLaurenHill: The Cleveland Cavaliers player signed off the letter - which was posted to his Twitter page - 'Sincerely, LeBron James' (pictured). The letter has since been retweeted tens of thousands of times. Instead, the Indiana native played four games with her team at Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati, and raised more than $1.5 million for research into the cancer she suffered from. But as her condition worsened, the teenager became an honorary coach and earlier this year, she moved to Cincinnati Children's Hospital. She passed away at the hospital on Friday morning. As news of her death became public, thousands of people across the country - both basketball fans and not - took to social media to express their sorrow at her death, and show support for her family. Only a year and a half ago, Lauren, whose cancer saw her rapidly gain weight, had been just another teenager preparing for college after deciding to play basketball for Mount St. Joseph. But a few weeks later, she started feeling dizzy while playing for her high school team in nearby Lawrenceburg, Indiana. Tests found her tumor and she was told she had less than two years left. Diagnosis: Lauren is pictured left in December 2013, and right, in December 2014, after her treatment for Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG), a rare childhood brain cancer which changed her appearance. Brave: Lauren, who used her limited energy to inspire people and raise money for research into the cancer that ultimately took her life, is pictured in her room in Cincinnati last December - months before she passed away. In September, doctors gave her the devastating news she wouldn't make it past December - and after years as a standout player, Lauren's hopes of playing college basketball were put in jeopardy. However, the NCAA granted permission to move the school's opening game forward because of her worsening condition. On November 2, Lauren realized her dream of playing for the school. Incredibly, she scored the first and last baskets of the team's 66-55 victory over Hiram College. Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a type of brain tumor found in the part of the brainstem at the lower back of the brain. Due to the tumor's location, it can cause double vision, difficulty controlling eye movement and facial expressions, and difficulty swallowing and chewing. It may also cause weakness in the limbs. The condition primarily affects children most often between the ages of four and nine. Between 100 and 150 new diagnoses are made a year in the U.S. Only 300 are made across North America and Europe a year. It can be treated with radiation, but chemotherapy is generally not effective and surgery is impossible due to the spread of the cancer into healthy tissue. Unlike with other childhood cancers, there has been little progress in improving treatments and cure rates for the condition over the last few decades. Fewer than 10 per cent of children with DIPG survive two years after their diagnosis. Source: DIPG Registry. 'It's a dream come true,' Lauren told reporters at the time. 'To play on a college court, to put my foot down on the floor and hear the roar of the crowd - I just love it so much. I love basketball. 'Everything that happened today was amazing. I'm truly happy, it's a really good day.' At the game, Lauren said she wanted to find a cure for the rare cancer, which has a less than 10 per cent survival rate and most often affects children aged four to nine. 'When I was diagnosed I remember kind of feeling lonely because nobody understood,' she said following the game, USA Today reported. 'And now that more people know about this story and the awareness of DIPG. 'I'm so happy that people know about it now and that we can get some research going and hopefully find that home run cure for cancer. And even though I'm probably not going to be around to see it, it's going to help a lot of people.' Lauren played in four games and made five layups before the spreading tumor made her stop. When the season ended, her team held its annual dinner in the hospital where Hill was being treated. She was also honored at local sporting events and was featured on a box of Wheaties - known as the Breakfast of Champions. The U.S. Basketball Writers Association voted her the Pat Summitt Most Courageous Award, which is normally awarded at the Final Four. Athletes from other colleges autographed No. 22 jerseys - her number - and sent them in support. As the cancer slowed her down, Lauren's family, friends and teammates took a bigger role in promoting her fundraising campaign - and she kept reminding everyone to appreciate life. 'Life is precious,' she told WKRC-TV before her death. 'Every moment you get with someone is a moment that's blessed, really blessed.' Final days: Lauren is pictured enjoying Easter (left) and St Patrick's Day (right) from hospital in Cincinnati. Fighter: The NCAA moved Mount St. Joseph's first basketball game forward last November (pictured) so that Lauren could achieve her dream of playing for collegiate basketball. She scored the first and last baskets. The co-founder of her nonprofit foundation confirmed Lauren's death in hospital on Friday. 'Through Lauren's fundraising and advocacy efforts, she not only became a spotlight on the lack of funding for cancer research, but she most certainly has become a beacon guiding researchers for years to come,' The Cure Starts Now co-founder Brooke Desserich said. Her nonprofit foundation helped to raise more than $1.5 million for cancer research. 'She's made an impact on the world, more so than me - more than I ever will do,' Lauren's coach Dan Benjamin said. 'I've gotten so many emails and phone calls from all over the world. People are contacting me because they want to share her story.' No information about a memorial has yet been released, but Lawrenceburg Schools superintendent Karl Galey said on Twitter that schools will be prepared to assist staff and students with counseling. Heroic: Lauren, pictured left, smiles at Pat Summitt after receiving the Pat Summitt Award during halftime of her first NCAA college basketball game in November last year. She went on to play four games for the school. Dear Lauren Hill,. You are the true definition of strength, courage, power, leadership, etc etc! Your time spent on earth will never be forgotten. I [hate] that I never got the chance to meet u in person but know you inspired me the whole time! For every life u touched, u made the biggest impact [on] them by just being YOU!!

Article: (CNN)Andrew Getty, one of the heirs to billions of oil money, appears to have died of natural causes, a Los Angeles Police Department spokesman said. The coroner's preliminary assessment is there was no foul play involved in the death of Getty, grandson of oil tycoon J. Paul Getty, said Detective Meghan Aguilar. Andrew Getty, 47, had "several health issues," Aguilar said, adding that an autopsy will be conducted. There is no criminal investigation underway, he said. Some medication had also been recovered from Getty's home, though investigators don't know whether Getty was taking it or what his medical history was, Ed Winter, assistant chief in the Los Angeles County coroner's office, told CNN affiliate KTLA Tuesday night. KTLA reported that Getty was found on his side near a bathroom in his home. Getty's parents, Ann and Gordon Getty, released a statement confirming their son's death and asking for privacy. Where the Getty family fortune came from. Gordon Getty is one of three living sons of J. Paul Getty, the oil baron who was thought to be the richest man in the world at the time of his death in 1976. Gordon Getty, 81, has a net worth of $2.1 billion, according to Forbes. One other son died in 1958 and another died in 1973. Gordon Getty spearheaded the controversial sale of Getty to Texaco for $10 billion in 1984. In its list of richest American families, Forbes estimated the Gettys' net worth to be about $5 billion.

In his request, Getty said he had been diagnosed with a serious medical condition in 2013. "A rise in my blood pressure places me in grave risk of substantial and irreparable injury or death," he wrote in the petition.

Article: Tony Pulis has discussed pre-season plans with Saido Berahino in an indication he plans to keep the striker beyond the summer transfer window. Berahino is likely to be away with Gareth Southgate’s England under 21 side in the Czech Republic until late June so Pulis has begun his preparations early. West Bromwich Albion were open to bids of £20million for Berahino in January and the 21-year-old has said he would leave to fulfil his desire to play in Champions League football. West Brom manager Tony Pulis has talked pre-season plans with Saido Berahino in an indication the England under 21 striker will remain at The Hawthorns beyond the summer. Berahino has been linked with a move away from West Brom after saying he wants to play European football. Pulis said: ‘Hopefully he's away with the under 21s so I have had a chat with him about pre-season and the time he'll have off but I haven't spoken about anything else to him. ‘I think the kid is happy here, he has played that way and certainly worked that way. We're more than happy to have him here because he has been very good.’ Berahino shares the same agent as Raheem Sterling, Aidy Ward, who was criticised by Brendan Rodgers over the Liverpool player’s contract stand-off. Pulis said: ‘Agents can have a massive influence on players in lots of respects. My argument to that is in the same in life, you get good agents and you get bad agents. Berahino is likely to be included in the England under 21 squad for this summer's European Championships. Berahino scored a vital goal in England's under 21 play-off with Croatia back in October. 'Professional footballers have been given a gift and they have a lifespan of about 10-12 years. We should never forget that. To be the best is what they should be aiming for. ‘If I had an agent I'd just say, 'Look after the money, make sure when I finish this job I have enough to look after my family'. I wouldn't be talking to my agent about football.’ Pulis added: ‘I can’t speak for Sterling and I can't speak for the agent as I haven't dealt with that but the one thing I have said about Saido, he has been fantastic here. ‘There's been a real change in his attitude, his commitment to everything we've tried to do has been brilliant.’

Article: They say you should never forget your roots. Even more so in the case of this striking tree spotted in southern China. The banyan tree in Guangxi province does not stand on a single trunk, but a whole web of roots. It has captured the attention of locals, who say they have watched the whole thing sway in the wind due to its flimsy structure, reported the People's Daily Online. Scroll down for video. Fairy tale: The Banyan looks like enchanted trees found in children’s books. Uprooted: The original tree roots grew up against a wall, before it was moved to a nearby park. Originally the roots of the tree grew up against a wall, but when the wall was demolished the tree was carefully uprooted to its new location Northern Gulf Marine and Cultural Park in Fangchenggang city. The roots then became the trunk of the tree, leading to its strange appearance. These photos show how the entangled trunks look like something straight out of the Enchanted Forest. It is truly remarkable that the web of overlapping roots can support the weight of the tree above. Banyan trees are found in hot climates and known for their extensive roots. Sometimes the roots grow so out of control that they eventually engulf the tree and kill it. Another webbed tree trunk as shown in the video below was spotted in a public park last December in Nanning City -- also in Guangxi -- where monster roots have grown to create a trellis effect. Remarkable: The web is so flimsy that the entire tree sways in the wind. Entangled: The trees are known for their extensive network of roots, which often grow above ground.

Residents on social media described it as a 'quick jolt'. Earlier in the day at 4.35pm a smaller 2.5 magnitude quake hit the same area. That quake was initially reported as a 2.9 magnitude tremor, but was later downgraded by the US Geological Survey. There were no reports of injuries or damages from either incident. Los Angelenos are used to such small tremors, due to the city's positioning on several fault lines.

Article: (CNN)Filipinos are being warned to be on guard for flash floods and landslides as tropical storm Maysak approached the Asian island nation Saturday. Just a few days ago, Maysak gained super typhoon status thanks to its sustained 150 mph winds. It has since lost a lot of steam as it has spun west in the Pacific Ocean. It's now classified as a tropical storm, according to the Philippine national weather service, which calls it a different name, Chedeng. It boasts steady winds of more than 70 mph (115 kph) and gusts up to 90 mph as of 5 p.m. (5 a.m. ET) Saturday. Still, that doesn't mean Maysak won't pack a wallop. Authorities took preemptive steps to keep people safe such as barring outdoor activities like swimming, surfing, diving and boating in some locales, as well as a number of precautionary evacuations. Gabriel Llave, a disaster official, told PNA that tourists who arrive Saturday in and around the coastal town of Aurora "will not be accepted by the owners of hotels, resorts, inns and the like... and will be advised to return to their respective places." Aldczar Aurelio, a meteorologist with the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), said the storm was centered 200 miles southwest of Aurora province as of 5 p.m. (5 a.m. ET) and heading west at a 12.5 mph clip. It's expected to make landfall Sunday morning on the southeastern coast of Isabela province and be out of the Philippines by Monday. Ahead of the storm. Isabela Gov. Faustino Dry III warned Saturday that residents should act as if this will be "no ordinary typhoon." Dry told PNA, "We do not know what the impact will be once it will make landfall."

Article: England suffered an injury scare at the start of their practice'match' here in St Kitts when Stuart Broad dramatically slipped in his delivery stride and was left clutching his ankle on the floor. Broad had complained about the state of the crease, which was damp after overnight rain, after bowling just three balls of his first over of the day at Warner Park. The groundsmen placed sand on the crease but from the very next delivery Broad slipped and went crashing to the ground, a blow which necessitated lengthy treatment before he left the field. Stuart Broad limps out of England's warm-up match in Saint Kitts after slipping over during his delivery. Broad looked to be in considerable pain after the fall and was accompanied by physio Craig de Weymam. Broad required lengthy treatment on the pitch after clutching his left ankle following his fall. Broad looked in some pain as he lay on the ground following his dramatic fall while bowling. The team's medical staff rushed out to the middle to treat Broad following his fall. The Warner Park crease was damp following over night rain, causing the England bowler to slip. Broad went off to receive ice treatment and returned to the action shortly afterwards. England captain Alastair Cook (right) watches on as ground staff make running repairs to the crease. Broad in full stride during his first over as England take on a Saint Kitts and Nevis Invitational XI. Broad was able to walk off himself and after ice treatment should return to the action. England there are no long-term effects but it is a concern for them with the first Test against West Indies starting on Monday in Antigua. It added to the sense of farce surrounding what has become a practice session rather than a second match against one of the worst teams England can ever have played. England attempted to make the most of a bad lot when they loaned Jonathan Trott, Gary Ballance and Jonny Bairstow to their opponents to give them additional practice. But the move backfired for Trott who edged Jimmy Anderson to third slip off just the third ball of the day and departed for a duck to follow the 72 he made on his return to England colours on Monday. Jonathan Trott, who had switched to the Saint Kitts team, was removed for a duck by James Anderson. Shane Jeffers of Saint Kitts is bowled by England's Ben Stokes on day one of the second warm-up match. Stokes celebrates with wicketkeeper Jos Buttler after taking the wicket of Jeffers.

Article: Mark one up for the future of golf over its past and present as 21-year-old Jordan Spieth took the first-day honours with a stunning opening round of 64 on a spectacular day of scoring at the sun-baked 79th Masters. For much of the day it looked as if he might have to share top billing with 34-year-old Justin Rose and 45-year-old Ernie Els, as the Englishman and the South African posted scores of 67 to tie Charley Hoffman, an American representative of the rank and file. Last man out Jason Day would join them in the evening shadows. But by then Spieth had separated himself from the field to become the youngest first-round leader in Masters history with a fabulous run of six birdies in seven holes before adding a wonderful flourish at the 18th, where he brushed in a 25-foot birdie putt. Runner-up on his debut last year, he now owns a three-shot lead going into day two. Jordan Spieth sinks his birdie put on the 18th at Augusta to take a three-shot lead into the second round. Justin Rose made the early running with an impressive five-under-par 67. Rose consoles Gunn Yang after the amateur finished his round on 13 over. Most of the favoured names left Augusta National feeling reasonably content, as Rory McIlroy and defending champion Bubba Watson shot 71, while Dustin Johnson and Masters specialist Phil Mickelson opened with rounds of 70. Whether they will be feeling quite so content at falling so far behind such an awesome talent as the brilliant Texan is another matter. Spieth has barely been off a leader-board all year and there was no chance of him being off this one during this round where he hit flagsticks, holed putts from everywhere and enjoyed the requisite amount of fortune as well as a wayward drive at the 13th bounced off the Georgia pines into the middle of the fairway. It meant when he stood on the par-five 15th tee he was eight under after a scarcely credible 10 single putts on these treacherous greens. At that moment anything seemed possible — even a 62, thereby setting a new standard for scoring in the 155-year history of majors. Only once all day did he act his age and it was here on this risk-reward par five, as he ran up a six. Naturally, Spieth was not about to get greedy. ‘I made a mistake but a 64, my first score in the sixties on this course, I have nothing to complain about,’ he said. A packed crowd watch Rose on the 10th green during the first round. Rose and Charley Hoffman (above) made the early running at Augusta with a 67. South African Ernie Els rolled back the years with a superb 67 on Thursday. Rose in full bloom on day one is a sight as familiar as the glorious azaleas. In nine previous starts Rose has led on three occasions after the first round. Here he equalled his best Masters score, recorded on the opening day in 2004. That year he went on to hold the 36-hole lead as well, while in 2007 he was lying tied second going into the final round, eventually finishing tied fifth. Add all those memories of good days here to the fact he’s now a proven major champion following his US Open triumph in 2013, and there must be the hope this will prove rather more than an excellent opening gambit. Certainly that is how he is seeing it. ‘I’ve learned plenty from those previous occasions, like not getting ahead of yourself,’ he said. ‘I’ve learned that the hard way and now I can’t see any reason why I shouldn’t keep executing the gameplan. You’ve got to believe in yourself, especially when you’re a major winner.’ Els used his ball-striking skills to get out of trouble on the 17th hole during the first round. Rory McIlroy appeared relaxed as he walked down the ninth fairway with Phil Mickelson, right,. McIlroy recovered from a shaky start to finish the first round on one-under-par. Rose wasn’t the only Englishman to prosper, as in-form Paul Casey shot 69. ‘I played with Paul last week and he strikes me as a man with something to prove,’ said Rose. After Greg Norman, Els might be the great hard-luck story when it comes to fabulous players who never quite got it done here. Given how good he was at 25, he represents a cautionary tale for those who believe it inevitable McIlroy will win the Masters one day. Els is still trying, at 45, and what a joy to see one of the great ball-strikers roll back a decade or two rather than the years to post his five-under score. A wonderful eagle three at the 15th was followed by a superlative sand save from a buried lie at the 17th. Only at the last was there a modicum of disappointment. Two putts and it would have been his lowest score in 71 rounds at Augusta. But he took three. McIlroy recovered from a nervously played front nine with some familiar Augusta failings resurfacing as he failed to birdie either par five. Two clunked chip shots at the third and sixth also betrayed a level of tension that illustrated fully the momentous nature of the achievement he is trying to complete in shooting for the career grand slam. American Jordan Spieth celebrates with his caddie Michael Greller on the 18th. Defending champion Bubba Watson struggled to find his rhythm in opening round. Tiger Woods feels the heat with the world No 111 struggling to get under par during the opening round. Woods reacts to a poor chip shot on the third hole as the pressure begins to tell. There were also two encouraging moments during that front nine, however, when he turned what would have been double bogeys in the past into mere bogeys. At the par-five second he drove into a hazard and was staring an ugly seven in the face for openers until he got down in two blows from 100 yards. At the sixth, his mis-hit chip came back down the steep slope but he didn’t panic. He decided to take his putter for the second attempt and got down in two. The value of limiting the damage was emphasised further when he notched his first birdie of the day at the next. On the back nine, it was more like it from the 25-year-old. Over the front nine he had given up three shots on the par fives alone to playing partner Mickelson, but here he got the two birdies on offer at the 13th and the 15th. ‘I left myself in some awkward spots but I holed some good putts on the back nine,’ he said. ‘I was a little nervous on the front nine but mostly just too excited. It was a decent opener.’ The day as a whole was a lot better than that. One to savour, in fact.

The Wildcats are rooted to the foot of the table after eight consecutive defeats. The rout saw a hat-trick of tries by Wolves' Richie Myler and a 28-point haul for Stefan Ratchford.

Wakefield Wildcats coach James Webster said after the game he does not have enough players. Webster said: 'Over six weeks now we haven't had a seven-day turnaround and we find it hard to find some energy. 'I hate looking for excuses but over the last month I think we have spent around two hours as a team training together, for the simple reason I don't have enough people to fulfil training. 'There are no ifs and buts about that — I just don't have enough players. 'We trained for half an hour on our last run as a team simply because we need all our players playing or we will not fulfil our fixtures.' Regarding the defeat to Wolves he added: 'We were totally outclassed. Full credit to Warrington they were outstanding.' The Wildcats now face a Challenge Cup tie against Championship outfit Halifax on Friday night.

Article: (CNN)For the first time in eight years, a TV legend returned to doing what he does best. Contestants told to "come on down!" on the April 1 edition of "The Price Is Right" encountered not host Drew Carey but another familiar face in charge of the proceedings. Instead, there was Bob Barker, who hosted the TV game show for 35 years before stepping down in 2007. Looking spry at 91, Barker handled the first price-guessing game of the show, the classic "Lucky Seven," before turning hosting duties over to Carey, who finished up. Despite being away from the show for most of the past eight years, Barker didn't seem to miss a beat.
