So, at the first bus stop, half of the people got down, which means 12 people remained on the bus. Then, 4 more people got on the bus, so the total number of people on the bus at the first stop is 12 + 4 = 16.

At the second bus stop, 6 people got down and 8 more got on, so the total number of people on the bus at the second stop is 16 - 6 =

One way to do this is to isolate x on one side of the inequality and then check which values of x are less than or equal to 10.

In this case, we can isolate x by subtracting 5 from both sides of the inequality:

- TechRadar's review of the latest iPhone: The new iPhone is a stunning triumph of engineering that sets a new bar for smartphone performance and camera quality. However, the incremental design and high price mean it lacks the 'wow' factor of previous iPhones. Still, its power and intelligence are unrivaled.
